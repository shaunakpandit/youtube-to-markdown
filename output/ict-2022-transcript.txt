all right folks how you doing hope everybody's doing well and this is just a kind of like a prep to get your mindset correct on what's coming in two days and on the youtube channel i want you to understand going forward that obviously you are familiar with my moniker i've dubbed myself the demo baller and i've always talked through the medium of a demo account for my own protection and i've had students come in to my fold and question whether or not it was something that could work in live accounts because they themselves couldn't make it work in either a demo or paper trading because either they could not find it in themselves to submit to the process and the time required for their own individual development or they rushed and did things foolishly outside of the instructions that i provide in mentoring so there's a small faction of individuals on the internet that believe that these things that i teach don't work in a live account and it's never really been an interest in me really to see people fall over me and believe everything i say i've challenged everyone to put the things i teach to test see if the things i'm teaching you are in fact in the marketplace do they deliver more times than that does it provide you a way of finding consistency over a week not every single day perfection because i can't provide that i don't even trade perfectly like that a new trader can new teacher can provide 100 accuracy but the way i teach and the way you'll see me mentoring on this channel in two days is i take the earners okay all of you that are not trading yet or have tried trading and failed you're yearning to learn how to do this okay so i'm teaching with that mindset now some of you obviously may have already been with me and found some consistency and some of you are doing exceedingly well and that's amazing that's great and i'm thankful for all of that but this is really meant for specifically it's for my daughter okay so i sat down and figured i'd kill two birds at one stone and if i can show a simplistic way of going in using the things that i teach stripping it down to its chrome okay no bells and whistles no advanced theories or anything like that what can i do to provide a model that my daughter could look at and say okay there's not a lot of moving parts it's real simple for me to decide what it is i want to do and also when not to do something okay and some of you may already be completely upset with that idea because you want me to come out here and lay an arsenal in your hands of high-tech weaponry it's been my experience that the highest form of analysis concepts that i've been teaching in my own personal mentorship many times creates exceptional traders yes but the majority of them in them being my students they get bogged down in all of the content and it just creates analysis paralysis and it's just too many things for them to decide because like kid in the candy store you know what do you eat first and while you're still chewing on the first thing what are you going to reach for next okay so if you don't have discipline and this is a personal responsibility characteristic that all of you gonna have to really assume okay because i can lay the things in your hands but if you don't respect the fact that they have sharp edges okay or if you use live ammunition before you're really properly trained you could hurt yourself okay so with that idea in mind um i'll be teaching a stripped down version of my concepts in a mentorship style so that way you can go through the process of learning how to do a specific trading model and i'll keep things germane to that model not trying to bring in too many things and one of the approaches is to trade it with index features okay and if you are not interested in trading futures that's fine you can still trade 4x with these concepts as well but i kind of like want to drive it with futures i actually began trading in 1992 as a commodity and futures trader and i moved away from grains and cattle and gold silver crude oil all those types of markets and moved into the bond market the 30-year treasury bond and the s p so when that became my cup of tea if you will i became a better trader intraday and i put down the pursuit of trying to be a long term position trader because i felt that that would be the best thing for me because at the time i was working a job and had to balance all those things like working class individuals need to do they have to commute back and forth to work and those types of things so i figured position trading would be the thing for me and i found out that it didn't work for me okay so i liked the idea of short-term trading intraday trading it made sense to me because i can make quick decisions that may not be your style of trading i will teach you how to apply the things i'm going to teach on the youtube channel how you can scale that up into any time frame so that way there's no excuse for you not to be able to use the information to at least better your understanding in price action okay so here's my promises to you i promise you you're going to learn things that absolutely repeat a lot you are not going to be perfect it's not my goal to make you a perfect trader it's not my goal to make you a perfect analyst my goal is to improve your understanding about price action how price is delivered and how to read the bias on an intraday basis a daily basis and hopefully over a short-term period of time you can find setups that repeat and they have common characteristics that are very similar but they won't be identical no no they won't be carbon copies but you'll see similarities that to know and trust that this is a setup that you are familiar with okay and because you were all being viewed as yearners okay you are all yearning to learn how to do this there's three stages in this youtube mentorship okay i'm treating you all as green horns okay you're just yearning to do this a lot of you that begin this youtube mentorship will not complete it because you're gonna get frustrated because you want something else or a alternative a way of me teaching it to you i'm not going to take suggestions from anybody on how to teach it differently this is the way i'm going to teach it so it's as is it will not be setups given to you for trades but i will take your attention before the fact and draw them out on a chart where i want you to study where price will likely draw to next and using the things i teach you conceptually it's your job to study that okay do not look at that as a trade setup do not look at that as a enticement to take a live trade so it's my intentions to take the yearners that want to learn how to do this through a process of becoming structured learners so you're going from yearning to learning and hopefully at your discretion and timing you'll become an earner okay so learner earner okay so those three stages are what i'm going to take you through it's not going to be an entire year mentorship i'm going to do probably three or four months but before we get into it i want you to know that i will not be providing any content to the youtube channel or my own personal mentorship during the month of march okay so march 2022 i will not be doing anything i'll be on vacation and we're gonna be doing several road trips so i will not be working for you okay so if you can accept that then i think over the next coming months it should be rather entertaining and interesting for you as a student so you're looking at this screen here and one of the things i promised i would do in 2022 is to show you how some of these concepts would work in an environment outside of a demo account i've always used the moniker demo baller because that's my name i gave myself that to kind of like champion the idea that i'm teaching through a demo but if i can teach you through a demo and things are repeating you can see your charts okay whether it's a live platform or if it's a demo you're seeing the things that i teach and if you've been fortunate enough to be in my presence when i'm calling it beforehand it's very rewarding and you all on youtube will have those experiences as well but the main thing is for you not to grow a dependency on me pointing to everything before it happens because if you do that or if you have that mindset going in it's going to stunt your growth and in fact it's going to create a barrier for you because it'll create a codependency state of mind and i don't want that i try to foster a independent mindset where you're independently coming to the decisions on your own it's that way the results are yours if it's success you own it if you failed you own that too i can't co-sign for your failure and some of you absolutely will fail i said this many times openly and every time i've been asked in 2016 i started a paid mentorship and i have students from that time period that are still trying to find their way and they cannot make these things work for themselves i have other students from 2016 that are absolutely mind-blowing results and i have students from my mentorship group that was the final class in 2021 i'm not taking new enrollment so don't ask that group i have traders that are doing very well as well so it's not a shortcoming on what it is they're being taught it's just an individual unique experience that you have to grow and go through and i can't speed it up for you any more than i already done so i'm optimistic but i'm a realist i know some of you simply will not do the things i ask you to do you will not do them effectively and you'll try to short cut certain things and you'll think that you don't need to do this and don't do that and your results will be reduced because of that so if i suggest things to you drills homework things to study do your best to participate in that okay and even if you can't do it live you know there's other ways to go through and look at it it's not the same as seeing it live but it's the best you can do because some of you have businesses some of you have school jobs okay let's be real and you may have family things that keep you also from being able to watch live data in the times i'm asking you to do it i'm not going to jump through hoops i'm not going to do acrobatics to make it you know feasible for every single one of you okay it's unrealistic for you any of you to have that expectation of me because i don't need to be doing this i love doing it i'm looking forward to doing it but i want to make sure all of you have the right mindset okay so in 2022 i promised that you would see how these concepts work in an environment outside of a demo account and what would that mean well it would mean not well not an mt4 platform because years ago it's been shown how frauds and fakes can use that platform to pretend that they're profitable that they can find setups and that their trading is amazing and they can go in and edit their trades after the fact after the market's already moved well i've already proven that i don't do those types of things and i went to tradingview and that was the platform that i asked my community so which which platform should i use if i'm going away from mt4 i want to go to a platform that's reputable so i teach and you'll see me teaching through tradingview so that's the medium that we use it's familiar to me because i'm teaching mentorship students through that but if that's not your platform of choice you're just going to have to get used to me teaching through that medium because i'm not going to do something in addition to okay but for a live account i felt that td ameritrade is very reputable and that it is regulated by the commodity futures trading commission and all of the other gardening bodies uh i cannot rig this to make it look like i'm smarter okay i can't go back in and change a trade i can't fix it okay i can't add lipstick to it okay it either is or isn't a profitable trade okay it's as simple as that td ameritrade uses the margins that are accepted and established in the industry and some of you may not be able to trade a market because of margin don't let that be a hindrance i'll show you how to work around that in other platforms while i don't personally use an mt4 account for teachings or or trading live funds or anything like that i'm confident that students that are trying to learn how to do this they can still use mt4 or mt5 or any other platform for that matter i as an educator though moved away from those platforms because they can be gained okay in other words they can be used to fraud and fake results okay so in treating you you've seen examples after examples of me going in recording an entry calling the moves as it happens without the replay button because replay doesn't let you do trade entries okay and replay only shows you a completed candlestick it doesn't show you the generation of the open all the price action up and down to the close of every individual candlestick so i've had a lot of folks over the years asked me to show live account show live account show live account and one of the things that kept me from wanting to do is because if i show results of any kind right away and this is how i viewed it too as a developing student in the 1990s that made me feel like i'm never going to get it because their results were way above what i could do as a learning developing student i had no idea what i was doing in 1992 but to see people say yeah i made fifty thousand dollars in the soybean market okay or i made eighty thousand dollars in coffee well that to me was a very huge mountain decline like i have to do that it just it felt impossible but i also didn't want to give results that were so low end that it didn't inspire an interest in having people want to learn it so because this business is extremely unique and personal it's both the easiest thing you'll ever do and sometimes for many of you is the most impossible thing to be successful at and that sounds like an oxymoron it sounds like double talk and it is but it isn't how's that for a rib you can't appreciate how difficult it is until you start treating life funds but before you start treatment life funds in your in the consistently quote unquote profitable demo trading stage you feel like you can do anything but something magical happens when you go into a live account where now suddenly every little tick means something to you because it means success or failure on an individual basis whereas if you lose in a demo account yeah you didn't really lose anything you can take another demo trade but with live account trading you have to deal with that drawdown in that loss and making money in an account is sometimes worse than losing money because it will make you feel like you want another taste of that and it creates opportunities for you to go into over trade and or over leverage and both of those things we'll talk about in the youtube mentorship how to avoid some of those things but it's up to you to avoid them okay and it takes a lot of ownership personally and the responsibility that is required to do this is paramount okay you cannot have anybody else take responsibility for your actions it's your actions and if you do well you earned it if you don't do well you hate you have to eat it okay it's the way it is and too many people are weak-minded in this world that they will never become successful traders no matter who teaches them what whatever thing they use they're gonna be a failure okay that's just the way it is and there's no way around that i can't fix and improve everyone's shortcomings i have my own personal issues that i fight and wrestle with internally and it's not easy like i'm obsessively compulsive and i have i have adv it's all these things okay that make it difficult for me and i'm bipolar so i have a lot of mental barriers but if i can sit down and frame out an idea that repeats at least once a week i'm confident that those individuals out there that are like me or without these barriers can do it as well that's my personal belief it doesn't make it fact it doesn't make it true it just means that's my belief and i've seen case studies in my own students where that's true it's a transferable skill but the skill must be honed by you the student so anyway i promised i would show some results in 2022 outside of a demo account so i used td ameritrade but years ago i was asked to show a regulated broker non-mt4 and i felt that td ameritrade was a better choice outside of you know the standard forex account brokers because with td ameritrade you can trade forex you can trade futures you can trade commodities stocks options you can bond up everything out there you can treat it okay so eventually over time if you do become successful when you're profitable you want to go with a broker that allows you to have access to all those vehicles because there's certain times of the year certain asset classes just aren't going to do very well but others will in this type of broker and i'm not repping td ameritrade i don't get anything for it i'm not an introducing broker i'm just saying that when i'm showing results in an account that is not demo this is the broker that i deposited funds with so that way we know what i'm saying here i'm not telling you to go here and trade okay i have only traded a few trades with this broker but i can tell you their fills are immediate their confirmations are solid i haven't had any problems technically it's just i'm fumbling with the layouts the way things are made available to me because it's just like anything else when i'm transitioned from mt4 teaching from that being very comfortable that going into treating view it's very cumbersome and i'm still clumsy with it when i'm teaching and i'm finding it a little bit cumbersome here as well because i just don't know where they have certain things i don't know how to make the charts scalable as faces i want them to be and like i'm used to doing it with tradestation or tradingview or mt4 so it's just a learning process but it doesn't change the fact that if you know how to trade then the trades are easy so i keep everything very simple you know i use limits and markets to get in and i just collapse a trade when it gets to a target of my choice so that's all i'm showing you here today it's just to show you that the things i'm going to be showing you are applicable on paper and in demo and the same logic is used here and while this is not a lot of money it's only twenty three thousand was it six hundred ninety four dollars and eleven cents it's not something to brag about let's just put it that way but it's something that's not demo it's something that won't stay at that level and my objective is to teach conceptually a hypothetical income based strategy okay it's not a trying to beat the world cup okay it's not trying to do better than every instagram trader out there it's just trying to teach how someone can take another opportunity and hopefully in the best case scenario and i can't guarantee or promise it to you but i'm going to certainly do my best to do what i know and how i can teach it so that way you can be at least inspired to make an attempt to try okay and because i believe that things are about to get really really hard for everyone financially and without going into great detail just look around the world and you know what i'm talking about but this is the e-mini s p march delivery contract for 2022 okay and it's a two minute chart and i want you to see the port of entry here this is a short it took and the cover was here and another one here a small little scalp and then here and then over here i'm showing you so that way you can see there was no other trades after that short or two shorts rather and then today i slept in and i just want to have something in addition to what i already have here this is kind of like one of the setups that you're going to learn in the mentorship where the entries here and exits here okay not a lot of handles okay handle would be like 45 67 to 45 68. so that's four ticks or one full handle in this market it's 50 per handle or per four ticks so every one tick is twelve dollars and fifty cents above this high is buy stops and i was targeting that here running into that okay so very very simple strategy optimal trade entry you don't need to get in at this level here okay i'm going to teach you how to have forgiving entries you don't need to be highly precise about your entries but you need to be precise about the directional bias and where it's going okay where's price reaching for and that's kind of like what i'm showing you in this mentorship on the youtube channel so if i have at least given you the opportunity to find setups conceptually if that's the case then over time if you submit yourself to it you'll find more setups than you'd ever imagine because they're there a lot in excess of these lower time frames so in a nutshell what am i saying here i'm saying that if you can learn how to take 25 handles okay if you can take 25 handles out of a market like the e-mini s p you may not have the margin 12 13 000 or whatever it is to trade one contract of this market you don't need to have that you can trade the micros and while you're not making fifty dollars per handle on e-mini s p you're making five dollars per handle you can still graduate over time and build that up and it's not a lot of initial margin that's required to do that or if you're outside the u.s you can trade a cfd and trade the u.s 500 market through like an mt4 account and again i'm just going to touch on that i'm not suggesting that you should especially those individuals in the states because it's actually illegal for you to trade that because it doesn't go through a regulated extreme exchange like a futures market would so that makes it illegal for us traders to do that so we have to in the u.s trade through the futures market and they have been nice enough to provide micro accounts for vehicles like the e-mini s p and the nasdaq they have micro accounts so whatever the multiplier would be on the regular mini it's just reduced to a smaller level in terms of margin and tick value and i'll cover all that stuff it's i've made it very very simple or at least that's been the goal i'm having going into this i'll make it very very simple for all of you to look at it say okay i don't have to have a thousand moving parts i can go in and simply look at things that make sense and if you can visually understand what it is i'm teaching you'll see that it doesn't require a lot of chart graffiti okay things that are very distracting do you look at this chart here and see a lot of things that would be mysterious no very simple little things i'll draw a line to highlight a level that i want to see breached okay and a level where i want to see it reach up into and that's the basis of understanding how the markets work within a liquidity matrix you have buy side and sell side and once you have that understanding and i'll teach some of those things in the mentorship you'll be able to find setups that repeat at least one good setup a week but if you can find 25 handles a week in the e-mini market you can do very very well with that very very well you don't need to hit home runs and here's my inspiration to you in closing if we're looking at a market that provides uh setups and let's just say your mortgage or your rent is say 1500 it may not be that much it may be actually more than that i'm just going to say let's say it's 1500 what happens if you can earn enough to make 50 or all of that a month going forward would that not be beneficial to you that's the mindset i want you all to have or let's say you have a car mode in your car payment and your car insurance if you could find a way to have that money come to you by your own speculation over time not right away i'm not suggesting all of you are going to do this in the same year but over time if you submit to the process i outlined for you my belief is my personal belief my honest opinion is i believe that it is possible now anyone can say oh anything's possible but i believe the things i'm going to show you are things that you'll be able to spot on your own now i'm going to coach you throughout the coming months showing you where certain things may deliver but i don't want you to feel like you need that so i'll teach you how to anticipate certain things on your own and then you check yourself with the things i reveal or do a review with and my belief is that you'll be better at reading price when i'm done doing this youtube internship and again i don't think i'm going to be doing more than four months and that four months is actually including the month of march where nothing nothing's getting uploaded nothing in my private mentorship or on youtube so i will be vacationing that entire month so i'll be doing those things during the month of march and then in april i'll return back to the mentor that i am in my private mentorship and i'll return back to the delivery of the lessons on the youtube channel so what does this schedule look like for this mentorship on youtube obviously friday will be your first episode and then it'll be a tuesday and thursday upload there will be assignments and pdf files provided for your learning throughout the week i'm not promising any specific schedule on that but you'll be able to see them if you go to my community tab i'll provide a way for you to get to the information and download it and i think that if you submit to this you'll be far better than you are right now about reading price expecting certain things to deliver and you'll find that it's not as challenging when you have a good mentor and you have sound logic and it's not over complicated and that's my goal going in and until talk to you on friday be safe

all right folks well we're here so technically this is the first teaching uh I gave you guys an in introduction video obviously if you haven't watched that one yet go to the playlist on my YouTube channel and please watch that one because it'll help at least establish the in my opinion the proper expectations that way you understand what you're getting involved with here and at least it gives me a chance to kind of like break the ice and show you the contrast of what you may be expecting versus what I intend to deliver all right so this first installment is going to be elements to a trade setup all right so coming out of the gate I just want to let you know this is predominantly going to be a Futures index trading mentorship okay the idea is going to be presented in the scope of paper trading on tradingview.com but what you're looking at here this is thinker swims live data these are actual executions I made today and I want you to compare and contrast with what you see on YouTube and other educat where they'll tout that they can do this and they can do that but really I want you to compare and contrast what you see here all right so we're looking at intraday price action for Nasdaq e- mini Futures and this is actually uh the the main focus of this mentorship okay um I believe that this Market is worth studying I believe it is not just limited to NASDAQ but I believe it's useful to learn as a Trader that views obviously the e- mini S&P the e- mini Dow future and the e- mini NASDAQ now e- mini NASDAQ is a little bit faster a little bit more aggressive and even with that you can still trade it so I want you to think about what it means to watch price action and understand what it's likely to do before it does it now I'm not promising you're going to be able to do that right out of the gate what I'm going to show you is the compare and contrast to how I can trade versus what I'm promising to teach you in this mentorship how to find specific setups in your demo account okay or your paper trading account I'm not trying to entice you to trade with live funds okay so that way we know this going in the teachings will be predominantly through the school scope of tradingview.com paper trading module or just hindsight data now I already know some of you are oh here we go the hindsight guy well what you're looking at here is actually live executions from today okay and I want you to think about if you were able to trade a micro account and you were trading the Naas deck and you were able to capture just one of these moves which one would you like to learn how to find obviously you probably look at this and think well I'd like to do all of them but I want you to think about which one really stands out off the entire chart and this is a one minute chart which one really stands out I'll give you a moment you can pause the video and unpause it when you're ready some of you folks never ever pause it all right so obviously we can see how the Market moves from here okay two orders executed here whenever you see this this is actually a reversal so if there is a trade on long it'll reverse and take you the other direction okay and then this one here this is a reversal as well then another another close and then another long entry the exit a short entry and then the cover okay I'd like for you to consider what it would take for you to find consistency and how many handles how many full handle moves in an index Futures Contract that would satisfy you and when I say a handle that's essentially four ticks the minimum fluctuation in these markets an example would be if you were trading the EM S&P and you were trading obviously the 4450 level and you went long if it went to 4451 that's a full handle okay or four ticks or four * $12.50 or $50 per handle the nas deck is $20 per handle so it's slightly different but it's faster it moves a lot more lot more handles a lot more aggression now it doesn't always move faster sometimes we'll have a lethargic price action in this Indy or another out of the three that would be the S&P the NASDAQ and the Dow I personally don't trade the Dow that much but there's a lot of my students that love trading the ym but ym is the symbol for the Futures Contract and these three markets have the luxury for you that may not have the capability to put up to like $177,000 margin if you were going to trade one full contract of the NASDAQ futures most Brokers unless you're using a discount broker they're going to require you to have Deep Pockets and sense that you're going to have that about $177,000 and about 12,000 and a half for an e- Min S&P for Futures Contract okay you take basically a fraction of that and you can trade a micro on each one of these markets but obviously it reduces the number of the tick multiplier because you're trading with a lot less technically leverage so I'm going to get into all that but I just kind of like want to begin the conversation informally but also to kind of like show you what it is that I do versus what other people do okay so I'm not trying to you know point my finger at anyone in particular but if you look around on YouTube there are people out there that try to make a big stink about themselves and they'll try to show results that may or may not be real I'm not here to disparage that they could be actually trading a live account I don't personally care but anyone that trades on think or Swim they can recognize this chart right away I posted a results and updated uh reflection on the Thinker swim or TDM a trade account and it's on my community tab I promise I won't beat you up too much with the community tab but that's my way of reaching out to you so if you subscribe to the channel and then when you subscribe to the channel you want to toggle all notifications you want to click that little uh I think it's like a bell icon and then all notifications that way anytime I post my community tab it'll let you know otherwise it won't let you know so it's it's my replacement to Twitter which in my opinion sucks so if we look at the EB and flow of all this here where the Market's trading up and between here and here it's not a small number of handles it's a pretty respectful amount of handles it's not a couple it's not a handful and then up here it's a reversal and it comes back down and I buy it back here in Reverse so I'm selling short here and I'm buying long here 740 the 720 that's 20 handles going long here at 720 I'm abbreviating the number just for brevity sake getting out at 732 12 handles then going along here 756 and then getting out at 784 A2 then going short at 798 and covering at 675 so I'll ask you which one of these trades do you think is the one that you want to learn again putting all aside the idea that you you probably want to do all of these but I'm not promising you that okay I'm going to take you into how to find this setup here notice the number of handles I'm not promising you're going to get this many handles but the setups and the logic behind it will help you find these types of Frameworks framework is the foundation to a trading model so you have to have an understanding what is you're looking for and that's really the only thing I'm introducing tonight is the idea of what it is I'm promising to educate you with so that way you can go in and find these setups on your own you will not need to be a slave to some kind of blackbox system you don't need to be a part of some kind of signal generating gimmick you don't need to be a part of a signal service you can find these on your own independent that's exactly what I'm trying to frame in all of my students I do that with my mentorship students that paid me for education now here you are in my YouTube channel I'm telling you the same thing I'm teaching Independence that way you're not requiring any handholding by me once you understand the rules and you go through the processes and things I'm going to teach you how to practice with you will not need anything except for the chart itself that's it and that's how in my opinion and you can argue with this if you want but I could care less if you could any of you would challenge the idea that independent thinking is not the best way of doing it you want to be able to be Unshackled okay and if you're part of a signal service or if you're part of a approach that requires you to use a blackbox system you're kind of held captive aren't you so if you look at this this chart is clean except for these little bubbles actually show you the transactions you don't really get any kind of well distortion from your reading of price action I don't have a lot of graffiti on the chart okay but the main takeaway here is I want you to understand that I don't hunt for three to five handles and consider that legendary okay now can you be profitable if you take high frequency trades and you do those types of Trades absolutely that's what Algos do algorithms do that but I'm trying to show you by contrast that there is a way that you can find setups that are outside that parameter of very small little handles and doing lots of contracts so if you're looking at this here and this was say you're trading and you're trading a NASDAQ micro account you're not making a lot of money on these swings okay I'm not making a lot of money on these swings but I'm able to find these swings and it's not these small little increments okay I'm going to teach you skill sets that Focus primary arily on this okay you want to find a nice price leg intraday I'm not promising you how to buy sell short Buy sell short Buy sell short that's that's mine okay I'm not teaching that and I somebody like oh you're a jerk you're this you're that whatever I didn't promise that that's why I set the stage in the first introduction video so that way we know what it is I'm teaching you if anyone of you here don't want to learn how to take this type of trade you're welcome to not continue and turn this video off and go watch whoever okay but I think if you give it a chance you'll find some amazing things that bring Clarity to reading price action all right so we're looking at the NASDAQ futures March delivery contract and this is a trading view chart and if you've never used tradingview.com the way you would pull this symbol up is NQ h222 okay and and this is a weekly chart and I want you to think about each week before the new trading week begins preferably on the weekend okay the idea is you want to try to get a read on what you think that next weekly candle is going to do is it going to go higher or is it going to go lower you're not trying to predict the close of the weekly candle that's important okay you just want to see before this weekly candle opened up all we had was this IND candle okay do you think that this candle that would have formed and opened here is more likely to go higher or lower obviously with the benefit of hindsight here but I can tell you all of my students know we've been looking for lower prices and I'll just give you a quick short list as the reasons why number one seasonality okay seasonal Tendencies it tends to go down around this time anyway we also have discussions about how the fed's going to raise interest rates stock market does not like that we're also in earnings season there's a lot of volatility because of earnings and those factors plus the underlying tone of the marketplace which I'll show you when we get into the daily chart it just well it's heavy and this is where it was going to draw to okay did I expect this entire range to be delivered in one week no that's not important the point is I'm expecting the weekly candle to expand on the lower end okay okay or go down and gravitate towards this low which it hasn't broken yet but I think that's what we're probably going to aim for on Sunday's opening going into Monday's trading so that's where I think it's drawing to and that's the component I want you to focus on with your analysis what is the market likely to draw to when I say draw to think of it as price being a paperclip okay and then you you have this magnetic impulse that specifically price levels and seasonality okay will put on price it'll cause price to gravitate towards certain levels and the measure of speed and magnitude that it moves to get to these levels you learn that over experience that's not something I can transfer it's something you have to practice and see and study and you get a rhythm for it okay every educator knows what I mean by that and every student that's been trained successfully by any other educator will not understand exactly what I mean by that you just get a feel for it it's experience there's no way of defining outside of that in the early stages of your development you want to at least try to focus your attention on where that Weekly candle is going to do now here's the thing it may start the first half of the week or maybe just one day expand lower and if you get a setup in that that's it you're done that's how you start working towards consistency no student ever should try to trade every single session every single day because the only thing you're doing is building an expectation that you're going to be able to do this every single day profitably and then if you do get a run of profitability soon as you get a losing trade it's going to blow your mind and you're going to want to correct it quickly and you're going to start making irrational decisions and then you enter that loser cycle I've talked about many times in the YouTube channel so the only thing you're looking for is a likely movement higher or lower based on on the weekly candle okay that's all you're doing that sets your initial bias for the week on the daily chart you're looking for swing highs and swing lows to get your liquidity and majority of your trading and the draw on liquidity what makes the market go higher or lower it's predominantly found on this time frame okay so majority of your analysis should really be linked to this time frame right here you have to have an assumption whether you're going to be expecting that Weekly candle to expand higher or lower that's your weekly bi but then you have to go into the daily chart and figure out basically where you are in the grand scheme of things on that Weekly range expanding higher or lower because we're looking for lower prices and we're looking for weakness the expectation is we want to see every short-term low like this would be a shortterm low this will be a short-term low and underneath those lows there's going to be sell stops okay that's liquidity when I say learn to start looking for where the Market's going to draw to it's drawing to one of two things okay it's drawing to stops which is liquidity or it's running to an imbalance now what's that mean above old highs buy stops below old lows sell stops imbalances is something like this over here where we have one single candle pass higher and the previous candle's high is here and the next candle's low is here so it only went up one candle nothing moved down the overlap with that same delivery on that price candle there so in other words that's an imbalance it's only going higher and nothing else is here to offset that and efficiently deliver price on the opposite end now you probably heard of the theory auction Theory okay and folks hear me try to communicate some of these things and they'll run away with oh he's just talking about auction Theory and it's not just like when they see me do a rectangle or a box on chart and you'll see one in this video it's not supply and demand okay it's just what it is you'll see it and you'll know right away after you've been with me for a couple weeks that this is entirely unique and there's nothing else like it and I'm certain majority of you are going to fall in love with this model so we're looking for lower prices we're looking for an expansion I'm using the benefit of hindsight but I can promise you again this was discussed we were looking for lower prices in my paid group and if I did not say that I have a lot of students that are making YouTube channels they are welcome to come out and say I'm a liar so we're looking at the daily chart we're going to drop down into the hourly chart okay now what I have here is a framework for looking at the weekly range on an hourly chart so all I did was beginning on midnight New York time Monday's candle and then Friday's close and in the beginning of Friday's trading at midnight okay now what I'm delineating here is the fact that we had a nice selloff on Thursday and the market went into consolidation overnight notice what happens here on Friday this is that old low in the daily chart that's what we're thinking or assuming that it's going to draw to because that daily chart there's lots of liquidity and large fund Traders large institutional Traders institutional mindset investors will be looking at these old lows and old highs and liquidity providers will be looking to take business in around these same levels so if we know that this level down here is the old daily low and again let me take it back up to the chart on the daily chart that's this low right here okay by dropping down into the hourly chart at levels here all I'm doing is transposing those daily levels right to this hourly chart the entire week has been bearish okay it's been going lower since the beginning then we had consolidation in here the market creates this short-term high in this short-term low what rests above that short-term high if you've taken notes and been paying attention it's buy stops what's resting below this low Here Sell stops watch closely the market trades down initially and takes out the cell stops why would it do that first this is inducing shorts okay so it Engineers liquidity even if the idea is that they want to take the market down to this level if it's been consolidating I like to see them do this type of move here where it drops down first it's kind of like a sucker play anybody has a sell stop below here they want to sell on weakness they're going to get tripped into the marketplace so now they're triggered in short and then they start doing a run against those Traders and against those that were already short from this high so what are they doing the Market's being driven higher and the algorithms going to attack that buy stock liquidity pool why would they want to do that number one it's going to punish those individuals here that went short when it drives Above This High here it sends all those spy stops into Market orders flooding the marketplace that gives a huge influx of willing buyers at a high price which is the perfect counterparty to Smart money that wants to sell at a high price remember the market wants to go down here so when it dries up to here those buy stops are the counterparty or the other side of a smart money Trader that's wanting to go short because they're going to sell short they got to sell it to somebody wants to buy it at a high price that's why the market does this okay in your notes you want to record anytime a significant price move lower is expected always anticipate some measure of a stop hunt on buy stops or a short-term High being taken out obviously it's reversed when you're looking for higher prices generally you'll see a shortterm low taken out and sell stops taken before you see a very pronounced rally High higher don't take my word for it go through your charts and you'll see it's actually occurring almost on a daily basis so we're going to drop down into a 15-minute time frame so that same old low level down here and that high I just mentioned on the hourly chart and the low on the hourly chart is now been defined with a small little line segment okay so we have a trend line here and a trend line here that's the extent of a trend line that's it I only use them to highlight to my students these levels are not on my chart I'm watching a naked chart okay you while you're developing you should have these levels drawn out in your chart because it helps you build and ingrain the idea that this is where liquidity is it keeps you focused on that because it's easy to look at all these candles forming if you have the luxury of watching it in life and you can lose sight of where you are and mean once you lose your bearings it's really confusing and this helps you keep those bearings in mind and what do I mean by that well I mentioned how the market dropped down initially and that takes the sell stops out so sell side liquidity has been attacked Traders are now tripped in going short if they sold on a break trying to be a breakout artist and then the algorithms go right back up to an area where it's been cleanly delivered relative equal highs see how this High here right before it dropped is basically the same high here notice that so retail Traders see this and they trust it as what resistance so the books always say put your buy stop if you're going to go short right above and clear level of resistance well these levels work for a short period of time but majority of the time you see this event right here and this is how I teach my students to go in there and look for those types of events because what did I just tell you a moments ago about looking for significant price moves before there's a significant price move of any real magnitude or importance generally there's going to be a hunt that takes place right before that price delivery occurs so what does it look like you have relative equal highs this high and this High the market goes up when we're what we're expecting lower prices on that Weekly chart we're on the last day of the week it's already been heavy it's weak and the only thing it's been doing is consolidate and the first thing it did was broke out to the downside tripping what traders in a breakout to go short so now they have Traders caught on the wrong side offs side and now they want to take the market up here where those buy stops are going to be resting for those that were smart enough to sell short here or here and didn't get out below here so the larger pool of liquidity is going to be resting here because it's in sync with the downtrend and everybody that was short the day before they seen this High form and once it broke below this low here they all rushed and Trail their stop loss right above that and I understand if you're new and you think well this is easy to explain in hindsight but I want to remind you go back and look at the first slide I showed you those were actual entries that's a live account through thinker swim Charles swab that was the clearing firm that did the broker side of the business okay so I'm not showing you a demo account I'm not showing you paper trading that those were real entries okay they were real reversals the whole business but the main thing was I showed you that larger trade this is going to be the framework that I'm teaching you how to find it okay but this pool of liquidity once this occurs you want to drop down to your lower time frames and start looking for something specific and let's go into those lower time frames and find out what that is okay here's a two-minute chart why a two-minute chart well 2 minute 1 minute or 3 minute or five five minutes still has a lot of room for imbalances to occur underneath that time frame and what do I mean by that the one minute 2 minute 3 minute chart tends to be the best for finding the imbalances for indices okay don't take my word for that okay if you're looking for high frequency setups intraday the one two or 3 minute chart are just beautiful they just offer a real good Clarity the reason why because the high frequency trading algorithms are operating on nothing really higher than 3 minutes majority of the time they're like seconds okay 15c 30 second 45 second 60c intervals okay and what they're looking for are these small little imbalances and what does that look like well we have that run on the buy stops here okay remember that old high here the old high here old high here it runs right on through that once this occurs on that higher time frame 15-minute time frame you want to drop down to the lower time frames and I'm using the two-minute chart because this is exactly what I was using to find that imbalance and trade off of it okay the market creates a short-term low here here and then it breaks below that this is key this is called a break in Market structure now the foundations and underlying framework is we're in a market that's what weekly bearish we're expecting that Weekly candle to expand lower it's been expanding all week so we have momentum on our side we have a consolidation that's occurred and we had a pull liquidity engineered with these relative equal highs and the market broke out to the downside first and then they ran on the highs so once it went here we don't rush in there just go short because it went above old highs we're looking for some specific signature that tips its hand to you okay and I promise you when you start going through your charts and it's going to be homework for you you're going to see this occurring almost every single day and if it's not doing it this way it's doing it the opposite direction as a buy okay again don't take my word for it you're going to be flabbergasted you like that flabbergasted when you see how many times this thing forms every single week okay it's many times throughout the intraday charts it creates this type of move but it runs the stops then we have a short-term low and then it breaks below it so now we have a Breakin Market structure okay once this low is broken you're going to look for this little area here that's that imbalance I mentioned in the beginning right so what's happening is the Market's going to go right up inside that area there and that's where you want to sell now if you don't sell there you can drop down to a lower time frame one minute chart if this was a 3 minute chart you can go down to a one minute chart and look for that to occur on that time frame as well and it many times will form if you're looking at a lower time frame like say this was a 5-minute chart and you looked at a one minute chart you'd find one down in here it's a matter of scaling down in your time frames because once you have an underlying premise to the market now likely to go lower it becomes an easy thing to look for these types of things so in your chart once you're developing this idea and and learning it you're going to highlight this candle's low this candle's high and this right here is what I teach my students as a fair value Gap okay you don't have those in books okay you don't have any of that kind of stuff out there it's something I introduced back in 2016 and obviously a lot of people discovered how good it is and they try to make courses with it but I'm going to not touch that right here but the idea is once it go up into that imbalance there and once it does that soon as it enters that area the algorithm that delivers price now some of you may not know what that means and some of you may not even agree with it you may think that this is made up or it's contrived I promise you if you spend time with this you're going to quickly come to the conclusion that there absolutely is an algorithm and it's manipulating the markets every single day every single tick it's completely controlled okay period you're led to believe it's buying and selling pressure now if I go back and use that analogy where it went down here first then go up here some of you may argue see that's the buying and selling pressure no it's not it's liquidity now you may argue and say well we're arguing semantics no I'm telling you what's going on this is the logic this is how these markets book okay once you see these patterns over and over and over again it's very easy to execute on them but the impulse to want to do it the first time you see it because you watch this video that is going to be problematic for you so you're going to have to do a certain number of weeks and months of back testing there's no escaping that you have to do it any skill set any teacher educator system whatever okay whatever they're going to give you there's going to be some kind of growing period where you have to trial and error fix the problems that you have about yourself and I've literally taken your attention to a very specific framework and setup notice that some of you may think I'm still talking too much but I'm taking you right into the heart of the matter this is what it looks like this is what you're looking for okay these are the Fingerprints of that setup these repeat so if you know what they are and what those components are that make up this setup you'll be able to find them but focus on the imbalance after the market structure breaks so this big candle here it breaks down look at the next candle it opens and trades higher and stops right there so from this candle's low and this candle's High when this candle starts trading soon as it opens and it runs right up into that that's a short you can go right in there and sell short be done now where's your stock going to be well you can put it above this High here or you can put it above this candle's High whichever your risk parameters allow for okay um if you're trading the micro which is again it's not a lot of money per tip so the multiplier for that is very very small if you trade the larger full Futures cont cont and if it moves 100 points and it can do it real quick it can burn you pretty bad so you may have the leverage to trade with a discount broker okay you may have the initial margin to trade with a discount broker but you may not have the wherewithal and the skill set to navigate this market and that's the only thing I'm trying to provide here as an alternative because there's a lot of individuals outs there that will promote the idea that you can go out there with a discount broker and just clean up yeah if you know what you're doing but you don't need a discount broker to be profitable okay looking at this further we're going to look at the logic in here and I want you to think about after this forms and you see that as your choice setup or entry if it starts to move lower you can still get in it there's no reason not to think that you know you can't get in it here or in here it's close to or in close proximity to where that area is as an entry once we take out a low though once that occurs then it becomes a matter of your chasing price and if you try to get in especially if you like using Market order you may see it trade right to this low and say okay now I believe it's going to go down you put a market order in the sell short then slippage gets you down here that creates a larger area of risk that you have to assume and it's just it's problematic you want to learn to trust going short when the Market's going higher and that feels scary at first but once you start seeing this pattern form it becomes easy to trust it and in in fact that you want to be doing that you want to be selling short expecting lower prices right when the candle's going up and Retail Traders can't grasp that many times it's just like it goes against the logic because they think I got to have confirmation all the books say I have to have confirmation and that's somebody that's coming in late that's someone that doesn't have a read price they can't really follow it and usually they're the people that will trade short with additional shell you know sell stops they'll put sell stops below the marketplace and then that's a momentum entry for them and it's kind of like a no-brainer in fast markets it yeah it works but if you don't know what you're doing you try to do that in a market that's consolidating or about the reverse it hands you your backside okay so if you're looking at this framework here and we've taken the buy stots we have our entry pattern here what would you be looking for as a downside objective well I'm going to teach you the liquidity Matrix okay and sounds pretty cool sounds neat and all that but watch what it is this here is your range this is the low of the day and this is the high of the day thus far so if we take that range and split it from the low to the high to get the midpoint all this can be determined by a simple 50 level on a Fibonacci so you drag your Fib from this high down to that low or vice versa and have your 50 level highlighted then anything above that 50 level this is referred to from an algorithmic stance as a premium Market it means is expensive now markets can stay in a premium for a while and not go to a discount which would be below the 50 point okay 50% anything down here is a discount if you're bearish if you're ever going short you want to look at the previous range where are you at inside that range so when this formed here that little fair value Gap once that formed you're thinking okay we are in a premium so algorithms will want want to go to a discount that's the opposing side of the marketplace so if it's going short here it's driving the market lower what does that mean the algorithm is going to start pricing lower you can have all the buyers in the world come in if the algorithm is in a sell program and it's going lower it does not matter it's going to repic lower and lower and lower and then what will happen is those buyers that may come in with a huge influx of volume they're going to get crushed and they get squeezed you ever hear that term oh this is a bear squeeze this is a bull squeeze all that is an excuse for them not to know why the algorithm is doing what it's doing that's it that's all it is it's an out okay I'm telling you this is what's really going on so the Market's moving from this premium high this specific entry point to a level below the 50 of this range this low and this high now I want you to again go back and Rewind the video once we're done and look at that execution page where I showed you my entries going back and forth up and down up and down and where I got out at where I got in at okay I want you to think about what below this level here the 50 level what is resting below here cell stops so now think about the idea of Someone Like You and I that would see this ideal entry as a short we have to sell to get in that short how do we get out of that short we got to buy it back or cover it by buying well we're going to find willing sellers at a low price relative to this point here they're willing already sitting down there with their sell stops right below that low now look closely what else resides right near that low do you see it pause the video before I show it to you because it kind of ruins the experience because if you find it and I don't tell it it feels good right there is that imbalance I mentioned okay it's only one single candle passing up and the previous candle's High and the next candle's low that area right there is an imbalance from this area here it went down below the 50 level and attacked these cell stops and completely closed in this imbalance so every point of this candle's High to this candle's low that range with the candle only going up that's a by side imbalance it has to have an equal delivery to be efficiently priced and booked by the algorithm it goes down and completely closes it back in with down movement notice the candle on this here it opens and then trades down so it fulfills its role of balancing the buy side offering now the sells side offering so that is an efficiently delivered price move Precision elements from the entry here down to here everything else after that for the rest of the day I didn't care about even though I had an objective of that old daily low I wasn't expecting it to run into it this particular day and that's why I didn't participate anymore the rest of the day in hindsight I wish I would have left a small position on and just let it go but you're going to have that you're never going to be right about everything all the time every single day you're going to leave things on the table you're going to get in too early you're going to hold too long you're not going to buy enough you're not going to sell enough there's always going to be some reasons why you didn't do something right so don't beat yourself up about it okay but if you can find elements like this repeat in the price action can you agree with me that that is amazing precision and this is the logic I used to do that trade the very trade that I showed you that was the largest one in the example of saying which one would you rather learn how to do I basically just handed you an ATM machine okay this repeats every single week every single week now I want you to count the number of the Handles in this move let's say you got in at uh well this say you got in at 800 14,800 it started to go down you trust it okay we're going to go short ideally you want to enter as it goes into that but it's going to take time for you to trust that but let's say you got in at 14,800 if you got out down here like I did I exited as it went right to the top of that range right here this range here that's the top of it once went below that that was it for me that closed the trade is that five handles is that 10 handles is that 20 handles is that 30 handles is that 50 handles no it's over 100 and something now let's assume for a moment that you get good at this or I get the inclination that I want to go to some kind of a deep discount broker and I go in I do trades like this and I'm putting on 15 to 25 full Futures contracts what do you think the results are going to be yep so not everything is going to be easy right away and you're not going to be able to see these things happen just because you sit in front of the charts you have to study and you have to practice and by experience of looking at Old moves and watching real price action as best as you can if you can't watch it live trading view has a replay button where you can watch the candles kind of form but they're they're little stilted because it's not completely painting the candle okay and you can't practice with entering like that you can only just study how price moved and gravitated towards certain levels it's the best thing you can have if you if you at least consider doing that much that's good but if you really want to take it to the next level and say you're running a business or if you're going to school or you have a job and you can't watch the time frame around the opening of the index Futures and I like watching it around 8:30 in the morning New York local time to 11:00 there's usually a setup in there that I'm going to be able to find obviously You' seen I did multiple setups and executions today but the point is this that's like that sweet little spot in the morning that I focus on I teach that in this YouTube channel I teach it in my my paid mentorship group so you're getting real stuff here it's not something that was contrive I didn't just make it up because this day worked out in my favor my students recognize these things also and these are simple elements that repeat what you're looking for is a run on liquidity buy stops or sell stops if you're bearish you're looking for buy stops to be ran then a break-in Market structure lower a short-term low being broken that's what it looks like right here shortterm swing low we have a candle High I'm sorry a candle higher to the left with with its low here then you have the low of this candle and the next candle's higher low than this one so you have a swing low formed if you have that and then you have a break below that if it happens that creates a gap like this that's what you're looking for when it trades up into that you can go short or if you want to use cell stops you can use a cell stop in this candle here and this let it trip you in and then use the high of that candle as your stop that may be too wide for you but I I mentioned the logic around this is you're using a micro okay micros aren't that big of a deal it's not a lot of money okay you're not risking a full Futures leverage it's very very small so if you're looking at these types of setups and you can find them forming repeatedly over and over and over again and you study them you're going to see that you don't need to get these little five handle moves these little 10 handle moves you can make a living doing that don't get me wrong I'm not trying to say that people cannot be profitable and wildly profitable but when you learn how to do something like this and you're able to pull down this number of handles and then you have sound money management nothing compares to it folks these are the things that I use when you watched on when I was on Twitter and I ran up the demo accounts really high these are types of setups I was using these types of setups and as the account grew it was more demo account leverage well I'm not using a demo account right now I'm showing you with a think or Swim and anybody that knows think or Swim when I'm showing you those screenshots the paper trading shows as orange everything on that page is orange when it's a live account it's green okay also here's the rub with a demo account it's just demo demo demo demo okay I am not trying to promote the idea that you're going to get rich notice that account hasn't gone Bonkers it hasn't ran up to a million dollars because this mentorship is to hopefully inspire you to pick up a skill that if you deem it useful and you decide at your own discretion and your own timing and you assume that risk on your own because I'm not going to tell you to do this if you decide to get really good at this and you put money behind it that's a skill set that could I'm not promising but it could alleviate some of the problems with what I believe is coming in terms of financial hardship not just in America but everywhere jobs are getting harder and harder to have the economy is a mess so how do we answer that how do we get another income stream coming in this is in my opinion this is one of the ways that you can at least investigate the idea of doing it all right so I'm going to give you some homework in closing I want you to go through all of the e- mini Futures Contract charts okay just like I showed you here these time frames go back and look at the presentation and see what the time frames I gave you listen to what I gave you in terms of audio commentary that is enough in fact I gave you a ton and it may have your head spinning if you're brand new to me or if you're brand new to technical analysis or trading me feel like man is too fast do not send me an email I promise you the lessons I have planned will help eliminate and answer majority of the things you're going to ask just try to study and keep up with the pace that I'm going to put you through which isn't going to be all that bad but as we progress deeper into the teachings many of the questions that are going to come up or when you start going into the homework assignment where you're looking at old data an intraday chart is anything less than a daily chart so like a 4H hour chart that's intraday 1 hour chart that's intraday 5 minute 3 minute 2 minute 1 minute all those time frames are intraday what you're going to be looking for are breaks in Market structure after a pool of liquidity okay buy stops or sell stops have been taken in an opposing direction of your weekly expected range in other words are you expecting higher prices or lower prices on the weekly range so if you're looking for lower prices your focus is on a run above an old high once that forms then you're looking for a break- in Market structure on a lower time frame once that occurs and you have an imbalance that's your trigger okay and then you split that range that was created find out where the 50% is and then if you're selling short you want to find something like an old low or an imbalance to aim for as your Target and you want to get the closest Target don't try to get fancy and say okay well I think it's going to go down to that lowest low and try to use that for your exit because sometimes these markets can deny you that so lwh hanging fruit is how I teach you want to have the easiest Target and then allow the market to go farther and you just not be a part of it it's okay is is 125 130 Handles in an index not good enough I think it's good enough but I'm probably just biased but the homework assignment is again you going through the charts using the logic I framed in this introduction lesson looking for Breakin Market structure I also have lessons in this YouTube channel that talks about Market structure breaks and things like that and then you're going to look for the imbalance in price which is that fair value cap then you're going to determine where an opposing high or low resides than log and back test the number of handles you see in hindsight examples and other words how much did it offer and you're going to get a collection of doing that the next lesson I'm actually going to show you how to go back into the charts and look for them how to log them in your journal and give you more insights about how you can find these setups that repeat every single week okay so again I'm going to build on this foundation in the next episode The Next Episode will will be next Tuesday and the time upload will be 10:00 New York local time hopefully you've enjoyed this one until I'll talk to you next time I wish you good luck and good training

all right folks welcome back all right so this is the tuesday january 25th 2022 ict mentorship on the youtube channel all right so this is the internal range liquidity and market structure shift lecture all right so i gave you homework on the community tab if you have not been paying attention to that that's where i'm kind of keeping you abreast as to what you should be expecting next or something that just comes to mind that i feel like sharing so this is the link i sent out the other day and i wanted you to go through this particular chart and look for reasons that provided the market structure shift and the buy side and sell side liquidity so if you have not done that please stop the video and do that now otherwise you're cheating yourself of learning opportunity all right so here is that chart again 15 minute time frame on the e-mini nasdaq 100 futures contract for march delivery 2022. and take your attention over here okay this old low and these relative equal highs see that old low below that is cell stops and relative equal highs above that is buy stops now you could have used this high here there's nothing inherently wrong about that but whenever i see equal highs like this might and if it's higher than an old high over here i'm going to use that so that way there's a little bit of insight for you for your study journal the sell side liquidity you can see that the market trades down hits that runs through it then rallies all the way back up clearing equal highs so the buy stops have been taken here okay so at both of these price points here and here that's the i guess the point at which you'll look for or anticipate a market structure shift you don't force it okay i see a lot of people try to teach my concepts it'll talk about market structure breaks or shifts and we'll use that term interchangeably but for intraday i want you to think about intraday market structure shifts because it's not necessarily a break in market structure that leads to prolonged multi-day movement okay what do i mean by that if you see a market structure that's bearish and it's broken to the downside intraday that may just lead to an intraday price leg that may eventually see that high be taken out in the same day so that's why i'm using the term market structure shift not market structure break for our conversation here on this mentorship just know that when i'm gonna lean on that term market structure break it means a little bit more in context versus an intraday shift in market structure just means that there's likely a downside draw or an upside draw intraday by saying the term shift okay so there's a little bit of semantics there all right so we have both of these areas here and here where there would be a likelihood of a market structure shift up here we look for a fake run above here so that fake run above how do we know it's going to be a market structure shift that's bearish i get that question a lot even from mentorship students what you're looking for is the evidence i'm going to show you here tonight okay forget everything else everybody else says about market structure breaks and shifts and all that stuff this is it okay this is the brass tacks there's absolutely nothing else that you need to know about it i promise you if they add anything to it it's just because they want to sound and look different but this is the algorithmic perspective of a market structure shift in today now keep this price level in mind so it's essentially fourteen thousand six hundred and fourteen thousand eight twenty we're just eyeballing it okay now dropping all the way down into a two minute chart this is that same particular day here's those relative equal highs and this run down here okay if you recall 14 6 and around that 14 860 or so okay if you look at this market structure without having the levels on your chart it's easy to get lost in all the quote unquote noise the uninitiated and i know it's going to razz the people that don't care to really learn here but the uninitiated folks that will watch a video or listen to some of the lectures i'll put out they're trying to bring something in they're trying to bring in their preconceived notions and ideas about what they think they understand about markets or technical analysis or something in price action and i want to kind of like allow you to just put that aside for a moment and just imagine this chart is the first time you looked at price action for the first time and that's hard but kind of like strip away everything else that you want to bring to the conversation no order block discussion no breaker no none of that stuff okay supply and demand elliott wave all that garbage if you look at this price action here when we had this low form right before this low was formed there's a swing high right there now in the first mentorship video i gave you i mentioned that high frequency trading algorithms will use market structure on a three minute two minute and one minute chart many times sub one minute that would be like 45 second 30 second 15 second intervals okay what the algorithms are actually doing and this is also going to correct a lot of people out there because they put out misinformation it's so nonsensical but i'm challenging you to go into your charts and see if this is not what's actually going on because it happens every day if high frequency algorithms are operating every single day then these signatures will be in the chart okay if you look at this short term high here right before this low formed when this high is taken out right there on that candle that's significant only only if this run down here has traded into sell stops okay below an old love some kind it could be a a double bottom it could be a single low okay but it's got to be trading under some retail idea that would be viewed as support up here the same thing we're trading above highs so we know that above old highs a neophyte perspective will be these are unknown orders so therefore that's a flawed perspective on price action how do you know there's liquidity up there how do you know there's buy stops up there it's just logic it's simple look at the chart everybody's trying to do something based on some kind of theory logic whatever some system there's buyers and sellers coming in at all times their buying and selling quote unquote strength or pressure has absolutely no bearing on where these prices are going to go i know that may shake individuals that think they know something about the markets oh i have an uncle that used to be on the floor of the chicago board of trade and blah blah blah the mercantile exchange guys say this i don't care okay i don't care what any of those folks say because they didn't design the algorithm so again put all those you know talking points and everybody else's opinion you've adopted because you probably heard someone else talk about it and you subscribe to the review because it's easier just to do that instead of going and looking at it for yourself and that's what i'm asking you to do i'm telling you this is my personal belief you're going to see proof of these things in a live account execution but i want you to see the logic behind it because if you can see this you'll be light years ahead of everyone else and you'll laugh in the face of all these people that are going to tell you you're wasting your time trying to learn this i promise you this lesson is going to change a lot for you when this run above these relative equal highs happens right there you're anticipating a market structure shift you're not forcing it you're not trying to get ahead of it okay i don't think any of you are going to have the skill set to do that there are ways to know when to sell short right above that not even wait for the shift in market structure just like there's ways to know to be a buyer down here without seeing that short term high broken then looking for a buy over here the opposite see this swing low let me go back to this for a second we have this high on this candle then we have the candle right after that here the highest one and then the lower high of this candle here so that's a swing high very simple little pattern but it means a lot when it's in the proper context when this high is broken with this particular candle right there that is significant only on the basis that we have taken liquidity out of the marketplace that's it so when it broke this short term high this is more meaningful and then the market will start to seek buy stops okay or buy side liquidity that would rest above here here and here now i shared an example of live executions and i was teaching on the idea of utilizing micros which are essentially two dollars per handle okay so or 50 cents per tick this chart is nasdaq e-mini this would represent twenty dollars per handle and there's four ticks in each handle there's your twenty dollars per handle okay so again what that means is fourteen six eighty to fourteen six eighty one that's one handle or four ticks there are some that will doubt the idea that you can trade all these little internal swings okay and i'm going to give you some insights on how i was doing it okay the main context of this lesson is for you to go in to your charts and try to prove me wrong okay that's the challenge here that's your homework i want you to learn what i'm doing in this lesson here and then you go into your charts back testing and i'll show you what that looks like what does it mean to be back testing and what you're looking for and how you're going to screen capture all those things but your mission is to go into the charts and look for this not being true okay this is exactly what i did on baby pips back in 2010 i told everybody do not take my word for it don't take my word for it go into the charts and see if this is true or not i believe it but i don't want to try to convince you because i won't you'll convince yourself once you start seeing it it's it it's over there's no argument after that okay but it's simple logic very simple this is a very clean chart is it not all i'm going to do is add a few annotations and this is about as extensive of lipstick we put on our chart i know it's shocking right can you still see the candles because it might be a little obstructive i'm being facetious you see these guys out there with these charts that have graffiti all over it you can't even see the price candle nothing you can't you can't see any of it but there's all kinds of overlays of all kinds of nonsense which means absolutely nothing because algorithms could care less about any of that stuff triangles harmonic this crabs it's crazy i know but hey everybody's gotta have a religion so here's those cell stops so this little area here shaded in that's a area where cell stops would be residing below that 14 600 level okay on that 15 minute time frame so the market dove into that liquidity and you may or may not know that is a buy you don't need to you anticipate a shift in market structure when the market rallies above when does that happen on this candle right here see that little light bulb that's when you're thinking okay now i have a condition in the marketplace that i might see an opportunity intraday let's see if there's further evidence to that high is taken here we traded above it it does not need to close above that okay real important once that candle closes and this candle opens you're gonna monitor this candle and you want to see as soon as this candle closes does it create that fair value gap if it creates a fair value gap again that's a candle with a high one single pass up next candle has a load it doesn't completely overlap all this that's a fair value real simple okay this candle is where you would look to potentially trade at the earliest because now there's a gap there the market trades down into that boom takes off here is insight that everybody needs to understand because they're out here running around on youtube trying to teach order block theory order blocks okay i invented it it's mine no one talked about it before me and i first mentioned it in 2010 on baby pips prior to that 1996 i was only teaching it to people one-on-one in teachings that's it okay you can't find it in books prior to that it's mine no one else taught it before me it is mine so i'm going to correct all of you today so that way you can teach your people correctly and not hurt them see these down closed candles see that that's all one continuous order block what's it doing it's inside that pool of liquidity cell stops where's the open on that series of down closed candles right here that's the price level extending out in time boom so inside this fair value gap this opening price on the order block that's your buy plus three pips or whatever for spread and that's what you would use for a limit order hmm that's pretty neat in it well price starts to run where above the highs where by slots will be here above this high here and above this high here now go back and look at the example where this particular day here i put in orders and i was still learning how to use the thinkorswim platform and there's a little toggle box where if you toggle it it'll send your order right to the marketplace it won't let you review it and i had put that on to see if it was going to show me any kind of information on the screen but i didn't take it off so what happened was i put that on it was actually an order that i mistakenly had in so i was hoping to see if it could give me an opportunity to get out of it and cover with next to nothing or maybe even squeak out a profit it wasn't having it so i had to reverse and go back and go short wrote it down and then you'll see me covering in here and then going long selling short reversing going short buying long in here inside the order block rallied up sold the long reversed it bought it here got out over here and resold for that big run into that okay that's what i was doing there's people out there going to tell you he doesn't trade that way these people don't know how i'm trading you have no idea how i'm trading none of you do okay i'm teaching you obviously for those individuals that are outside my paid mentorship which is not open so please stop emailing asking people are still sending me emails can i join no you can't join be content with this i'm teaching you gold and it's costing you nothing but the time to sit down here and if it doesn't work you're going to know right away okay i'm not wasting your time i'm going right into the brass tacks that way the people that are weak minded will know right away this is it or it's not that way you'll know this is too much work for you and that's fine go and do whatever you got to do and i wish you good luck but the individuals that really put the time in and test what i'm challenging to look for you're going to see it's there and it repeats like clockwork okay it's real important you have that mindset so the buy stops above here that was taken this swing low forms once this candle closes so this candle we're watching does it go below that short term low it does so now we have a shift in market structure that is now bearish only because we've taken buy stops okay if everybody got forms the market rallies up into that you go short there what are you looking for below here sell stops below here cell stops below here cell stops and in this fair bay gap here so if you are in a position that has multiple contracts or say you have a forex trade because this works in forex too it's not just limited to futures again i'm just using this asset class because i cut my teeth on these markets when everybody else was still in elementary school that's trying to teach today i was trading the s p okay i probably sound like a young guy but i'm actually getting turned 50. so i've been around for a long time 30 years this november 5th 30 years that's three decades and the things i'm teaching you i'm not teaching you one trick pony insight these things work on all asset classes now i'm not going to co-sign the crypto markets because that only my students are reporting that this stuff works there i don't even mess around with it that much then though okay but you can take partials below here i probably wouldn't do it there but below here here and there's something you're saying why wouldn't you take them below their ict well if you're trying to get short here that's not really that much movement so if you're going to take some thing off your trade below that low why not just try to reach for that one and you could get it there right here okay and then although that low is nice as well below this low and this is what i mentioned on the first lesson okay elements to a trade setup this is below the 50 level of this high and that low okay so 50 level that's what we targeting now this candle's low was the high end or first objective inside this gap so that's your target you're gonna look for that so you're looking for low hanging fruit the easiest target to get to you're not trying to be perfect and you grow into eventually holding to see if it will fill in that gap okay this very very always going down to this candle is high that's something that you strive for over time if you understand what i just showed you here that's a very simple process of looking for number one liquidity gauging what happens without having to know for certain because you don't know you're not going to know until the market shows its hand this is it showing its hand okay that's it now let's go into a one-minute chart and see how that looks a little bit different but still has the same characteristics here's that same price structure just on a one-minute chart the same logic still there right swing high taken after liquidity has been traded into this short-term high it's violated right when this trades down in here what's actually occurring okay put this in your notes high frequency algorithms are hammering they're just throwing orders in bye bye bye bye bye that is not okay here's an important thing that is not causing okay it's not causing the market to go higher it's just volume that's coming in the algorithms that deliver price that offer price they're constantly offering the price in the marketplace that's what's beginning to spool and go higher okay and regardless of where you want to trade at your limit orders they may not get filled where you're trying to buy with a market order you may think you're getting in at 14 62 but by the time your order is executed and confirmed you're in 14 664. that's slippage okay that's negative slippage if you were trying to buy it at 14 62 and it filled you at 14 661 that's positive slippage that's better than what you were expecting so when price starts to rally all this is is a default to the algorithm constantly offering price at a higher price okay and the logic and argument for anyone who wants to say oh it's buying selling pressure this guy has no idea he's talking about i know somebody that used to trade on the floor and he's laughing at ict right now okay go into your charts forget that i'll i'll let you have that perspective for a moment for the argument but go into the charts and see if what i'm not suggesting to you is the truth okay i could sit here and do a complete series on all the things that lead to what i'm saying is true but none of you will still believe it i'm showing a live account and entries and executions and they're still doubting it so no matter what i do there's going to be people out there but you didn't do it wearing orange you didn't do it in your corvette did you flip which i don't flip corvettes you're getting all kinds of stuff out there nonsense but you don't see anybody going into that robin's cup hello so we're looking at the swing lower here market breaks down trades back back up into this back up atmosphere you got here and sells off there's another favorite you got right there trades up into that as well this is a one minute chart so it's giving you multiple points of execution that you could trade on and then dives see these two candles here that's one consecutive bearish order block the opening price extended out in time why is this a good a bearish order block because it has that gap and it's taken liquidity and there's a market structure shift there's your height frequency high power high probability bearish order block forget everybody else's interpretation of my concept the order block that's it okay what is an older block you do you see a lot of people asking what is an order block only my students and mentorship know what an order block is okay what it is it's just change in the state of delivery okay it's a change in the state of delivery the market's being offered higher higher higher in these two up close candles how did this series of up close candles begin with this candle's opening right there that opening once this candle trades below it that changes the state of delivery so you go back to that point of reference right there and that's why it's sensitive the algorithm remembers that right there okay that's all i'm going to give you on the free mentorship level but that is your answer okay that is what an order block is it is a change in the state of delivery much in the same way all of this movement down here all these down closed candles the opening on that candle starts this series of delivery on the downside when that opening price gets violated here it changes its state of delivery now it was offering sell side when it goes above that opening now it's offering buy side what will it be doing after that it will be looking for buy stops buy stops buy stops because it's offering buy side liquidity see you guys don't even know what you're talking about you're trying to teach my concepts and you have no idea what you're doing you're talking about things in the left side of the chart trade it do it okay you don't even know what you're looking at and you're hurting the people you call your students and then right away when people don't know how to use them or understand what to do with them they'll say well this stuff doesn't work because they learn from someone who doesn't know what they're doing okay it's it's blatantly obvious what it is but okay same thing here buy side is being offered until that opening price is violated right there then the change of state of delivery occurs now the market's going to be doing what offering sell side liquidity what's that mean it's going to start going lower and attacking the sell stops all the sell sell equity it's offering it to the marketplace that's what's happening that's what the algorithm is doing that's what the algorithm does okay you buying and selling me buying and selling everybody over there on reddit is not going to change anything at all it's not going to do anything and the argument that defeats all that buying and selling pressure is how do you argue against the bull squeeze and the bear squeeze there's a short squeeze going on the market's rallying up when it's been bearish that's just their cop-out that's their way of saying well you know everybody shorten and now they're covering so there it is and i learned the same thing folks i believed all that garbage two thousand plus books i know what those books told me is what you are learning too because the same people teaching today retail garbage elliott wave this and that it's all stupid stuff man it has nothing to do with why these markets are doing what they're doing zero has nothing to do with it don't worry i got proof today but the market goes down to that 50 level because it's going down to what i teach you what did i say in the first video it's going down from a premium market relative to this low and this high 50 is here that's equilibrium so it's going to go down to a discount and that's that gap right in here it doesn't look like a gap so much here but if you go back up one more time that's that single opening right there on a two-minute chart and then on a one-minute chart it's two candles that make that up but you're gonna have to do is go through a progression of going from the three minute two minute and one minute chart and you'll get your market structure and your areas of where it wants to look for an imbalance or overload high and it just makes it easy but just a real nice delivery there and here's the lipstick on it on the one minute chart swing high is broken market structure is now bullish rallies taking buy stops taking buy stops taking buy stops this right here these highs right here is just staying below that low it's building up more interest that this is what resistance that is engineering liquidity that way when this runs above it those individuals that know what you're learning today they know that that's a pool of liquidity for buyers coming in at a high price why is that useful because smart money that bought down here or here or here or here or here that's where they sell to high seeking buyers it's not hard logic folks it's not complicated okay it just feels complicated because you see other people trying to teach something and you hear or read in the comments you're teaching it better than ict does no you don't [Laughter] no you're not you're not doing you're actually teaching it incorrectly and without the real context of what it is that you're missing but i get it you think every down closed candle is a bullish order block and up claim that one is a very short block and that's not the case look in here okay for the guys that say i did not take trades or i didn't trade this way see that gap right there see that see that down closed candle right there that's your order block boom by it right there what about this right here dropping down all these candles here are more significant if you look at it on the two minute chart see that it becomes one order block right in here buy it sell short buy it again we got up into the stops sell short reverse and ride the larger swing down don't listen these yahoos out there to say that i'm not proving something to you i'm proving it that's what i said i was going to come out here this year and do that's this whole point of being here this year it's my 30th anniversary november 5th i've been a trader in the markets living and breathing this stuff for 30 years you're not really in any position to demand anything from me i enjoy doing this but i don't need to provide any kind of proof to you either but i'm loving it this year i'm slowly putting it out there and enjoying all the naysayers and the things they're saying and it's just fun because they have no idea what i'm about to bring this entire year none of you are going to doubt anything so the one-minute chart just a real nice delivery here as well filling in that very value you got change in the state of delivery now it's offering sell side what's that mean it's going to match up sell stops it's going to keep going below old lows into an imbalance until we get down to a discount is that hard is it hard to see what i'm showing you here pretty clean isn't it clean chart now i don't have all these things on my chart when i'm watching price because i already know what i'm looking for and i don't want to have any distractions and i don't want to have a level or some kind of annotation that's going to keep me thinking only with that perspective okay or that idea it allows me to be fluid with what the market's actually doing versus going in and saying okay this is what i think is going to happen and this is the only thing that can happen you understand what i just did there i allow myself to be flexible whereas if you have all these things you're putting on your chart you're only only seeing your will be done so i keep my charts clean and then i add the annotations so that way my students can see what the internal dialogue in my mind was while watching price do what it does naked there's nothing on the charts at all when i'm trading zero nothing okay so with that i want you to think about how this is useful okay number one you're looking at london highs and lows the session for london open okay for instance like two o'clock in the morning at five o'clock in the morning new york time every time i tell you just always set it with new york local time two o'clock to five o'clock in the morning that's your london session what's the highs and lows of that session okay that's important because the market's going to probably sweep above those highs or sweep below those lows and create situations like this okay and the new york session is seven o'clock in the morning to 10 o'clock in the morning new york local time okay what's the session high and low for that and do the same thing for asia okay 7 p.m to 9 p.m and that's it those are the three times of the day that i'm looking for specific key highs and kilos and any intraday high and low forming right before the equities open at 9 30. pretty easy right the hours of operation again are generally between 8 30 in the morning until 11 but it can be extended to new york lunch noon i do not tend to take trades after noon local time in new york that hour is usually very problematic and it just it's better not to even look for any kind of setups wait until one o'clock preferably really 1 30 to 4 o'clock then you get that afternoon trend typically you'll see between two o'clock and three o'clock there's a setup that usually forms in the afternoon trend or set up in that period of the time of the day that will also offer opportunities but that's outside the scope of what i'm going to be teaching in this mentorship but there's lots of things you can look on youtube about the afternoon session and you can just combine some of the things that i'm going to teach you here and just it's not hard to make a you know an addition to what you're learning here so if you want to trade the afternoon session you can obviously pick up some insights from other youtubers that do trade futures but for developing students this is enough i promise you this is enough okay all right so we talked about internal range liquidity and internal range liquidity is looking for short-term lows or short-term highs inside a price leg that we're retracing back into okay that's all it means internal range liquidity is a short term higher low with stops above or below it or an imbalance in that same range of price action and i taught you market structure shifts showed you exactly all that's necessary that is all that you require and the skill set of identifying pools of liquidity that is going to be something you learn rather quickly just by going through old data and looking at the times of the day i gave you in this lecture all right your homework is you're going to go through your e-mini futures intraday charts and you'll be looking for stop hunts that lead to market structure shifts intraday you're going to log your examples with your own annotations for your study journal so what i showed with the break in the market going higher and lower above old highs or lower below an old low that's running for stops that's a stop hunt then you're looking for that signature for the market structure shift on the three two and or one minute charts okay if you look for that between 8 30 in the morning to noon new york local time in the e-mini markets or if you're watching the micro markets the same logic exists okay but you're going to start going back from today and go back as far as the data will allow you the more you do it and you annotate your charts the more experience you're going to have and it's pseudo experience yes but you're teaching your brain i use this analogy a lot with my paid mentorship students it's like hunters okay to know where you're gonna find a deer if that's what you're going to go out and hunt you need to know how to track one okay or sit up in this tree stand and wait for it to walk by but usually they go out and they walk around in the woods and look for tracks would you know what a deer track looks like before i was shown one i didn't know what it was okay but because i'm showing you what it looks like that's all this lesson was predominantly focusing on is the actual view of what it looks like the details what you don't need is anything above and beyond what i've shown you the only thing you need is what i've shown you here it's simple it's straight to the point and i'm only talking to that way you understand that this is all that is required notice there is no commitment of traders notice there's no breakers notice that i've stripped it down to the chrome now this is the only way you can trade but i'm showing you something that i think personally is in my opinion this is so universally simplistic all of you should be able to do this one okay in my opinion i think this is it and that's why i more or less built it because i think my daughter which has zero interest in trading i think that this is going to be easy for her to see it and understand what to look for it doesn't have a lot of moving parts notice that it's very specific times of the day specific highs and lows you're going to look for it's simple but you won't appreciate how simple it is until you go back into your charts and you annotate your 15-minute time frame for your buy-side liquidity pool and your sell-side liquidity pools and then going down into the three-minute two-minute moment chart so for every individual day that you're logging and you're back testing back testing is just dressing your chart up like i'm showing you here and then studying it not just do it say okay i'm done really going to see how price moved and how it delivered how many pips did it move how long did it move going higher or lower how much drawdown did it put on your position if you would have taken one all of those things you want to annotate that in your chart so that way when you go back through your study journal you'll have many examples that look at and because you're looking at it and you're seeing it over and over again repetitively when you have a period of time where nothing feels like it's working and you feel confused you want to go back through your study journal and look at these examples because it will encourage you through periods of time where you just feel like it isn't clicking okay it's why it's important to have a study journal because you're going to see this stuff is happening every single day every single day and don't take the infancy that you have right now and the lack of experience and amplify that to there's no way i can learn how to do this because that's a lie that's a facade don't buy into that view okay it's something that you're going to have to grow into and it's going to be quick for some and it's going to be slower for others and there's no way i can make it easier than this okay because that workload that you have to go through of back testing and logging and acquiring examples the more time you do that the more examples you acquire in back testing i swear this is the secret okay because that is the thing that's the work that's required a lot of people say they do it but they don't okay they go back a couple days and say oh this is i don't think i'm getting anything from this but that's the reason why they fail because that's the work that's required you know having 10 pages in a notebook saying i took notes and you didn't take notes you scribbled you wasted your time you knew going in you weren't going to be that headstrong about doing it and that's what is required to learn this otherwise if you don't have that mindset this isn't going to be for you because it's going to require work it's going to take effort and organization and personal responsibility if you don't have those characteristics you need to develop them if you don't develop them and patients you must go out there and find somebody that's good at giving you trade signals and just submit to that and you good luck with it but this isn't it i got another portion of the video i want to show you now and i'm going to show you this logic actually working today in the nasdaq e-mini contract all right so we're looking at trading views chart in the backdrop and i have the td ameritrade open over top of it scrunched down so that way i can operate with the trading view and i'm going to highlight in trading view a fair value got after a market structure shift it's bullish and i'm going to show you an imbalance that is in a premium okay see that just the opposite of what i've been showing you change the color on this and the idea is i want to see it drop down into that green area but if you look real close there's actually a smaller little fair value got just below that green box okay this is not supply and demand okay the idea is i want to see it drop down to that green box and i don't know if it's going to dip into the lower fare value cap so whenever there's two fair value gaps like this this is for your notes in case you missed this the idea is i'm going to let it trade down to that lower one i'll sacrifice that better entry and if it trades down there and trades into it and then comes right back up into that green box the first higher fair value gap i'll enter when it's in there and expect that the lower one won't be retraded to okay i'm going to be trading with a stop that will have essentially three and a quarter percent risk i'm not suggesting that's a size of risk for you i'm just telling you that's what i have in mind when i'm taking this trade and this is again just my personal belief in this i'm not suggesting that you should believe me or you subscribe to this view because i'm showing you a live account this does not mean that every trade you take forward from this day on is going to be like this it doesn't mean it guarantees profit it doesn't but my belief in my faith is that i've seen this work so many times over the last 30 years that i know that this is something that's going to work enough for me and that's all that matters it's a personal endeavor when you're speculating if you don't have any faith in it then obviously you would never put live money in it all right so the market's starting to drop down a little bit in here and let's say for instance that it runs up into that upper rectangle first before going down to the green one then i would nix the trade and that means i wouldn't take a trade and i'd move to the sidelines and probably do nothing the rest of the morning or watch and see if there's something else that sets up all right so now i'm inside that rectangle but notice again i want to see if it goes down to that lower fair value gap that's not highlighted i'll mention it when we get into it that right there i'm willing to sacrifice that because that's actually the better buy but if we go back up into the higher fair value gap and create like a tail on this particular candle i'll see that as just running for a lower imbalance and then it should accumulate in here and i have my trigger on the buy button okay i'm just going to go in with a buy at market not trying to do anything advanced here okay and if you look at the bottom of the td ameritrade live account module you'll see nasdaq symbol and you'll actually see my profit loss going as the trade is entered and i took a trade in the e-mini s p and it was basically a scratch i ended up making 75 so i put a trade on and came back on me stopped me and that was the end of that all right there i am putting the order in and there's the confirmation that the orders were received so now i'm long you can see at the bottom of the pop out it shows that i'm down initially what looks like 20 i know i'm up 20 right now so now down 75. so this is the part of trading where it feels scary if you've never traded with live funds and you just feel like you got to watch that number of how much money you're making and losing that's the worst thing to do okay what i'm watching is the chart does the chart continuously keep giving me feedback visually that it's accumulating and not going lower now it can go one more time back into that lower fair value gap that's permissible to me i'm willing to endure that i just don't want to see it overlap that entire thing and go lower because then i'd have to close the trade and preferably save my stop notice the bodies of the candles are staying relatively inside that fair value got the shaded green now i again i'm only adding this to the chart because i knew i was going to record it and share it with you today but i do not have this in my charts okay the only annotations i have in my charts is when i'm teaching my students and since you're here at least for right now i'm calling you my student even the haters all right so with the aid of hindsight because i lived this moment this morning it does go down one more time and stab into those wicks that are forming now when you put a trade on you kind of like give the complete control of everything to the marketplace and you want to just allow the market to do what it's going to do and not try to overthink every fluctuation every little minor movement in the price action is not something that is going to hopefully sway you so i've already had it in my mind that it could go back down and make a slightly lower low than those two little wicks that it's formed inside the lower fair value gap so since i had that expectation that it could potentially do that i'm desensitizing myself to that in the event that it forms an ideal scenario would be it doesn't do it at all obviously but i'm allowing for that price action especially with the volatility that we've been seeing the last few days and what i'm thinking right now is they're taking it down one more time to accumulate more longs notice i'm saying that not it's selling pressure driving price down i think this uh this is where i took the most heat on the trade if i'm not mistaken i think it's like 455 dollars of trade drawdown while being still in the trade which is below the threshold i've already said my maximum risk on a trade if i'm trading competitively is four and a half percent per trade generally i like to take a trade that i feel comfortable with around three three and a half percent that's a good trade for me okay showing signs initially that it's wanting to go higher and what i'm trying to do is keep my focus on that lower level or the the bottom of that pink rectangle that's the low hanging fruit that's the easy target i'm telling you to try to practice and learn to reach for the ideal scenario would be to go all the way to the top of that pink but while you're learning don't do that okay it's easier just to let it trade the low end and just take it off when it gives it to you i have my trigger on the flatten button so it cancels every order takes me completely out of the marketplace as soon as it touches the low end of that rectangle i'll collapse the trade right now i'm up seven nine almost nine hundred dollars eight ninety five nine thirty five nine twenty five and again you can watch that fluctuation in the lower right hand corner of the pop out i'm at 1100 plus 11.49 okay traded there touched it now i'm collapsing the trade there just like that and that's it now my account's booked and mark to market with eleven hundred ninety dollars and gain in the balance now reflects it with twenty seven thousand nine hundred fifteen dollars and eleven cents so there's trading view showing the chart i'm watching because i like trading these charts i don't like td ameritrades charts it's i don't like them so i'm just using the pop out which is why are you showing us things scrunched up you're just i'm not hiding anything you can see it it's right there so let's go over and take a look at the chart now you can see nothing has changed i just magnified that pop out so it's entirely taking up my entire screen we're gonna go to the nasdaq e-mini contract simple and i am so clumsy with this platform still and i'm sure i'll get real good at by the middle of the year and not nudge all right so we're gonna look at this day and there's the chart on one minute and i'm gonna add an overlay okay but i'm going to put in so you can see where the trades are in that chart there's the executions and there is these areas i showed you on the trading view chart so for the inquiring minds that wanted to see a live chart and live account and all that business and the logic of what i'm teaching in the youtube channel i humbly submit this and so i'll talk to you on thursday be safe

all right folks welcome back so this lesson is going to be a little bit shorter more direct to the point and we'll be looking at some examples since I showed you uh what we're looking for on Tuesday night so Wednesday's trading and Thursday's trading we'll take a look at that all right first up is the EM mini S&P March delivery contract for 2022 Wednesday January 26th once you take a look at this low over here okay and don't just use my charts you want to look at your charts and go through it from your platform your broker whatever feed that you're using this is trading view it's a free charting package when it's end of data but if you want to have real time I think I'm paying $4 a month for the data it's not really expensive but you want to have the low over here on Wednesday the 26th and you'll see why I picked that low there because it's the low okay and then this is the high so we have this price run from this low to this High that's our range so you want to drop your FIB on that now get your equilibrium price point so as the highs we're r through we have that run up the market gets pushed into a premium it's really expensive and then we want to wait to see does it break down below the old high it does but does it create a fair value Gap in here no then it rallies one more time then breaks down again inside here there's a break-in Market structure we see it here then it runs back up into the fair B Gap here and then sells off reaching into this old low which would be below the equilibrium price point of this entire range or 50% level on the FIB okay put some lipstick on this again here's the low and the high equilibrium which is a 50 level and the 50 Bach so we're looking for a low or an imbalance below this level okay so we have a swing low here we have an imbalance here that could be a Target notice how we hit it there and came off of it more pronounced low here and draws down into that so inside this shaded Blue Area we're going to take a closer look at the details okay we're zoomed in a little bit again still on a 2-minute chart previous High short-term high and 8:30 in the morning that starts the hunt basically that's what 8:30 in the morning is to me so we're looking for an old high to be violated it does so here then it breaks there's a break-in Market structure swing low this candle over here that sets the stage now you have a opportunity does price draw back up into the fair value Gap after this candle breaks below here and giving you a bearish market structure shift yes it trades up in the ne value Gap you can go short there and again you could Target this old low here or that low that was annotated before we zoomed in and look at the beautiful delivery there so hypothetical short from here and hypothetical cover here you would log that in your study Journal don't use my examples here alone go into your own charts and an them as well so shorting around we'll say 4419 and covering at we'll say 4382 just to be you know not perfect that's the opportunity of the range but you don't have to have all of that it's still very very nice delivery based on the logic I taught you on Tuesday and the first lesson on the previous week's Friday again there's that fair Val you got and that's your candle that would be considered as a ideal entry and the discount hold low as a Target right there so your charts would look just like this in any open space like over here you would just type in whatever important factors that you found insightful about this example how long did it take okay how long did it take from the market structure shift occurr ing how much time did it take to get up into the fair value capap that's real important how long did it take before it went from your entry down to your Target in time how much heat or Draw down would you have weathered getting short now if you used this candle's high as your entry point you technically could have got filled here but in here I want to teach you to look at the total range available and in hindsight okay because it gives you a framework to look for how these examples while they're not exactly the same they don't repeat exactly photocopy of every single previous instance of it there's a lot of similarities that you'll find that are reoccurring and that's the important factor to train your eye to see it remember the analogy I gave you on Tuesday night about the deer track and being a hunter you have to know what a deer track looks like you have to know what a deer track is to stalk it effectively well this is your pattern and setup so you need to go in looking for it so it reinforces the idea that you know what it looks like all right we're looking at the e- mini nasac futures for Thursday January 27th 2022 this is a 5 minute chart this is the time frame you start with and you work down okay so on the 5 minute right away we can see the low to the high and we're looking for a high and go back in time in your chart and you'll find what this is here but you have these relative equal highs as well so that could have been a initial objective looking for these relative equal highs to be taken out and does it break down and give you a fair value Gap no it doesn't so it wouldn't even meet the criteria there I know some of you might be looking say well how do you know it doesn't get you on a trade here listen to the rules I gave you they're very specific and that's what I'm walking you through here that way you can see it's kind of allowing the market or really forcing the market to show you its hand and once it does that then you can go in and act accordingly but you have to wait for the setup you can't force it you can't think it's there it's there or it's not so we have old High Here by liquidity resting above that and we have a run above it once it goes above here doesn't go above it and break down and then go down below that short-term low there no it goes higher so we just keep waiting for a break lower to get a shift in the market structure on an intraday basis so we have a swing low here it trades down through it on this candle here so right away at that moment on this candle soon as this candle trades through it you now have an opportunity then you go back into the high to that candle low and do you see a fair value Gap it's right there okay this Market rallies back up trades into it here you can be a short seller there and the market breaks down one more time ret trades back into it and reaches below the equilibrium price point he has a couple targets here you could be here here or in the inbalance and it hits all of them and goes a little bit further lower all right so that was quick and hopefully painless and again we're looking at internal range liquidity and Market structure shifts intraday my advice is for you to go back through more data use the weekend that's coming and acquire more of those examples so that way you can include them in your study Journal next week I'll work on targeting refinement and entries until I'll talk to you then enjoy your weekend and be safe

all right folks welcome back this is the 2022 ICT mentorship on YouTube and this lesson is going to be intraday order flow and understanding the daily range all right folks we're looking at tradingview.com and you can can use this platform for free uh there are some benefits to having a membership there it's not terribly expensive but nonetheless it provides you a means of looking at charts that I show in my mentorship here and in my private mentorship group so it's the same charts that I'm producing for that community that I'm producing for you as well everything in this lecture is going to be predominantly around teaching you the elements of the e- mini setting up your daily range and your intraday layouts and I'll talk a little bit about daily profiles so that way I'll help you and I'll compare in contrast showing you what it is that you're trying to learn from me here versus what is available out there in the internet okay so that way you can decide whether or not this is going to be a worthwhile Pursuit for you these things that I'm teaching today are direct ly linked to index features okay like S&P NASDAQ and theal okay you can use the Russell 200000 those are the markets that I'm targeting with the lessons the ideas of trading the Asian range and things like that they are not applicable to these markets I don't teach that to my students I want you to just focus on the things I'm going to show you in this mentorship all right first things first I'm going to get the boring stuff right out of the way whenever you're looking at Futures especially the index Futures these contracts trade with expiration dates and the months that they trade are going to be shown here es is the symbol for E mini S&P H in this example stands for March so the delivery month codes for the commodity markets H is always representing the month of March m is June U is September Z is December these are the only four months that the index Futures trade on E mini S&P e mini NASDAQ and E mini Dow okay the year obviously is what it is now if you're going to be using like for instance when I take live trades in the TDM trade they don't take their year symbol like this it's 22 but in trading view if you're pulling out the symbol like I have here e2022 that represent the Emin S&P 500 contract for delivery month March year 2022 okay since they expire it's important for you to know that the third Friday of the month of delivery which is obviously in this example here March the third Friday of that month is expiration you do not want to be trading after expiration and the question is going to be is when when do I start trading the next month out okay this is always going to be the front month or the current month or nearby contract the month after the front month or current contract month is always going to be referred to by me as the next month out if you ever have a doubt you can go to barchart.com and you can go to the select commodity tab here this is all free you can scrub down into this list here go to S&P 500 E mini click on that it'll open up what I just showed you there and the the first one that's the cash you don't want to look at that the next contract available is March see that even gives you the little cheat right now this is considered the front month or nearby contract the open interest is what I'm watching okay so one week before expiration which is the third Friday of the delivery contract month month so third Friday of March third Friday of June third Friday of September third Friday of December roll over to a new year starts the sequence all over again March June September December real easy pattern real easy means of keeping track of where you're supposed to be at but usually around the first or second day of the week prior to expiration I start monitoring open interest and I want to be in the month that has the larger open interest number notice that the June contract only has 57,124 million so this is the larger liquidity base contract month so I'm going to be trading this month if it becomes a matter of this month here has larger open interest than this one here then I'm going to be trading the next month out because I want the liquidity that's available in the larger pool liquidity offered by the most traded contract month okay so hopefully that answered that question got a lot of questions regarding that all right so now what we're looking for is an opportunity and I'm going to teach bias and specific entry techniques next week this week I'm teaching you the intraday framework and I want you to start thinking about market profiles and you're going to have homework assignments obviously for that at the end of this video but we're going to assume that you were bullish in here okay I'm going to provide proof in this video that I was bullish and I did execute with that bias in mind but but just kind of put that to the sideline I know some of you are very anxious and you're leaving comments saying can you teach me how to get in you know what you know what am I looking for I understand your excitement but take the lessons at the pace that I'm giving you because I'm giving you homework assignments and studying so that way it helps build and ingrain the understanding I'm giving you because your study time is actually going to be where the majority of your learning is going to come from I'm just giving you you know points of reference so that way you can go in and start looking at things and start seeing a reoccurring repeating phenomenon but I want to take a look at the 15minute time frame all right and when you're looking at this 15-minute time frame this is the Bell weather time frame this is where I'm looking for key highs and lows I'm looking for imbalances like fair value gaps and things of that nature um yes I'll look for order blocks but I'm going to try to stay away from order blocks in this lesson in this mentorship really because I have models that don't even rely on order blocks obviously I'm teaching fair value Gap here and that is the main focus because it repeats it's easy pattern it's it's there a lot but I want you to think about how you frame your day so when you're in trading view or you can do this in your own platform if you're not using trading view but I'm recommending you at least while you're going through mentorship here on YouTube to go through the process with trading view all right and then this is what you would classically see annotated in my chart for a Forex setup I'm taking you to 8:30 okay you're going to put a vertical line there at 8:30 click this clone I know this is very boring for some of you because you really want to just get in there and get to the nuts and bolts but I have new people watching the same video so I have to make this as complete as possible and try to cover all the bases and then hopefully I don't get as many emails cuz I can't keep up with them and so if you email me and I'm not responding I apologize but I just I I can't keep up with it all right so we looking at there you go that's good all right so the equal distance and time in the morning then an hour lunch New York lunch and then an equal amount of time after that okay so I want to zoom in here and in your mind I want you to think about that lunch hour and this is always New York local time okay set your trading view chart to this if you do that no matter where you are in the world you'll be able to calibrate your local time with this okay everything I'm showing you is directly linked to New York local time if you do it with any other time frame you're going to mess up you won't have the same calibrations as all my students in what I'm looking at in price because eventually I'm going to be showing you charts on my community tab that I want you to be watching before it happens but before I even start doing that I'm not going to create a train wreck by having everybody looking at charts in their own local time and not New York time and completely miss the the point and plot so once we have this I want you to think of this hour here noon to 1:00 in the afternoon New York time that is a no trade time period I don't care who tells you that they can do this and do that if you're learning from me just don't trade during that time okay not even in demo because just trust me don't do it okay as we go through the mentorship you'll understand more reasons why I just can't give everything in one video obviously I want to and I I want to do 4H hour long teachings but but I'm trying to make them palatable because I know majority of you don't have the attention span because you're new and you're just now discovering so I'm trying to bear that in mind when I'm making these presentations so you have your daily range on an intraday basis all set up and laid out so these are your boundaries your morning trade is between 8:30 in the morning why because there's news events that come out at 8:30 all the way to noon preferably around 11:00 I generally don't like to take trades after 11 o'clock in the morning now it doesn't mean I haven't or that I won't I just generally try not to I want to try to be positioned before 11:00 and hopefully be riding something into the New York lunch at noon and then you know squaring positions or taking some off if I'm going to hold through the lunch and anticipate something going through to the close and we'll talk about that when we get into profiles not volume profile okay uh the idea of the afternoon session I wasn't going to teach that but because I see a lot of nonsense on YouTube I'm going to I'm just going to teach it to you okay so it's going to be a complete daily treaties on the entire daily range of indices so that way if you're interest is in this asset class you'll have a far better chance of being successful in my opinion using the information I'm going to give you okay and I'm proving it with actual executions as you'll see later in the video all right so we're looking at prior to 8:30 what are you looking for okay I got a lot of questions in the comment section I'm reading all the comments folks I love it because it's real short little Snippets I know a lot of my students they like to send me these really long-winded appreciative emails and then they give me one chart that doesn't really explain much to me and I can't really answer it so the comment section that I'm opening up on every one of these videos if you haven't noticed I'm allowing one comment that to kind of like honor those individuals that are showing appreciation and they're not gratuitously you know looking to praise me I don't like that okay I I I like the appreciation for my time and energy and sacrifice giving it to you for free but I don't want to be worshiped okay I don't want all that kind of stuff don't call me the goat don't call me you the greatest of all time I don't like that kind of stuff but if you have something that you want me to touch on and improve a delivery or explanation of a specific thing I mentioned in a video I may already have something in a future lesson planned but if it's something that I don't have in my outline that's going to be in future videos I'll utilize the feedback I get okay so that way I understand some of you want everything all at one time and there's no way I can do the all that in one time but I am taking the feedback back I'm getting from you all and I'm using that okay but one of the questions I got was what highs and lows are we looking for that you know a stop run would be framed on or what would be the Catalyst for a stop hunt well prior to 8:30 if you look at that okay we'll just grab a horizontal Ray and we see this High here and I'm utilizing this with the benefit of hindsight cuz this is how you're going to go back and back test everything I want you to take a look at the high here and the low right here so prior to 830 and other words to the left of that on a 15-minute time frame what's the most significant or obvious swing high and swing low swing high as this it's a candle with a lower high to the left of it and a lower high to the right of it three candle pattern okay it does not matter if the candles are up or down closes you're just looking for a swing High because above that's it's going to be buy side liquidity or buy stops and a swing low prior to 8:30 that's a candle that has a higher low to the left and a higher low to the right of it it's three candles again it does not matter what the close of the candles are it has absolutely no bearing on what I'm showing you here because the swing points are where liquidity is going to be placed okay so once you have these levels on your chart on a 50-minute time frame then you can drop down into your first lower time frame for entry that's your F minute chart so let's do that now all these things will be transposed right to the 5minute Chart you won't lose anything in case you're wondering I know a lot of new people are afraid if they do something with the time frame they'll lose annotations all right so now we have this old high back here look at look at this price right there okay that's going to be the uh high price on that particular candle right there it's 45145 this candle trades to 4514 A5 exactly the same high when we have that but look closer we have relative equal high but we have it in multiple short-term highs that keep going higher if there's three highs they go up like that that's a classic three drives pattern uh there's a book I really enjoyed when I was in the 90s uh Linda rash and Larry Connor's uh Street smarts book um really nice little book I don't like everything in the book but I liked a few of the things that they talked about and it helped me understand stop hunts because I couldn't understand it as a developing student that why would the price want to go for those stops it didn't make any sense because the books that I had bought never really explained all that in in detail they just said trust this pattern of continuation or reversal pattern and the idea of stop hunts or raids on liquidity never really came up so it was an alien topic to me so when I started delving into the charts and started looking at it it helped me and the pattern that she and Larry mentioned in there was the three little endings pattern it sounds quirky sounds a little silly but it's basically the three drives pattern okay that means it's a swing High a higher swing High and a higher swing high so it's three times the market kept pressing up I like to see this pattern forming when there's an old high back here okay on any time frame it's Universal okay but if you ever start seeing these three drives up into an old high you don't have to see that third High take out the old High because what it's doing is it's already pressing into running out liquidity every time it creates a swing high and it starts to go down bears are trying to sell that and they're putting buy stops rating above the previous high and they keep getting taken so it's already building in liquidity and informed investors or quote unquote smart money will be already establishing short positions then the market breaks in one of the previous videos I talked about the pattern or the setup and I suggested not using a particular swing low that looks like it's been violated and why didn't that trade work out wouldn't that be a losing trade I want you to think about this idea that I teach which is displacement okay if you have a children's swimming pool okay if you have a children's swimming pool in your backyard and you fill it up and then you have an elephant just fall down inside of it what's going to happen the water's going to be displaced okay it's going to be an obvious displacement of that water rather simplistic analogy but that's what you're looking for in price when price goes above an old high and it trades down below it you want to see an obvious displacement you don't want to see it just dude like H well you know little lethargic run here that's not enough this is like that elephant falling into that children's swimming pool it's no doubt about it it really had a displacement when that occurs then you go in you start looking for the fair value G the low the high and if it trades back up into that then you can look for a short okay there's a process that you go through learning it and it's good that three of you were very critical about it but but trust me there's rules for reason and I'm not trying to hide failure because these patterns sometimes will fail you okay you'll read them wrong or they just won't work okay sometimes the market will have some kind of a news event that comes out or it just simply just rolls over top of it and goes higher goes lower that's a losing trade that's why you have to have a stop loss that's why you have to have good sound money management because if you don't have those things Murphy's Law is going to creep in and whatever can go wrong will and if you leave it open to the markets that determination how bad the Pain's going to be trust me you don't want that okay you want to limit that so now we have this previous High previous low now if we did not this is really important that you understand this part here if we don't start seeing these higher highs forming and it's just one steady run up then you anticipate a high like this to be taken out and it doesn't need to be taken out by much just trade above it and then you want to look for this energetic movement lower that's displacement where it's really animated so in other words it would look like when you're looking at your chart that's a little bit more pronounced because it went Above This previous High here you're looking at this one but as it's starting to move towards that old high remember 830 prior to that you're looking for what's this it down a swing High yes so it's trading above it here does it have an energetic break below that no it's just a very weak anemic move lower then you have another run higher here and then you have this Wick or tail come down and it quickly snaps back does that create a fair value Gap in that no it's not there yet then it goes higher here doesn't go above it matches that high but then now this High watch does it go below that yes a little bit here but it's a little anemic still but then look what we have here it trades up and then smashes down then the next candle here closes what do we have there's your fair value got that's your short and you could reach for the liquidity resting below that low that you would be identifying prior to 8:30 so sell side liquidity matching up with your short you sell you want to buy it back to cover that short well here's waiting sellers right down here in the form of sell stops bam hits it okay putting aside that you may not have seen this as a long entry okay maybe you didn't see this as a potential continuation of bullishness but look at these highs here what's resting above that now buy stops buy side liquidity and then what do we have here right before lunch hour it goes slightly above it and then trades down and then we're in that time of the day you don't Trade It New York lunch hour noon to one don't trade it okay do not trade it it can do a lot of weird things in that hour or simply do nothing and go sideways but either way you don't want to be a participant in that because it's just it's not usually a clean time of day for Price action so now here we have the high of the day and all the liquidity resting above here that would not have been tagged by this in other words stops are resting a little bit above that because there's a lot of people trying to sell short they want they want to see this thing go lower but we created a very important low last week and the market has already tanked a lot so it's pulling back up in the run that it created going lower on a daily chart so all these buy side liquidity pools here are going to be a reason for the market to want to reach up to that because you don't have to be a participant down here as a buyer you just need to know on the other side of lunch at 1:00 start watching and see is there an indication that this thing wants to go higher and as you can see all the buy side liquidity here was ran aggressively here but then the market trades right into the close aggressively bullish small little retracement here small little retracement here and then immediate run right into the close now obviously the market trades a little bit beyond that but this time of day expect whatever algorithms that you would expect to be driving price and price runs to pretty much cap the the majority of the volume that's going to be in that day so what I want you to think about is how the day is designed to have a morning move a lunch hour where you don't want to be trading and then the afternoon move go back through your charts and you can go back as far as you want the more you do this the better you'll get but I want you to think about creating your charts like this and then describing what the morning Trend was was it a bullish move was it a bearish move was it consolidation if it was consolidation prior to that part of the day in other words the previous day or the previous days was it bullish or bearish then because if it was bullish this is probably setting up another continuation higher especially if you start seeing these relative equal highs forming where it Paints the idea that this is retail resistance so Traders are going to think that this is going to go lower and it starts to build up a lot more interest in the form of buy side liquidity or buying interest at a high price even though those Traders may be framing the context of their trades as a short entry trying to make money going lower they're protective stop if they choose to use one it's going to be in the form of a buy stop and this is where it's going to be at so the Market's going to want to gravitate towards that especially if you start seeing the swing lows not the one in lunch time ignore that one you start seeing the swing lows that are forming every candle has a higher low to the left and higher low to the right if they start building up and every time they create a new one it's going higher that's a under pinning of the marketplace that showing accumulation it wants to go up because it wants to clean out all this here plus we've been going up for a few days on the daily chart plus the sentiment is everybody thinks it's been going down so they all want to sell short because they want to see a stock market crash but what they are failing to realize is we've already went down below a old low on the daily chart so now we're running back the other direction and anyone that's trying to sell short unless it's a real quick intraday scalp they're having their clocks cleaned so in the Aon there's a trend and one of the built-in characteristics of the afternoon is there's mechanisms that are built in that help this Market really accelerate into the close and if you studied the price action in your lower time frame charts you'll see that there's a repeating phenomenon at typically around 20 minutes to 4 and 10 minutes to 4 and 4:00 and it's all based on Market on close orders that's really what it is okay and the algorithms will start spitting out really really aggressive pricing and forcing traders to either cover or you know get out of their trades and usually if it's going up it really just ramps up and accelerates in that direction so while I really enjoy trading the morning session because there's a lot of volatility and excitement if you're looking for if you know what your daily bias is and we'll talk about that next week if you know what your daily bias is and if you know what you're looking for in terms of range expansion on the daily chart now what what I mean by that the daily candle do you expect it to trade higher or lower you're not trying to predict you know every single daily candle's close but you're trying to determine do you think that the daily candle you're looking at forming today or what would be forming tomorrow is it more likely to be expanding higher or lower if it's expanding higher in your analysis that means you want to try to trade with the expectation to find a trade in the afternoon based on the logic that was used in the morning so in other words think about what I taught in Forex the daily range okay creating a initial high of the day and the low of the day here now this is not the time of London but this would be like what I teach as a London low in a buy day for Forex this would be the low of the day then we consolidate and then we get the New York continuation and it runs in the same direction that the London session formed but this is not London this is all New York time so there's a little bit of adjusting that needs to be taken into consideration which is why I made sure at the beginning of the video I said make sure your charts are set to New York time over here it needs to be that okay and if you don't have it like that everything you're learning here if it's at your local time in your local time zone it's it's going to be a mess so you need to calibrate your charts on trading view to that and everything I'm showing you here is it's the same thing every day every single day same thing so back to the homework assignment I want you to think about outlining what the session was in the morning and then what did session do in the afternoon sometimes what you'll see is it'll be bullish in the morning and then reverse in the afternoon or it'll be bullish in the morning and continuation higher in the afternoon and you'll get like a measured move what's a measured move whatever the morning move was it'll duplicate that twice so if it moves up 200 points in the morning the afternoon could see another 200 points in addition to that and have a 400 Point range or we could have a consolidation in the morning session and then it Trends in the afternoon higher or lower okay and I want you to go through your charts and look at that on an intay basis do your charts like this and I know it's a lot of work but you want to learn how to do it right this is how you do it then study what the daily chart was showing days before when it had days that had these nice runs like this and yesterday and previous Friday so it allows you to help find these big moves where if you're looking at other like I'm not going to say this to try to be mean-spirited CU that's not my intent here but I want you to compare and contrast like if you look around at all the folks on YouTube and again this is this is not me trying to be arrogant I just want you to understand there's a stark contrast to what I'm teaching you here and what is predominantly shown in this area of trading okay index fatures you'll see Traders that'll get in here and they get in a price like that and then they're going to make a big attempt to worry about a move like that and they'll put lots of contracts on on and you know trade this and have a whole lot of hype and anxiety about whether or not it's going to move in their favor and worry about their stop getting hit and all this stuff and I don't want you thinking like that okay I don't want you thinking like that at all I want you to think about how if this day was bullish for you say you had the benefit of knowing that through analysis you felt that this was going to go higher okay if that's the case this swing low here first swing low any importance after 130 this is really important 130 I'm looking for swing highs and swing lows for the afternoon session that's what I'm looking for it's the same context that I use for the morning session I'm looking for swing highs and swing lows prior to 8:30 I'm looking for the first one okay I'm not needing to go back days and days and days I'm just looking for the first one it's not a complicated thing but at 130 that's usually when I'm wanting to start trading the afternoon that's the earliest but I'm preferably looking for a swing high and swing low to form at 130 why 130 because there's an algorithm macro that starts running at 130 that's beyond the scope of this mentorship but just trust me there is something going on that creates movement at 130 in the New York session okay in equity market so when that occurs all we're looking for or what I'm looking for is a swing High and a swing low and then that same basis of looking for a stop hunt in the morning like we described here I'm looking for the same thing here that's it same thing so now think about this I'm I'm thinking that these stops are in Jeopardy because it's too clean the level's too clean straight line edges in the market they don't tend to stay like that there's going to be a disruption the Market's been going higher hasn't it yes there this pent up aggression that this Market wants to go higher but it's seeing short-term resistance here here it tried it a little bit here and then retraced inside the lunch hour the algorithm reserved the price run until later in the day now watch what happens this swing low here gets violated right there see that That Swing Low gets violated right there that small little stop Hunt is all that's necessary that will start what is called a buy program a by program is when the algorithms go into the process of spooling spooling is where it just continuously keeps offering higher prices if it's a buy program it just keeps offering higher prices it does not matter what the volume is it does not matter and I don't care who you know who worked at at the exchange I don't care trust me when I tell you if you go through the charts you're going to see this okay look at the volume that comes in sometimes it'll be good volume and another like why is this happening right that's that's your signature that's how you know that this is being completely manipulated so if it's being manipulated doesn't it stand profitable for you to know what it's likely to do not if you're going know it all the time you're not going to know I don't know it all the time but these things tend to repeat and if they repeat a majority of time not every day but the majority of time if these things are in alignment if they start showing the same fingerprints it's probably going to pan out and then you can start doing long entries and then hold for the close don't get in here and try to trade these little Mickey Mouse moves and worry about them and over leverage and try to put more contracts on than your account can really weather because if you don't know what you're doing cheap leverage discount leverage can murder you can absolutely murder you and especially in these kind of markets they're very fast markets right now I'm loving it but it's very quick violent volatility and if you don't know what you're doing you can literally be dismantled very quickly expediently okay so inside this area the market creates a swing low runs through this low stop hunt so the stops below here what sell stops buy those sell stops I know it feels scary but go through your charts and you'll see many examples of this happening it's the same thing took place over here buy the sell stops that are resting below here and expect this level to be taken out consolidation through lunch at after 1:30 in the afternoon wait for a swing low to be violated and then rally what if you don't get a swing low that trades below it what do you look for well you look for a move higher that's sudden displacement higher then look for a fair value Gap if it trades back down in the fair value Gap you buy that there's your two patterns that's it that's the only two patterns you need you don't need 15 different gimmicky names okay you don't need Breakers you don't need an order block see how easy that is very simple strategy very very simple strategy you have a trade one way or the other and the logic has to be there for either one of them to form now I was not in the EM Min S&P today I was trading NASDAQ so let's go over to NASDAQ and I'm going to save time and not put all the lipstick on the chart I hope you can allow me that but here is 130 we have a swing low there and it's basically almost the same low as that one so what's happening here what's that it's trading down below it see that look further to the left what's that fair value Gap man it can't be that easy it can't be that easy these relative equal highs what's above that buy side liquidity okay watch I'm going to drop into a one minute chart scrub back here to 130 and I don't need to do 20 contracts or 10 contracts to do like a $20,000 day that's kind of like the flavor of the month right now and if you look at this low and this low here what are those they're relative equal lows so that's going to be viewed as what support retail support and they're going to buy those little runs here they're basically going to chase that so if you look at this through the scope of below this level there's sell stops and you think it's going to go higher like I believed it was going to go higher today I want to be buying those stops all right so say you're watching price it's Meandering through through through and then all of a sudden That Swing Low forms right there and we had this low here and we had this sudden drop down when you see that if you're watching it on a like a one minute chart that's going to look so Dynamic so aggressive if you're zoomed in it's going to feel like the floor has just dropped out but that's exactly what you're looking for to buy now you see fellas out there on YouTube You're Going To See by contrast there are folks out there that are trying to trade you know just a handful of ticks with a lot of contracts that to me doesn't make any sense but if that works for you did great okay but I want you to think about in comparison and by contrast what seems more logical for you to feel it's worth more to pursue in study and learning how to do something like that where it's risk a lot put a lot behind the trade and try to get just a little bit of a move or now this is a demo account okay but I did trade live today too but just for the purposes of teaching the content right there that low is the lowest candle it rallies all the way up okay and then right here that was a close there's a better way to do this if you know what you're looking for you can be very very precise about it you can be dialed in like nobody's business like it is unbelievable in terms of the predictable nature of these markets especially these markets because they're they're traded by a lot of Institutions and a lot of professional Traders the manipulation that takes place in these markets is still there but it's not as well vulgar or ruthless as it is sometimes in Forex the inbank markets man they can really really you know do you dirty quick and more fre frequently the Futures Market they tend to be a little bit more cleaner a little bit more predictable much more nicer in their delivery now there are times when reports come out or something you know unannounced comes into the world scene and causes volatility when that occurs then you'll get that noisy look to price action just stand on the sidelines wait for things to smooth out it may not be that same trading day it may require you a day or or maybe even a week let the markets go back into sync and then they'll start delivering very nice again but the the main thing I want you to take away is that you know showing entries like this and ex and stuff it's not it's not all that much of a big deal okay but it becomes a sticking point okay a stumbling block for people that want to try to learn how to do this because if you lay it in front of them they have to have lots of contracts to do something to be profitable in such a small little move to me it communicates that that person that's trying to trade like that whether it's the person that created the system or someone that's trying to learn the system they really have no idea how price works and how it books because if they did they wouldn't be trying to take these little tiny little micro out of the marketplace they would be trading like I'm showing you here so if you were to think to yourself hey I want to know what it's like to be in a move where I can be comfortable knowing that the daily range is going to unfold and I'm just going to submit to it well these markets offer that Forex offers it too but right now in the last couple months really Forex has been rather funky okay and because of that we have transitioned to index Futures there are times of the year where I teach index Futures Trading because they're predominantly more liquid and or if there's no real topic for me to teach to my paid mentorship group I'll say I got nothing for you for Forex and then I'll point to Something in Futures it may be a commodity market like last year I told everybody buy the gray Market say were're going to have a huge bull market boom they went up it's a matter of knowing how to navigate the price action okay but these markets here except for the sun summer months and that being like July and August those months can be a little uh hit or miss but the rest of the year they tend to be really nice markets so if you're looking to have your trading business framed on a asset class that is really nice it's professionally delivered where it's not like a bucket shop you know penny stock type Market it's these markets are really nice they're very systematic in the way they do do things and they repeat but if you don't know what you're looking for or understanding Behind These mechanics that I'm outlining here at the very basic level then you can obviously hurt yourself still so right away I'm showing you that there are times in the day that you want to be looking for setups you're not trying to do 25 trades you're not trying to do 30 trades you're not in there trying to Micro Scalp you're looking for the real moves in the morning and the real moves in the afternoon and preferably if you get 1 in the morning you don't trade in the afternoon go to a demo and practice there don't give the money back to the marketplace especially while you're you know you're new don't do that and I'm actually telling you not to trade with live funds but I know a lot of you like to see things that are traded with a live account like it's a real um account that shows entries and and things of that nature and that's the things I'm doing this year okay I'm not going to do it in 2023 I'm not going to do it forever okay I did it so that way my students can feel at ease about it because even in my in my paid mentorship group I don't trade live funds there because for my protection I'm doing what I'm showing you right here in a demo but I've been showing Live account trades this to approved it it works so hopefully you found this insightful and until I'll talk to you on Thursday be safe

all right folks welcome back this is episode six in our ongoing ict mentorship on youtube for 2022 and the market efficiency paradigm and institutional order flow will be our topic for this evening all right so how do we internalize price delivery first we do not trade patterns for patterns sake we do not trade indicator readings or momentum we look to enter longs where retail sells we look to enter shorts where retail buys usually when you hear me say something like that or someone that's been trained by me speak like that it sounds like well you know you're talking like you work for an institution you work at a bank you know you're you're trading retail too yes we are all operating through retail avenues to get to the marketplace what i'm teaching you is the internal dialogue of what we're doing we're looking at price we're not thinking like the collective that is commonly referred to as the retail trader because majority of retail traders lose they have a failed logic they don't have consistency they don't have well longevity so we want to try to think and engage differently with price that is opposed to the majority of what retail analysis concepts you whatever it is that you subscribe to as a retail trader you know all those things unless they're rooted in the basis of liquidity and overflow it's made up it's a religion and i'm not here to argue beyond that that's what i have come to to believe and that's how i operate and my results and the things that my students see speak for themselves we anticipate price seeking opposing liquidity okay so what does that mean well if you're looking at this diagram imagine if we could take price as a conceptual idea it doesn't matter what market it is but let's just say there's two camps there's the informed or smart money and that's represented by this small little circle over here and then there's a larger collective which is the speculative uninformed money there's a large influx all the time of new uninformed money coming in because there's a large influx of uninformed money going out because they lose their account they blow up whatever equity they have in your trading account it's gone because of lack of discipline and a flawed logic smart money traders when they look at the marketplace they're not looking at secret trading indicators okay there is no secret indicators just let me put that to bed right now now there may be traders that have tools okay that they like to measure price action with that's not like a stochastics it's not like an rsi it's not like a well anything you can find on a trading platform list of indicators okay those things are not reached for by informed money what they're specifically looking at is time and price the most important thing is time because time that is the most crucial element so time of day is vital when we're engaging price retail doesn't really have any understanding or affinity for time except for the fact that they have time now to trade because they're in front of their computer or they have time to look at their phone while they're at work and they're putting on trades okay that's the extent of time when it comes to a retail average trader time for a professional through the lens of smart money time is crucial because time of day there are specific elements in a daily range that really build the likelihood of volatility to come in and also when short-term reversals are likely to occur okay so i mentioned in previous lessons that there's algorithms that will start to gyrate and cause price to run at specific times of the day if you were watching the e-mini markets today you saw it happen at four o'clock that was one of the times i gave and it was relentless today smart money so that way i can make this real short and to the point smart money looks to cannibalize this group of trader so because they're typically wrong in their directional bias in their stop placement should they choose to use one because a lot of traders don't use a stop loss as a retail trader because they're afraid they may expect the market to go lower and they understand that the highs above where they're at if they're in a very small window of profitability unrealized profit means they're still in the trade but they don't have a stop loss in now logic dictates that they should have a buy stop in to protect their position in case the market screams against them at least it limits the amount of equity lost but they may look at an old high and say okay i understand that my stop should be above that but because of their infancy they have no idea where to put it above that high they don't want to put it too shallow because it might go up and hit it and stop out their trade prematurely and or they don't want to put it up too high and then it spikes through that reaches for them and then it reverses and goes in the direction they're holding so they take a big loss and get stopped out so those are the two conundrums that a retail trader falls in to that pitfall that trap and maybe you're nodding your head and smirking thinking man i was there a lot i know and i can admit back in the 90s 1992 1993 that was what i was doing all the time you know i just didn't know what i was doing and i was falling victim to myself in just infancy not knowing but the smart money traders are not looking at price with give me a pattern to trade off of you know a bull flag a wedge pattern or something of that effect they're looking at liquidity what is the underlying narrative right now in the marketplace is it bullish is it bearish is the day's daily range going to go higher but how's it going to go higher is it likely to go lower at the beginning of the day first to sucker traders and going short run out sell stops they can acquire long positions at and then rally going into the close or maybe into the afternoon and that would be the extent of their plan of action and how does that speculative uninformed money and its liquidity that it provides how can they utilize that that's the market efficiency paradigm it's efficient for smart money traders to view the marketplace in that perspective versus technical analysis the mumbo jumbo things that traders put on their charts okay and you can lock me in there too because the times where i'm trying to use the logic that i trade with and if it fails i've done something wrong i've interpreted price wrong i thought something was in price and it wasn't there and it rolled over top of it and there it is that's a loss everybody's going to have a losing trade okay but i'm not looking at price with patterns on the sake of just trading for the pattern's sake in other words just because i think i see a pattern there because there's a misnomer that goes around trade what you see well just like the trend is your friend that trend is not your friend when it's at the end and it's reversing okay so there's always a rule to the rule there's always an exception to every rule okay and that's experience but what i've hopefully done in this model so far and i promise this is the end of the boring stuff we'll get into the nuts and bolts i'm stripping everything down and placing components at their logical place and order so that way you can go in the price immediately you don't need 18 months you don't even need four months it's immediate i've received a ton of feedback and i appreciate all that that you all can go into the charts and see these things right away and some of you actually started trading it i'm not asking you to do that i'm not trying to inspire you to do that you need to study it more but that's how quick and different all this is okay this is not your typical ict you know the stale boring stuff this is the things that really work in the marketplace so with that in mind let's continue so i want to give a little bit more specifics about the fair value got that we have the rules what it looks like so that way you understand exactly what it is and where it forms because this is going to repeat every single time it's going to be the same logic that i'm gonna show you here okay do not try to fancy dances okay and try to turn it into some kind of a mentorship course and rename everything with your name and and don't do that okay just take it for what it is i already know people are going to try to take this and copy it and make courses out of it okay i've already given it to you for free if it helps you then god bless you okay all i'm asking for is just appreciate the fact that i've taken the time to put it out here for you so the bearish ict fair value gap this is institutional order flow and it's a pattern that you can see the order flow actually coming into the marketplace when you look at like depth of market okay or if you study volume profile that's a religion okay what you're looking at is data yes but your interpretation is a private interpretation it's what you believe there may be a lot of other traders that have a similar mindset about that very thing but simply because you think that doesn't make it true it doesn't okay so what i'm trying to do is take my students into the marketplace with a chart a time-based chart okay there's some out there that will say time-based charts are useless that's because they don't know how to use a time-based chart because algorithms the first element they operate under is time hello quants so we're looking at what does a bearish ict fair value gap look like well if you take a look at this diagram it's rather crude i know but you have a run preferably above some kind of old high so the first candle is the high and the next candle is the extended low that goes below it the third candle is another continuation candle but the main important factors are this it's a three candle formation the first candle's low has to be traded below on the immediate following candle the next candle has to trade with an extended low as well that went below candle number two but does not trade with a high that trades back to candle number one's low what that creates is this small little gap where one candle only traded from the range of the candle number one's low to candle number three's high so that little space that's occupied right there what is actually occurring there is price is only being offered on the sell side there so imagine if you're painting your wall at your home okay and you take your roller you put it in the paint and you put the paint up against the wall and you roll down okay at first the first foot or so there's going to be a an ample amount of paint delivered to the wall from your paint roller but then as you keep rolling down towards the floor what will happen you'll start seeing these little pockets that look really porous okay what do you have to do to fix that you just change directions and start rolling the paint roller back up the same place you roll down that's exactly what price does there's an algorithm that delivers efficient market delivery you can argue with me all you want you're not going to convince me i know it if you go into price action with that market efficiency paradigm perception looking for this characteristic in price i promise you you will never look at charts the same way again it'll unlock a lot of things we're going to move the matrix and neo finally sees the matrix as it really is in binary code ones and zeros he has clarity well that same event as silly as it may sound ends up happening when you look at price action when you start looking at it from this perspective so let's go back into that analogy with this between this candle is low and this candle is high we only have cell site offered so that's like taking the paint and applying it to the wall and drawing down with the roller but now as you pull down there's little pockets right in here between this candle's low and this candle is high where price has not been efficiently offered for buyers why how's that working well you have sell side being offered here because the market's delivering lower prices it's offering continuously lower prices between this candle is low and this candle is high to efficiently balance out that little inefficient area at some future time the market's going to want to trade back into that area when it does and you're bearish that's a short signal okay you can go short and sell there with the expectation it's going to start to move lower optimal formations of the bearish ict fair value gap will be found after a run into buy side liquidity so it's not a matter of going into charts and looking for this little gap all the time this model i'm teaching you on this youtube channel is meant for you to look for periods where price runs above an old high then it breaks down and then you look for this pattern this is what it looks like you're not looking at anything prior to this candle has absolutely nothing to do with anything except for the fact that we treated above and on high that's a very simple logic isn't it and the run above a single high or multiple highs like a double top okay either one of those fits this criteria so what you're looking for is a pool of liquidity of buy stops resting above these highs that's buy side liquidity smart money will want to trade up into that and go short they may not be engaging above the high they may miss it just like any one of us that haven't been ready to take an order and place it in the marketplace they may miss that this is their saving grace right here this pattern that's what smart money is looking for they're looking for that right there and then once they see that they go in either with their limit order mark it in something to that effect and get short and the stock would be above the high okay there you go short and sweet done that is exactly what you're looking for for a fair value gap so when you're doing your annotations on your charts this is what you want to be doing all your back testing label number one candle the number two candle is always going to be where the gap resides and then the number three candle gives you the lower end the upper end of the fair value gap is going to be the low of candle number one the lower end of the fair value gap is going to be the high of candle number three and the difference between candle number one is low and candle number three is high that's the fair value you got so the easiest entry would be trading just above candle number three's high you can put a limit order right there and be done simple don't have to worry about guessing where to put your limit order in it's right there place your stop right above can number one or you can put it above candle number two but while you're learning how to use this that may seem like a lot of range you want a lot of range when you first start out i'm assuming that all of you are brand new you may not be but i'm teaching it with that perspective in mind some of you that have been with me for a longer time you know how to reduce that stop and i know hearing that by some of you that are new you feel like you're being slighted oh you're holding back no i'm protecting you because i know already some of you already are going out there trying to treat life money and you may be reporting you're doing good but you don't know what you're doing yet okay just trust me you got to practice and do a lot of back testing then demo it then you'll get it the bearish market structure shift what does that look like conceptually well you have the market trading higher short-term little retracement then it trades above an old high or the initial short-term high that it trades above here and then it breaks down once that low is broken that's when the new trade idea is now being birthed you don't even know where you're getting in at yet until you go through this process i'm going to show you right now the market will see a price delivery of a rally above an old high or highs and then quickly shift lower that's this right here now the significance i'm placing on the term quick is linked directly to the term displacement okay it's got to be energetic it can't be a little lethargic little move it's got to show a real willingness to want to go lower and preferably close below that if it does that that to me is a little bit more significant whereas if we just go through this low a little bit like a wick and come back up um that to me is not all that convincing i want to see that it has absolutely displaced and then the candle closed and then we look inside this range here so when you're looking at market structure shifts this is all time frames so don't think this is just the intraday version of it but i'm specifically dealing with intraday so when we create that high that high down to the low that breaks the short-term low here so now we have that shift in market structure there right below that low that is the displacement low this is your displacement high so what's the big deal about that oh you're just trying to add some words ict sound smart that way don't you no it's conceptual ideas being expressed so what you have in between that range that right there you're gonna be hunting your fair value gaps because that's exactly where it's going to form don't take my word for it every one of your examples are going to have this oh don't take my word that's the only thing to believe go into your charts and you will be convinced of it in short order period so if you're bearish and you see price run above an old high then it breaks below the old high and takes out a short term low prior to that run above that short term low being broken draw that out in time that's your displacement low and the high is your displacement height so that range between here and here that's displacement how do you know it's displacement how it closes down here below that low is it just a real short little drop below it might have a fair value gap but it also might be likely to go higher and create another high so that's this is the secret to it here knowing how we trade below that and if it's energetic a lot of movement big a big beefy bearish candle that closes low below this level right there okay if we have that as soon as we have that candle form start watching to see if it creates a fair value gap in between this low and this candle's high or that range okay that's exactly where the fair value gap to sell short will form if there is no fair value gap in here guess what you don't have a trade you wait or go to another market because one of them is going to be there every single trading day okay every single trading day this pattern forms are you telling yes i'm telling you just like that every single trading day this pattern forms every single day long and short but you have to look for it with this process okay everything i teach obviously is reversed the same way so i'll just go through this a lot quicker because this is already becoming a longer video than i wanted it to be but bullish ict fair value gap again institutional order flow pattern and it's three candles formation the candle here is number one the second candle here and the third candle there candle number one's high that is the low of the fair value gap candle number three's low is the high of the fair value gap candle number two is where the fair value gap will be formed so that is your favorite value gap and everything you would expect to see in form of a market run below an old low or multiple lows for sell side liquidity once it starts trading higher and takes out a short term high that's not being shown here okay cause i'm showing you the pattern itself this is what you're looking for okay this separation between three candles that's the criteria you have to blend in the logic of a market structure shift that's bullish so what does that look like you have a market trade below no low and maybe go a low another leg lower and create a run into sell stops once that occurs then you're looking for a run higher that takes out a short term high and it closes above it with an energetic displacement higher once you see that then you have a trade idea being birthed you don't have a trade entry yet until you determine if it has a fair value gap where does that reside between the displacement high and the displacement low in between right before the market structure is broken bullishly and the low that ran into the cell stops that is your range this is exactly where you're looking for a fair value guy so in that range that's where your bullish fair value gap resides if there isn't one there you don't have a trade is that not specific and clear it's perfectly illustrated there's no ambiguity to it it's exactly the logic you're going to use going forward it does not change it doesn't mutate into anything you don't bring something else into it you don't add something else that some other educator has taken my stuff and twisted it up and try to make it sound like something new and they've created themselves no this is what you're supposed to be doing if you do anything other than this you're not going to get the results you're looking for and you're not going to find my ict fair value got okay all right so let's go into the price action you survived you made it here so here we have the 15 minute timing frame from today this is the e-mini nasdaq and this is a 15-minute timing frame this is where i tell you to start this is your bellwether chart naked chart okay pause the video and look and see if you see anything of any importance which swing high would you anchor where is there a stop run on buy stops when you're ready to listen to the rest of the video unpause the video some of you never pause the video alright so we have 8 30 marked here okay very specific right element of time 8 30 why because there's news that comes out okay employment data came out today so at 8 30 the market from that point on here look to the left what do you see what's the first swing how you come to right there is that hard was that was that complicated no very simple so this high here draw that out in time and you'll get this right here okay but watch with this run right there on a 15 minute time frame what do you do with it well you start stripping down from a top down five minute four minute three minute two minute one minute so once you have this level on your chart on a 50 minute time frame you drop down to your five everything's transposed from the 15 to the five minute you can see it trades above it here and the market starts to trade lower when it's trading lower in here you're going down into what the four minute here we have here is there a fair value gap in here yet nope there's one right there see that right there so we traded below this swing low there's a fair value got right there you can enter there right on this candle's high you can go short there what's the rules do you remember what the rules were you can put your stop above this here or the swing high there's a swing high right there candle number one or the swing high does it hit your stop no this might be more than you're willing to absorb but there's micros you're only trading two dollars per handle there it's not twenty dollars per handle okay or four ticks it's two dollars for each tick or 50 cents each tick so that's not a lot of money being risked there but i want to go down and really fine tune it so i'm dropping down through all the time frames five four three two one and if i'm being completely honest with you i have those charts all open at the same time across my desk so i'm constantly referring to all of them now you can do that cycling through rather quickly and just look for the form in the two-minute chart you don't have a fair value gap in here until there as well same entry and you can put a stop there as well and on the one minute chart we have the run here the break below the short term low here fair value gap straight up into that look how many times it gives you a chance to get in this candle that's one two three then it continues even lower so you're getting a really really tight entry there now some of you gonna say oh yes guys talk about hindsight i got you covered i actually went in and traded this today on trading view and you'll see me entering right here and writing down and taking out my exits below an old low but i'm going to also teach you how you can use the model here and use the exit strategy i use today for external range liquidity oh something new so let's go over to trading view all right so i'm going to kill two bursts of one stone here i don't use the replay button this is going to be the first time you've ever seen me use it but it's only for the purpose of teaching how you if you can't watch live data okay just use this i guess is the best thing you can i guess have as an alternative also i'm not sure if i mentioned this in the past but if you are going to tradingview.com and you're pulling up the symbol nqh2022 and you're going into a one-minute chart the data is delayed here and to be quite honest which i don't recall if it's 10 minutes or 20 minutes or i don't know exactly i don't remember what the delay was but i pay the four dollar a month subscription rate to get the e-mini data and i also have a professional account so i'm not sure if that four dollars a month is because i have a professional account or if it's just four dollars for anyone so you'll have to investigate yourself to see if that's something you want to do you don't need to have that data while you're learning okay you can use this function here so while i do have real time data because if i didn't you'd see like a little orange d up here letter d that would uh basically communicate to anyone that would see the chart that it's a delayed data this is live data and i have it scrolled to this morning for february 3rd 2022 and i have my chart delineated with the 15 minute high with that level and i'll show you this and then we'll zoom back out to a 15 minute chart you can see everything as it was because i'm going to show you there was actually a trading entered on this today but you want to have a vertical line dealing needed on trading the way you do that is simply go in here pick the vertical line and drop it right there at 8 30 and there it is okay so for the replay button and i feel weird just doing this because i just don't do it but i have to do it because i know students need this resource while they're learning okay but i i don't use this my mentorship that paid me to get education knows i never even use this okay but i'm showing you so that way you can back test and practice and look at price action in a way where it means something more than just looking at a static chart all right so it started at the 8 30 hour our line here is at that 15 minute high so what we're expecting is a run above that high okay and i'll keep it kind of quick i don't want to spend too much time with this so clicking the play button we're running above a short term high right here there's a fair value got right there hit that now watch it should sell off that's not what i want i want to use this high back here but if you're a scalper you could take that low out right there and that would have been a trade there as well but for the daily range which is much more significant i'm using the 15 minute high i'm bearish one day i'm expecting lower prices because we've already went up a lot on the daily chart so now if you're waiting all day you might look at this and say oh i missed it there's nothing for me to do don't think like that okay because the equity market opens at 9 30 stock markets start getting really busy and volatile around that time frame and we're coming up on it in a few minutes here and usually not always but usually the first run at 9 30 is opposite to what the real move you want to be doing not every time now here here's a 930 volatility look how crazy it gets okay it's creating a low with another low here so there's what what's building underneath that sell stops traders are being induced into thinking long trades go long go long go buy and get in there and go high buy low sell high right but it's it's sloppy in here but it's keeping these lows over here intact above these highs that's where my interest is okay so i don't have a trade until we get up above this level there and this is on a one minute chart okay small little shallow run we want something that's going to push through it no favorite value got filmed anyway okay i just paused it right there now look at this initial poke above that high that we've drawn a line on it went above it it went down yes did it create any fair value gaps in it no every candle overlaps there's no gaps there okay there's also no swing low taken out so there's nothing in here yet now we have a higher high running above this high and the high we're looking at on the 15 minute timeframe which is denoted by that horizontal line right there now we have the likelihood we if we're watching it live we're waiting to see does it break lower if it breaks lower where is there a swing low right there so if we can trade down below that swing low and as soon as it does that look in the highest high that forms and that low see if there's a fair value got the forms right there we went below it after taking out the high here's your number one candle the number two candle and the number three candle so there's your gap right in here so if it trades back this candle's high plus i don't know one handle or one tick maybe two ticks whatever whatever you believe is an ideal entry for you the easiest one to is just go one tick above that and removes all the doubt and there's no guesswork there there it is and where's your stop loss going to be above the high of candle number two or you can use above candle number one which creates a swing high okay whichever one you can afford and allows you to put the trade on some of you are going to look at to say oh this is too much risk okay then don't take the trade i'm just i'm giving you a model that works boom right there that candle if you had a limit order right there that would trip you in going short and your stop would have to be above here another one right there there's your second entry right above this candle here that's entering that's your limit order getting in go short same stop third opportunity almost completely closes in all that range right there see that right there if you see that live it feels like it's going to keep going higher because this candle at one time when it was at the high was all green and bold you need to trust and train yourself to look at this pattern as it's forming because once you see dozens of it occurring it changes your perspective you don't get scared in fact it's fascinating to anticipate okay it went here so now it's going to go lower so at that point right there at that entry from this candle's low to this candle's high where's about 50 about right here right so before we go any further where do we take our profits well you have a fair value gap right there right you see that same thing just going up candle number one it's high kindle number two and number three the low the range between candle number one's high and the third candle is low that's your favorite value gap so if you're selling short up here you can buy it back below here because you're below 50 of the range that it range from high to low you're at a discount down here so there's your first target remember those equal lows down here i was telling you about what's below that sell stops so you want to be taking profits here and or here this is ideal okay let's go back and watch the rest of it right there that's it these are minute candles so you're selling short here or maybe you entered on the first one here so that's minute one so one minute two minute three minute four minute five minutes six minutes seven eight nine ten eleven minutes and you have 10 20 30 40 50 we'll call it 60 we'll just call it 60. 60 handles in minutes okay that's literally over a thousand dollars in a matter of time that would probably be longer spent for someone that smokes a cigarette think about that if you are going to hold it focusing below these lows down here okay trust the bias that type of move right there is intended to upset traders and get out and if they trailer stop lost too short and aggressively they get knocked out right before the big move comes down takes out the lows down here so we're looking at right in here well let's look for 14 680. there it is now is that a lot of time getting short here weathering some of this you already took first partial down here so even with this pulling back your stop stays here you use the first partial to kind of like quench that desire to roll your stop don't do that if you do that you're probably gonna get stopped out because you don't have the understanding or the experience to know where to place a protective stop while it's being trailed once it takes this low out down here and if you want to hold on to position then you can roll your stop to here but not before why because you've taken out a significant intermediate term low this low that is high on a one minute chart that's an intermittent term price swing so it's taken out here but it's also a full target for selling short up here and getting out down here so what was the rough price level we used well let's look at the high here 14 we'll just call it 14 800 just for sake of the math so 100 100 handles is 14 700 and then we have the 80 fourteen thousand six eighty so 120 handles that's a significant price move using exactly what i've taught in this model now for those out there to say oh this replay button he uses the replay button that's the first time and make sure you remember the date because that's the first time you see me ever do market replay on trading view so if you look at this area in here i'm going to show you paper trading account oh i said we were going to talk about that here is the account history here you go the time put a shorter on let's take a look at where that actually occurs on the chart and i'll show you the execution right there two minis fourteen thousand seven ninety two and a half and i think i was reading that wrong down here because i was showing you the exit yeah close the short position yeah i read it wrong sorry so the entry price here selling short two minis at 14 792 and a half using the favorite value got holding on to it first partial here fourteen thousand six seventy five and then the limit order i had here was fourteen thousand six forty seven so how does that look on the grand scheme of things getting short here with that logic below the cell stops down here and in the limit order there and hopefully you've got something from this and you've seen that there is obviously more to it than just fluff it keeps repeating how many examples have you seen already since i started teaching this it's there and these are the two this is the first uh order covered and this is the second one okay don't look at this and say oh my gosh he's got 52 return and one day on first trade that's nothing that's nothing but i don't want you thinking that's what you can do okay don't think that please don't think that at all all i want you to do is practice on this logic it's a simple process so now in closing i revisited the idea of this high to that low that's your range okay if you put a fibonacci on that man i tell you i wish i had this stuff and i was coming up god coming in here for free look at this so we have 50 that's your equilibrium so everything above that price level because this low to that high that's our price run and 50 below it is discount so there's your little fair value got right there you see that that right there that's your target going short there but this is internal range liquidity because it's internal relative to this low and this high that range so it's in the middle of that range which makes it internal range liquidity what is the stops below these lows down here external range liquidity so partials internal range external range your trade very simple logic isn't it is there a lot of moving parts did i confuse you simple isn't it you may still have questions because you may be entirely brand new to charting and trading that's normal but by practicing and following along in this in this video series it's an ongoing mentorship it's not going to stop next week okay this will help you understand but i have to give it to you in bite-sized pieces because i give you too much you know it's not going to be meaningful to you but the logic hopefully even if you don't understand what i'm drawing you to in your own chart like you can't find it yet on your own chart i'm showing you exactly where it forms and is every example i've shown you happening in the time of the day the same way each time and is it performing as i taught it yes that's a model that's a trading plan that's an executable idea that you can go in and engage with a demo account and over time you get good at this you determine what you want to do with it i'm never going to say go and trade live money with it but i already have people already that have been trading for a while they're a little bit more versed than some of you if you're brand new it's okay but traders that have been doing live fun trading for a while this really resonated with them and they could see it and it wouldn't enter this week and they were catching trades real trades and like i said i don't want the credit for that but i already know this stuff works it's sending me emails telling me that this is amazing and it's great please don't do that you don't need to do that i already know it works i'm giving it to you so that way you can be fascinated by it okay this is just one model of dozens that i have and this is the stripped down version so hopefully you find insight and obviously you know benefit from following it and if you don't you know i'm sorry i didn't scratch that itch for you i'm sure if you study other things in my youtube channel you'll probably find something else that tickles your fancy until i talk to you next tuesday enjoy weekend and be safe

all right folks welcome back this is the seventh episode for the ICT mentorship on YouTube 20122 this lecture is going to be dealing with daily bias and consolidation hurdles all right folks we're looking at the daily chart for the NASDAQ and if you're looking at trading view under the NASDAQ selection so it's the continuous contract that way it makes all the candles look nice and crisp and you don't see any spotting so right away if you're looking at this you should see this run on price taking out buy side liquidity see all these relative equal highs here ran above it then broke below a swing low created what here got trades up into it now where is it going to trade to this low to this High midpoint there's a gap right there and then you have the old low sell here aim here or here and it runs it out now this is important obviously it sounds like well you know you're cherry picking in imp pack old moves okay that's how you learn but think about what's happened on the daily chart we traded below this low we've taken cell liquidity out of the market Marketplace so with that it's likely to retrace back up into the range what's the range this High to that low but look closer see how we have this nice energetic run look how many down closed candles we have here one two three four lot of movement there so I'm looking at this high and this low and I'm trying to get a range for where we are at present so once the cell side was taken out here it's likely to retrace back inside the range of this high and this low we've seen it come all the way back up it went to a premium Market which is above equilibrium here and then we went down below to a discount bounced off of the old low here then we've Consolidated around equilibrium now when you have this condition it can make it very difficult to get a true reading on bias okay so there's times when even me as ICT I don't have a good clear read on what it is I'm looking for so I have to demand more price action and more information or Intel as I like to call it based on what the Market's going to do right after the open at 9:30 in the morning New York time for disclosure in my own paid membership I mentioned to them that I felt that this was a likely area where they could probably take it down there and sweep that area whether it goes lower or not it's irrelevant but where we were here to here that's what I was expecting some type of move last night for Tuesday's trading okay so Tuesday's trading the 8th of February 2022 going into the marketplace I was anticipating something that would be bearish that's going to be useful to us when we go into lower time frame charts because I'm going to show you what I had to deal with this morning and how I had to overcome that this is something that if you're using these Concepts and practice with your demo account you're going to have these same conundrums and you have to find a way to overcome them and I'm just going to suggest this to you here but before we go into the lower time frames I want to teach bias okay so if we had this setup on a daily chart Market structure has a shift lower we trade up into a fair value Gap until we get down to here and here each day I'm anticipating lower prices so my bias is bearish now every single day is going to be a down Clos candle but I'm going to hunt intraday price action with that in mind if I'm going to take a long it would be counter Trend to that bi my Leverage is going to be dialed back so let's assume for a moment that the account that I was trading with would allow me to trade 10 contracts 10 contracts would be the maximum I could trade so if I'm Trading with the bias which would be bearish during the run from here to here and here then I'm going to look to utilize the maximum leverage that I can have without overleveraging by based on a fixed percentage basis like I like 3 and a half% I'm not telling you to use 3 and a half% you should be risking less than 1% about a half percent or a quarter percent because if you don't know what you're doing there's no reason to be putting High levels of risk behind a move if you don't know what it is you're doing it's going to create toxic thinking bad habits and you're going to be afraid to execute based on the results you're getting so you want to be indifferent to the results that in the beginning is important by having a demo account using very very low leverage if not deleveraging okay and I'll talk a little bit about that when we get into money management but that's not this topic so from this high down to that low each day I'm going in with the expectation that it's going to likely set up a sell scenario where I can get short and hopefully buy back at a lower price count how many up dayss or green Candles there are from this high and this High down to that low one two real important so the delivery by the algorithms are spooling that means prices expanding and going directionally one way when that occurs there's going to be times where you have an up closed candle that may be a day that you tried to go short and maybe you've lost okay no big deal same thing going into the next day going in for looking for shorts next day same thing same thing and then here it opens and trades down below the low and has a huge expansion move and then comes back above and that's it and closes on the near the high of the day or midpoint of the the body in this area here is there a lot of up closed candles during that bias being bearish no you need to get over the concern about being right every single time you need to put aside also the idea of perfection because you're not going to have it perfect you're not going to get in perfectly you're not going to get out perfectly you're not going to have the perfect amount of contracts you're not going to have you know the perfect asset in other words you may be trading the NASDAQ and the e- mini S&P has a little bit better run and delivers a little bit more highly unlikely but vice versa you get what I'm saying so you're you're always going to find reasons to be wrong Embrace imperfection embrace the idea that you don't have to know everything you don't have to be right okay being right is not equivalent to being profitable very important factor there so with bias in short you're looking at your daily chart to get a read on where it's likely to go to next where's the price going to draw is it going to draw higher to an old high is it going to draw down to an old low and until it gets that higher low you stay with that bias okay so it's a quick down and dirty way of interpreting price action for daily bias but the focus that I've taught that are hung up on daily bias really what they're trying to say is and this is exactly what they're getting at but they can't either articulate or they just won't be honest with it or me what they want is tell me how to get the high of the day when it's bearish and how to get out at the low and get all the move and never take a loss and avoid when it's going to be a day that goes against me where I feel comfortable now that might sound extreme and maybe some of you that have issues with daily bias are thinking to yourself that's not me I just want to know when it's going to go up when it's going to go down I'm telling you if you strip it down that's what you're trying to do you're trying to demand that I give you some magic bullet that's going to give you the absolute highest high and the lowest low on the bearish and bullish days so that way you're trading perfectly I don't trade perfectly no one trades perfectly so you have to have this embracing of the gray area in the marketplace that gray area is where things aren't always so clear but because of experience you've had in the past seeing things unfold the way they hopefully would if you've been trained properly then there's nothing to fear even if you do it wrong and you have a adverse reaction or result to taking a trade using the logic that you're training with there's no reason to be fearful because one or two or maybe a small string of losing trades does not in any way shape or form diminish the effectiveness of a model if it's based on Sound Logic so you're going to utilize the daily chart to determine whether or not the next candle is going to be likely bullish or bearish between this High here in the midpoint of this low to high I'm expecting down closed candles that would equate to a bearish bias it doesn't mean that I can't take a long entry it just means that if I do take a long entry in day I'm going to do it with far less leverage and if I see a setup that's bearish I'll use or consider using not always but I'll consider using my maximum risk which is 4 and a half% but I like to see trades that I feel comfortable with with 3 and a half% and until we get down to this low and underneath it that means it's likely to reverse RSE or consolidate and we have a retracement back in So once it starts doing this and it's hanging around equilibrium it gets very difficult even for me to determine a bias so what does that mean no trading no it just means that you have to rely on these smaller time frame intraday charts and just simply look for liquidity pools so you're going to trade intraday volatility running old highs running out old lows being a lot more nimble and like a surgical strike you you take your handles or your points that you're trying to get out of the marketplace and then run you don't try to overstay your welcome so let's go down to a lower time frame all right so we have the 15 minute time frame and we have our 8:30 in the morning crosshairs here crosshairs are the vertical line that denotes the time that we start looking back to the left okay right here go to the left we see here this is our first low so we Mark that and right in here to first to the left is here we don't want to use this low by itself because it's inside of this candle so I want to use the extreme where's the liquidity going to be is it going to be above this or is it going to be above that it's going to be above this okay why why not that one and why this one keep looking left what do you see over here see that these are relative equal highs what does retail Traders see that as resistance so they see it going up to here stopping and going lower they see it going up to here failing to go up here so now they think this is a really strong resistance level and it went lower look at that then the market showed how that level is real resistance by going right through it but this would be a first Target here to reach for and if you want to use a longer term intraday Target would be back here because to the left of this one is this one which essentially is the same then we have this one here okay so obviously with the benefit of hindsight you can see that we traded below that low here then we reversed and started going higher we took out this High here which I traded this I did not hold for this now the question is going to be is why didn't you hold it for that one ICT well if you look at the range from this high down to the low over here about midpoint is just above this high right and we have this little imbalance right there so whatever I'm teaching you in this mentorship I'm looking for about the midpoint and some kind of liquidity there's buy stops above that okay so we traded below I went along on that candle I'll show you in a live account trust me just hear me out I bought a rout up here and I took out on this candle here I got out on that high now I could have held it but to do so would be painting the picture that you can do this and take down these types of Trades all the time and the reality is you're going to require a lot more time to develop than you probably think it will require one of the things that happens when I have students come under my tutelage is they have been fooled by listening to people talk about the left side of the chart all the time and they can't execute on the right side and it is useful in the beginning but if that's all there ever is and if your educator can't trade on the hard right edge of the chart it kind of makes you feel well either a false sense of security or a false sense of confidence that quickly gets evaporated when you trade with a live account or creates analysis paralysis and I have a large body of students that are lumped into one of those categories they've been utilizing some other concept or approach or they call it SMC smart money Concepts and they'll think to themselves that you know this is what's going to have to happen in the chart and it isn't because they're lacking narrative so one of the things that I'm teaching in this mentorship in my paid mentorship is how to view the marketplace from a narrative standpoint what's the logic why should the market do what it's doing it's not enough to see how a low is taken out and the expected to go higher or a high taken out and the expected to go low there has to be some greater context behind it and that's what I gave you in the beginning of the video now on the two-minute chart why the two-minute chart well that's for your homework you go through the five minute the 4 minute the 3 minute the 2 minute and the one minute chart I'm going to utilize the two-minute chart because this is what I was using today for my own analysis okay all right so you can see how we had the old low here we trade down below it and this 10:04 I'm actually highlighting that candle right there the reason why I'm using that candle's low and taking the screen capture there so I want you to see the low candles price okay so that's where your stop would have to be just below that maybe one one tick by going long in here based on the logic I'm going to start to outline here the market trades below the old low trades below it rallies above but does it trade Above This short-term High yet no then it goes down once more below the old low but not below this low here then it turns and goes higher what did I see in this chart that allowed me to go long in here what did I see nothing I didn't see anything in this particular chart I saw it in the S&P before I leave this chart I want you to think about how that high was around this High here that's where it could reach for 830 we're right here what's the point of expecting to go above that not much we want to see some kind of a protraction so the market yes it went above that short-term high and then went lower than that low yes but Watch What Happens it trades below it comes back up and look at all the volatility and the sloppiness inside this area here then the market starts to Rally so the draw in liquidity is going to be here it took out cell side here so let's look inside this price action and see if there's any details that would lead to a run into that we'll call it the 44.95 level okay so the two-minute chart this is what I was using the market trades below the old low as we see here I apologize to screenshot I wish I would have had these things on it but you can look at your two-minute chart on trading View and you'll see this a little bit more clear I apologize but this low C it's high then we have one candle up the next candle is low there's your fair value Gap that's the run in here so we have displacement low and displacement high is there a market structure shift bullish yes it trades up above it and you look for the fair value G is there one in here no anything in here no how about here no it's closed in with this Mo move down here but we have this so we trade down into it here and 1036 that candle forms that's a long in S&P now compare that with this fair value Gap in the S&P we traded below the old low we took sell side out we have a shift in Market structure on the S&P these averages tend to move in tandem so that means they generally move in the same direction so I'm looking at the Dow even though you don't see me trading it I'm looking at it I'm also looking at the S&P even though I'm favoring the NASDAQ because its volatility and its movement is more than the S&P other Traders might be fearful of the volatility say I don't want to trade that it's too fast for me I am loving this because I know how to trade I can work within that volatility because I know what I'm looking for I know the signatures the algorithm is going to put out so until I get these signatures I have to wait or put leaders into the marketplace which is what I'm going to show you when I show you my Live account results today but at 10:36 let's go back up to the NASDAQ we don't see any fair value Gap in there do we nope but we start to see NASDAQ turning so I went in Long in close proximity to this order block okay I went in at 14,505 that's inside of this order block so I'm trading close to it now I promised I wasn't going to teach order blocks that much in this mentorship and some of you have been leaving comments oh I'm not into this now because you're not teaching order blocks okay go watch something else I'm going to teach it the way I want to teach it okay it works and you have to get yourself acclimated to how I'm teaching it or don't watch okay I don't mean to be rude but I'm not taking suggestions on how to teach you so if we are expecting a fair value Gap to be a launching point for the S&P and these markets generally move in tandem I don't need the fair value Gap in the NASDAQ because I'm utilizing the S&P as my indicator what did I just say the word that should not be spoken indicators yeah even though I don't have them plastered all over my charts like graffiti you can see the candlesticks in my charts you can see the logic you can see how the markets run for liquidity there's nothing hiding or masquerading price you can see it it's clear you need that you need to be able to read the story of price and not the story of indicators so the logic is that S&P low in here was trading down into an old fair value Gap over here in its price swing but there is no fair value Gap in the NASDAQ see that now let's go back down into the S&P even my own paid memberships learning something tonight I should have charged money for this one oh ICT fair value Gap trade down into it there that's a long for S&P but I don't want to trade the S&P so I'm going to use the timing of that candle for my long entry on ndaq trading what's not in the chart hint hint nudge nudge so Market rallies and it trades into that short-term high that was seen on let's go back up right here so again just roughing it around that 4496 449 we'll just call it 96 4496 and that would be right in here bang hits it sweeps it accumulat some more and then rallies even higher taking out that longer term old high all right what gave me the confidence that this was turning here well let's take a look at the three averages together if you look at how the Market's trading low here on the Dow this top chart is the Dow futures the NASDAQ futures is in the middle and the S&P is at the lower end here so it's Dow NASDAQ S&P during that decline in the NASDAQ and the S&P look what the Dow's doing it's saying nah I'm going to sit this one out boys it's not willing to make that lower low where NASDAQ did S&P did when you see that right there and here's an important thing you anticipated already you're not looking for this this is what some of my students when they come into my mentorship they see this pattern they think oh it's diverging so it means it's going to go the other direction no this is something that confirms an idea that you had already established before price does what it's doing real time what does that mean you're already looking for a reason to go higher so that means you're looking at an old low does it trade below the old low okay does it have a shift in Market structure that's bullish yes we saw that in the S&P but we did not see it in NASDAQ no evidence whatsoever was in NASDAQ this morning with what I'm teaching you but it was listen it was in the S&P and no I don't trade the Dow but I utilize it like a indicator it's not plastered all over my chart I'm referring to it because I have multiple monitors I'm looking at my screens I have a screen that shows charts like this so I'm looking at the relationship of all three averages stacked over top of one another and if I'm looking at a period of time and an area in price action that maybe is going under accumulation for long positions this is what I'm looking for I'm looking for that little fingerprint of the algorithm what this is indicating is that Dow is unwilling to go lower than that low that tips off individuals that are looking for cracks and correlation okay Cor would be they are moving lower here here and here but they that correlation where they move in tandem together cracks here at a very important time right when the NASDAQ and the S&P are trading below its old low I get questioned all the time ICT how do you know it's going to be a fake Break below and old low and rally higher or or a fake Break above an old high and go lower which is what I dub a turtle soup now that's not the same pattern that is taught in Linda rash and Larry Connor's book Street smarts which is actually an excellent book I have my own interpretation of that which is very easy it's simple there isn't like you know I'm not going to teach their pattern and go buy their book and you support the authors but the idea is I'm looking for runs above old highs to set up a short position if I have the opposite of this condition here where maybe the Dow didn't make a higher High where the S&P and NASDAQ did make a higher high by itself it doesn't mean anything so many students over the years have simply went in there and said oh this is Magic I'm going to go just do that and I unwillingly did the same thing when I first started observing it I'm like I don't need to do anything else I just look for this and it didn't work out well okay I blew accounts yes I'm not ashamed to say it in the '90s I blew accounts doing this very thing here just looking for these diers and then I later learned that I have to have some kind of narrative as to why this would even form and to be honest with you I don't personally need to see this because I know what I'm looking for I already know that it's going to create this Divergence at the times I'm trying to buy but as a developing student you may not have that experience and there's nothing wrong with that and you may have you may been trading longer than me maybe you've been trading 31 years you know uh there's nothing wrong with that maybe you don't need this either but for a developing student someone that doesn't have a affinity for reading price action naked and not using indicators these are the best indicators you're ever going to have you don't need moving averages you don't need stochastic you don't need Fibonacci you don't need in that stuff okay you don't need it the only reason why I'm pulling a fib up is to show you where the midpoint is have you noticed that we haven't even talked about optimal trade entry none of that stuff I've stripped this down to the Chrome and it's beautiful is it not it's easy it's so simple it better be easy enough for my daughter to do it because if you can't do this one I don't have anything for but nonetheless I want you to think about how this pattern confirms the accumulation of long positions now let me correct those of you that are going to take this information and run out there and create your own videos or your own little courses or your own little mentorships okay because if you don't do this right you're going to hurt the people that are listen listening to you and I just don't want them to get hurt because of your lack of understanding what's going on the Dow is not going down because buyers are coming in that's not what's happening here that's what authors and book writers and people that don't really trade or code algorithms will have you believe this is an unwillingness to deliver to that low this is a macro a macro is something inside of an algorithm that prevents or enables delivery delivery of what price so the Dow is unwilling to go lower here okay by itself means nothing does it happen at the same time that the NASDAQ went lower yes at the same time the S&P went lower than that low yes okay so let's go back here's that old low prior to 8:30 remember algorithms run on time and price not price and time multi-level marketers the low that's the price yeah but you have to refer to time first what's the important factor of time 8:30 good to the left what's the first low right there boom so there's liquidity below that it trades below it here then wait do we get a signal that allows us to hunt what I'm teaching you on this mentorship there's a swing High it breaks it there so now Market structure shifted bullish look back through this price leg there's your fair value Gap oh but what happens if it goes down there and it keeps on going that's what your stop is for remember what I said earlier in the video some of you are so new okay your infancy as a Speculator and Trader is it's getting in the way of Sound Logic because what you're thinking is there's a way for you to trade and never take a loss there's a way for you to somehow and this is nowhere near true that you could enter the market and your stop never needs to be placed because you're right because what you're saying is I'm afraid to be wrong that's a psychological barrier that you need to get over because I'm going to show you my Live account and there's going to be some negative numbers there those negative numbers sometimes are premium payments for me to get more Intel okay and with that let's go into the continuation of this all right so here is my Live account and I did some trades this morning I got to my desk a little late this morning couldn't focus I had some expectations I wanted to see it Go lower I told my paid man ship last night that I prefer a move lower uh we got a really sloppy opening which is really characteristic of the 930 opening a lot of people tell you don't trade the 9:30 opening it's scary it's too much volatility I actually don't mind it because I'm actually putting sometimes a order in to get a feel for what it's doing now right away if I just show you this chart and don't give you the context behind it you're going to hear people or they're going to take my video and they're going to do all this armchair quarterback after the fact it's never been traded by them they're not doing a live account they're always playing in demo accounts blowing demo accounts they always have something negative to say about everybody else but they're not doing anything on themselves here's the context that's important okay back in the 90s I learned a lot of things from a Floor Trader that actually traded the S&P on the floor I also picked up more insights from Larry Williams about trading the S&P and also George and gel now George Andel had a really interesting concept when I first heard about it I kind of immediately discounted it I was like that's stupid and what is it well on the floor sometimes Traders would have just a disconnect they wouldn't have a read on what the price is doing so what they would do not just George but everybody on the floor would generally try to do this as well they would simply go in and buy or sell short one contract and just see what happens now for someone that doesn't know what trading is like never traded with life money or just now learning that's going to be like that's stupid if you don't know what you're doing why would you put an order in well if you want to know how the Market's likely to deliver put some skin in the race you'll have a greater feel for what it's doing when you put an order in it doesn't need to be a large order I'm only putting one contract in I can only trade one contract because of the equity I have in the account it's like 21 plus th000 to do one NASDAQ contract and it's Justified because of the volatility you could be up or down $5,000 in a session so you know discount brokers are not a Saving Grace so I put a order in two times I got to my desk late I wanted to dial in and the shest way for me to do that is just to toss a contract in now when I do that I'm trying to read what the price is doing against that order I'm not trying to pick a spot when I'm tossing that in there either now I understand how someone that would never have had any experience trading with real money would look at that and say that's dumb like that's somebody doesn't know what they're doing no you have no idea the benefits of having that it's like dropping a hook in water that you've never fished in you test it see I'm getting any bites here if I throw a short order in or if I throw a long order in I'm watching I'm getting a feel for what the Market's doing once that order's in there and I'm reading the reactions I'm not looking at the equity okay I'm not I'm not trying to get a tug-of-war sensation internally of making money losing money I'm watching how price delivers around that order is it easily moving away from that order or is it lethargically moving away or is it completely running against it that IM that immediate feedback that that feedback loop that it gives you as a a Trader because you have something in there that's worth something you're going to be more attentive to what price is doing and what you're familiar with with reading price than if you were just watching the charts paint the candles and it's something that is true when it comes to like learning with a demo account this is the limitations of learning with a demo because you can test the waters okay by throwing in a single contract and if that contract is is basically you know ran over for a lack of a better term then you know that your bias probably isn't in alignment with that order so if I'm trying to hunt the bigger move of the day I will sacrifice these initial little runs I'm not doing it all the time remember where we started this video we're in the middle of that range on the daily chart so technically it can go either side of the the range and take liquidity I don't know when going to sleep at night time and also when I'm doing videos earlier in the evening I don't know where price is going to be at at 9:30 in the morning New York time the next day I don't know that no one knows that okay no one's going to know that so when I build a trading plan or idea around what I would prefer to see I'm only looking for that the night before everything changes when we walk up to that 8:30 you know vertical line it gets put on my chart to show you now based on those ideas and the relationship of the information I'm getting with that initial contract going in at the opening at 930 I'm getting a read on price sometimes these trades pan out and it's profitable that's not the point and sometimes it creates a small draw down on the account that small draw down if you count that as a skill thing you're missing the point entirely okay if you can get yourself and Avail yourself some you know writings by George Angel invariably you're going to hear him or read him suggesting he's done this and Floor Traders did it as well when I started implementing it and I've done this with Forex too sometimes my students will tell you if we were all in a big Stadium okay and we were all like saying raise your hand if I said this or if I did not say that they would all raise their hand when I say sometimes I'll do this with Forex I just want to know what it's doing I need more information and there's no better feedback loop than to put something at risk in the marketplace CU you don't have anything at risk with a demo you can put a trade on with a demo but you're not really feeling anything from that you're only really drawing a connection when it's right when it's wrong it's just like well whatever I'm not I would have never taken that trade anyway so it's important you know the context here okay with that aside let's move forward so these are me putting in a leader in the market just to see if I can get a better read even though I want to see it going lower I'm not so sure with all this back and forth movement I don't know if it wants to run higher for reach for higher form of buy side liquidity or if it's going to run lower for that low so I tossed in two orders and you can see them when I show you the the history on my next slide but all this went away and then here's where I went short here and I covered basically then I went long right on that candle right there and what was my price ,55 A5 okay and I closed above that high remember the high was at 14620 here it is 14,622 and 3/4 so that's 117 handles I don't care about these little Mickey Mouse moves back here because that is a premium for Intel I'm going to make a small investment to get a better read on these types of moves here okay if I show you these types of charts or I make them available on the internet with no context behind them whatsoever none they would be trolled all day long and they would beat their chest and feel smart like they're saying something that means something they have no idea they have no reason to think that they anything they're saying is valid or true but I'm showing you the logic here okay this is not latency okay when I was doing latency tests that is me testing the feedback timing from putting a trade in how fast I can put orders in what type of slippage I'm getting cuz I have an algorithm and that timing is important for me because this account won't stay at one contract it'll eventually grow till I can do more so I need to know how fast I can ramp it up or is it going to take me a little bit longer term time frame to build it up before I can start pressing it harder everything I'm showing you in this account is All One Mini contract basis not more than one just one because of the leverage and the limitations of margin it won't it it prevents me from doing so okay as you can see it's $ 37,8 2315 and those trades that I showed you on the chart here is that history or whatever the somebody was posting uh show us the history you know it's not a live account unless you can show this area here well here's the trades I've taken for today here was the initial trade here okay you might look at this and say oh man I wouldn't do that pay $750 I'm looking for significant price moves I'm looking at trades that are a little bit more significant intraday because that's the model I'm teaching you now I can teach you a very high frequency type trading style that literally will blow the doors and beat the brakes off of all these supposed algorithms that YouTube's promoting and they won't have have these types of trades in them okay it'll be just real clean like 500 pip $500 runs or $300 runs on equity and then you get in and get out one contract so as you build this up you know 10 contracts it would be easy for you to do3 to $5,000 a day if you take the results I'm showing you here these are the trade results these are my two leaders I put in okay and I got a better feel for what the price was going to do I took the trade here this one here once we got closer to the actual setup around on 10:30 1036 candle these again I was testing whether or not that there's going to be a run now I'm sacrificing this and a little bit more of my starting Equity to get that information because I know if I get the right Intel I know if I'm buying okay I'm going to be buying then I'm going to look at the S&P like I showed you tonight the pattern the setup remember what I was telling you at the beginning of this mentorship this pattern forms every single day but you have to look for it it may not be in your asset it may not be in your particular Market but it exists all of these markets move like boats in a in high tide and low tide all boats rise in high tide all boats drop and lower with low tide so I'm trying to get a read on this environment as a whole not just my own asset class and since I'm trading the NASDAQ I'm not limiting my view or analysis to just NASDAQ there has to be some intermarket relationships okay and I'm combining markets that I'm not even trading like the Dow and the S&P but I'm using the feedback that they're providing me in terms of intermarket relationships so that's what I taught you tonight intermarket relationships and using the consolidation hurdles like when you have a consolidation what do you what you do well this is what I do you know I'll throw a contract in there to see what it's doing and I'll get a feel for that I don't care about draw down because I'm comfortable I can go in and fix the draw down at the end of the year you're going to see that every single day in here there's draw down and I correct it my goal is no losing days now that's not something that you should have as a goal coming out of the gates as a new student I'm not saying that you're ever going to get to that point and I do have losing days but I'm not showing losing days predominantly if I have a losing day here or there it's probably been two since the start of this account I fix the draw down I know how to do that so when I was doing latency tests and I'm testing tdmr trade speed and how they can deal with my positions when I'm getting in getting out getting in getting out I'm getting a read on how fast they can fill me what type of slippage I'm having because when you start doing lots of contracts that's going to mean a whole lot more than just one contract but one contract as you can see here I want to say this real quick and get out of the way um the profits and loss category right there that little tab it's at $ 13,926 that is not a lot of money folks it's not but it's 51 plus per now in two weeks of trading two weeks well two weeks in today days now a day say two weeks and one day so two weeks one day 51% now it's one contract if I was trading with 10 contracts we would be in some serious money then right you start paying more attention to it then right 13,000 almost $14,000 isn't that much money but what happens if you start doing that every single month I'm not suggesting that you can or will or promising that you will but what happens if you do would you make a living on that I'm just asking I put a poll on my community Tab and I asked everyone that would read it is 20% a month return is at a respectable rate of return and if you look at the results it's predominantly yes the other answer was no it's not enough for me now I know there's a lot of trolls that you know like to watch me they'll put whatever the expected adverse choice would be they'll choose that one okay okay but I'm sure there's some of you that think because your first you know impression about trading is everybody gets rich and nobody loses money and everybody gets Lamborghinis in the first three months and it's just great you know nothing nothing bad can happen it's all up from here and I've never been a mentor like that okay I've had very nice flashy things but I don't try to promote that idea I teach you this is going to take a lot of work but the work and the things that are real about this industry and how you're going to have to get like I'm teaching you T night what causes me to get clarity cuz sometimes I don't have it I don't know is something I say periodically and not knowing something is not ignorance it's not an absence of skill it's honesty and you have to be honest with yourself and you cannot assume that you're going to be coming into these markets being perfect because perfect is not something that exists in trading it does not exist there is never going to be someone that's perfect you're in this industry to do what make money that's it if you're in here for any other reason I'm in here to impress my dad impress my mom my girlfriend boyfriend husband whatever old gym teachers that's the wrong reason because you're doing things from an emotional high and when you have the emotional low it really hurts and you need to keep yourself focused on why you're doing this your you're doing it to make money to improve your financial condition like I mentioned before I start this mentorship I believe that there are hard times coming ahead and you don't need to make $144,000 in two weeks you don't need that but if you make your car note for the month or if you make 50% of your mortgage or rent payment every month with something like this and I'm not saying or promising you can but think like that let it evolve from that when I was a young man and I said this many times in my uh videos and I have some people in this uh mentorship that are watching that they don't like when I do these types of Rants and things and they say oh stick to the topic blah blah blah get to the point this is the point okay because you're going to if you're not trading with life money right now inconsistent you're going to have these things come up in your own thinking and they're going to be barriers so what when that happens you're going to be wanting to email me okay or you're going to wrestle with it and not know how to deal with it when I first started back when I was 20 years old I'm looking at the market thinking if I can get to the point where I could save $1,000 a month by the time I'm in my 40s I won't need to work now obviously you I didn't factor in inflation all that stuff but a million dollars by 40 you know that was enough for me to get to work and focus on learning how to do this contrast that with what you see on YouTube today follow my signal service join my mentorship I made $60,000 in one trade here's the proof here's the withdrawal here's this here's that that is not something that is sustainable and it's such a wild unicorn that just pops up once in a while you don't see these people pulling out $60,000 consistently every single week that's not happening okay but I'm pulling out $6,000 a week consistently now that's not a lot of money it's not but I'm quite confident in saying that I think that the majority of you and I'm talking the high 90% of you could live pretty nice on $6,000 a week will the market continuously offer me $6,000 I don't know I haven't traded the indices in a long time but I traded these markets 30 years ago okay and I know them so I'm not scared of them I'm not scared of the volatility I love it but if you look at the relationship ship of how these negative trades give me Intel they give me Insight because I'm trying to get a read on the next swing on that daily chart these are all small little Investments on me getting a better read on that see you think that your trading accounts never going to have any of these in them when these are to a informed Trader someone that's seasoned that knows what they're doing they'll invest in their own Trading think about what I'm telling you you're investing in yourself to get more information that you can't collect just by watching the price action so you got to get a closer feel for it and you invest and you put something in the marketplace now there are trades and I've mentioned this uh I'm not sure which video it was in the mentorship but I did one and they were losing trades they were they were wrong ideas they were absolutely wrong ideas not all of a losing trade record is errors and that's how it's important because if you just look at somebody's you know trading statements or or well yeah their positions and and their statements that's not going to give you the context that would be required like I could look at someone's statement and say okay yeah they're making money but in reality unless I look at what they're doing on a chart they could be lucky they could be just getting lucky and this today was me investing in trying to get a feel for what I think is going to happen on the next few days worth of data and I'll throw in a couple trades where it doesn't matter to me if I'm losing and sometimes when I do this they're winning trades but they're not meant to be winning trades or losing trades it's just me getting a read on it now when you do a micro account okay it wouldn't be this much money and you may not trade with this style this I know many of my students don't do this because they just don't think it's a worthwhile investment but those same traders that are under my toist are not capturing 100 plus handle moves in these indices either so it's a tradeoff okay what is it you're trying to do what are you trying to accomplish I'm not trying to get 10 handles you know on a lot of contracts and scalp scalp scalp okay I know what I'm looking for and this this tab over here where it says profit and losses I don't care how much money I deposit in the account the broker will never put that money in that tab so when you read people making comments on the internet and I have a few of them in the in the previous video that I mentioned and showed today where I was showing my Live account logging into in the whole show they said that I'm adding money and this is reflecting the additions and that just proves that these people have no idea what a live account looks like they've never seen one in their life no broker ever would ever reflect deposits in the profits and loss category that would never happen and this is absolutely profits and in organizations like the cftc would literally come after me or anybody else if that wasn't real money I'd be breaking the law by saying it is real money that's real profits right there okay these trades here I cleaned up all of this with that trade right there okay but I I want to give something that I think and believe that is realistic my int intentions are not to run this account up to a million dollar because I don't think that you learning from this YouTube channel that that is realistic can some of you do it well the sky is not the limit okay I've on record many times saying that I have students that do very very well I have students that don't make money at all now you might be an exception I don't know that you may believe it I don't know okay but the things I'm teaching on this YouTube channel I have faith in that's the only thing I'm showing you here I'm not saying look what I can do so therefore you can do it too I cannot promise you that you're going to get the same results in fact I'm promising you that you won't get the same results as me okay but I try to trade this account with the expectation also that I don't want it to be consistently over and over again where it's just too good to be believable because I want you to be able to see these statements at the end of the year and look at them and refer to them and say you know what there's these times in the market in certain months and certain days where there was draw down in this account and it came out of that draw down and look where it ended for the year look where it ended for each month that is tangible real world help when you feel like if you have a losing streak or if you have losing trades and you look at someone that's been able to use the logic that I'm teaching you and still correct it now I can correct the draw down intraday because I know how to trade very well I'm not bragging it's just the facts if I know what I'm looking for whatever draw down I have and I can correct the intraday draw down that I've had on the chart if we look at how the market can give us these opportunities and you can see that this trade here there's that entry at 14,505 and a half right there 14,622 and 3/4 right here that was the sell that was the exit here's the commission costs here's the fees and here's the commission that TDM trade takes out and here's the return on that one trade 2345 $2,345 that cancels out all of the leaders I put in to get a feel for it and I pocketed $1,100 for one day for a short amount of time I could have held it I could have done that using what I'm teaching you here but I'm trying to teach by example so that way you don't look at me do unrealistic things that you can't do right away do I believe someone that has put a year into trading and studying what I'm doing with this mentorship can trade like this I personally believe yes but does that mean that you are all going to do it no if I didn't believe you could do it I wouldn't be up here doing it okay the logic is being shown to you I showed you in the charts how I use the S&P to time my NASDAQ trade and here are the actual history this is this is it okay I got asked Today Show this okay here it is do the numbers here add them up and then add it to that profit and look at the video I just posted today and some of you going to say oh this is a you said uh photoshopped pH phoshop thing because it's on your PowerPoint I do PowerPoint because I'm not having to worry about hiding my user number because if I hide that then you can't see all the the other details down here I think it's what turns off so I want to keep everything so you can see it so it just allows me to not worry about it but nonetheless I want you to think about how daily bias is not an everyday bias that's going to work in your favor some days I go in I'm expecting like last night I preferred to see the market go a little bit lower and it didn't deliver so I had to make adjustments and then I caught myself on the right side of the daily range exiting where I teach you getting in where I teach you right there there's logic it's that's the proof okay um there will be days where I try to do this and I'm going to have a losing day it will happen I will not be able to corrected it will be a losing negative day when that happens the first instance that that happen s I'm going to show you it okay I'm not trying to hide the losing days but the trader in me the person that is ICT I refuse if I have the capability I refuse to let my negative day stay negative at the close now you might look at that as oh well you're you know you can't accept the losing trade and you're trading emotional that's nonsense this is someone that's got three decades of experience and I know how to fix it so if you knew how to fix it wouldn't you do it right so again everybody's going to have an opinion and everybody's going to have a way of thinking how they need to be taught but I've been doing this for a very long time and I'm not going to change my style so the order of which I'm teaching it the topics I'm talking about the way I'm showing it to you in the charts that's how I'm trading I'm putting the trades on based on that logic so that way you can see I have faith in this you may not have faith in this you may never take these trades you may never ever put any effort into learning them you're just watching this like it's a Netflix binge watching scen you scenario okay that's cool but this is something that is transferable I can do it it will repeat to answer your questions I'm getting a lot of comments also and I'm going to close the video here the algorithms are not going to change because ICT is teaching teaching you how to navigate with them period why am I trading these markets when I'm supposed to be the Forex Guru well if you look at Forex Forex is going real quiet it's sideways so I'm going to trade this Market also as a compare and contrast I've been doing this Market a lot longer than Forex again I started with these markets here and bonds which when we get into uh May and June I'll probably trade some Bonds in here as well give you some tips on on how that market Works a little bit too but hopefully you got something from this I was a little all over the place but I wanted to be relaxed and and communicate a lot of things that were coming to me by way of the comment section I appreciate all of your comments I appreciate all of the feedback you guys are giving me um just so you know I know some of you are probably leaving these sweet Sugar Rush uh comments and really really lavishing me with adoration I'm not trying to put those comments I always accept one comment for each video as a way of you know saying I liked your comment you know I think that's a a significant comment that I think the community would appreciate not just oh this is you know loving ICT um I appreciate all of that but just know that those types of comments are never going to be allowed to be shown um I I'm holding all the comments for review because I still have some terrible things being said to me to me that are not true and I'm not going to give a stage for that okay um in closing if anybody out there says that they're doing trades that are live and they making $220,000 a day or whatever and they're not doing it in a simulator let them Show You by logging into a live account and doing it like this I'd be interested to see that also until next time be safe

all right folks welcome back this is episode number eight applying institutional order flow to forex markets all right folks welcome back taking a look at trading view and i promise this is going to be a really short one tonight um let's go to euro and whenever i'm looking at data from trading view this is the data feed i use for forex pairs only forex.com i don't want definitely not them all right so we have the daily chart up for euro yen just so you know i hate the end pairs i can't stand them but but for the sake of completeness this is how you would look for these types of patterns in forex now i have lots of feedback in the comments section that you don't get to see but it's really just for me i get a lot of requests whether or not this is appropriate to be using for higher time frame charts and i think daily charts are what everyone classifies a higher higher time frame chart so i want you to take a look at shark fry do any mock up on it pause the video if you're not ready still don't pause it to you all right take a look at the relative equal lows over you see that it's gonna go quick and dirty tonight right and dirty all right so we have relative equal lows marked out over here the market has traded down through and created a run higher now here is why i do not like the end pairs okay i get questions all the time why don't you like again pairs icd they move around nice they do this they do that they tend to have like a double return to a specific level i like to see and you're going to see it right here okay swing high the market rallies through that there's no fair value out there it drops back down in then it runs again taking out this swing high so we have two points of market structure that have moved to the upside in order its price is traded above it now this leg here you want to go back through that and see is there a fair value gap well we have one and two market trades down into it here sends it higher what's above here buy side liquidity this old high back here could be a draw on liquidity as well so there's gonna be buy stops whether it trades there or not it's irrelevant okay it's likely to draw to it just like you know playing horseshoes you play the game horseshoes not every single time you throw a horseshoe is it going to go on that post but it's still fun to play right so you're aiming at that post whether you hit that post or not and this would be like the post in the game playing horseshoes you're just aiming for it now obviously we started trading a new day here but this candle which was the 10th of february 2022 this daily candle we could trust that this was likely to go higher because we went up we've consolidated and then start another run into this high here again whether it trades through it or not it's irrelevant okay because even a failure swing to get above old highs if there's enough range from being right here at the open to reaching up to here that's enough to take a stab at it and see if you're going to get any kind of yield so that's an example of it occurring on a daily chart but i want to go into this very day right there okay the 10th so we're going to drop down into a 15 minute time frame all right here's a 15 minute time frame and we're going to mark up our chart midnight new york time rocket rallies in here yeah and then we go into the new york session right here so we're going to go into this price structure and fair it out the run that occurred in here so i'm going to put a rectangle in this area so that way we know what we're looking at relative to this 15 minute time frame you guys ask why i do powerpoint slides this is the reason why it makes it a lot easier to go right to what i'm looking for all right we're gonna drop down to a five minute chart okay and if you take a look at seven o'clock in the morning 10 o'clock in the morning that's your new york ict killzone okay that's the time of day that new york session trades form i have more information in that regard for time of day for forex in this channel i said lots of videos lots of topics and things you can explore i don't want to beat it to death because i've already done in other places but just know that seven o'clock in the morning 10 o'clock in the morning new york time again on trading view you need to have it toggled to that everything else it'll be wrong all right so here is the time of day at the forming of a new york setup forms all right so we have the market trading down takes out a swing low trades down below that and then punches higher right above this swing high inside this price like right here is there a fair value gap we're going to start breaking it down top down from five minute top down we're gonna break it down from the five minute down to the one minute chart so from this low up to this high right in there that's we're gonna study on each new time frame so i'll go down to three minutes okay so in this price leg here do we take out a swing low yes we trade down below swing low does it take out a swing high here yes it does so now we have a valid condition to see if there's a trade go back through this price leg is there a fair value got right in here and this one here so remember i was teaching you it could stab down there just be mindful of that but try to get your entry in on that one there and that's what we have here trace that to it there now the question is going to be is how far will it trade to because we're not looking at anything over here because a middle of the range type idea so for expansion type moves practical lesson tonight where if we don't have a range to trade inside of how do we anticipate how far can trade up or trade down in this case we're looking for a long where would our targets be because the old high is over here now i'm sure if we went to a hard time frame keep looking to the left we'll find something but a real easy way is to take your price leg over here see this swing low break prior to this run up then we consolidated drop down create a discount and then create our retracement rally and start to run up into these highs how can we know well i like to take a fib anchor it let go of my and anchor it to a previous swing okay so from this low that is high after we leave this consolidation it starts to trade higher um standard deviation negative one and i got a lot of questions you know what's my setup for my fib i actually show that on the ote primer video so you're welcome to take a look at that on the youtube channel as well 133.153 and that's not that let's see hi is 133 15 and three so right to the right to the point that you'd be looking for and then we've seen it received from that okay so obviously when i show example like this makes me want to trade me in but i hate this pair i can't stand there's other markets that can scratch my itch for 4x but this one is not one i like to trade but i wanted to come out tonight and kind of give you a quick view of what you could do with these markets using the model okay there is a approach that you can use with the london session okay and london would be marking up your vertical lines relative to new york local time two o'clock in the morning to five a.m so you'd have your your bracket so your operating hours would be hunting the setup for new york between seven o'clock in the morning and ten o'clock local new york time for london session trades you would look for setups that would provide you a way to trade a fair value gap between two o'clock in the morning and five o'clock in the morning okay and that's as easy as i can make it for you it's simple and any additional information you would want to have i have absolutely covered it in other videos in this youtube channel okay so it's predominantly a forex channel and it's only been recently with the 2022 mentorship i'm talking and teaching about the stock indices so i got a lot of requests for 4x so here you go it's simply applying what you've been trained with the futures indices but just applying it to the forex market but applying it to the time of day relative to new york or london and yes you can take trades in asia yes you can take trades in london close but i'd prefer to have you just trade on these two time frames here or time of day rather being new york open which is what's being shown here seven o'clock tomorrow ten o'clock in the morning new york local time again always i can't say it enough because if you don't do this and you just have it set to your local time it won't work but it's new york local time on trading view seven o'clock to ten o'clock this is the time when you're hunting the setup okay so in summary we can anticipate this market going higher why because the euro dollar is going higher you can also check it by going to let's go to daily chart first and you can go to 6e which is euro futures and let us use the front month continuous okay you can see how euro where has it been going so has it been going lower or higher clearly going higher what has the yen been doing so when you look at forex pairs you want to look for that relationship between the instruments that make up your pair so euro yen euro is strong yen is weak so what would that mean for euro yen it would mean that if your bias is bullish and you have this underpinning between euro and yen it's going to make this pair go higher it's a real simple way of looking at how to determine these exotic crosses okay and how to frame the logic behind whether it should go higher or lower and then apply time today wait for the pattern i'm teaching you and you won't need to do anything else you don't need to buy a subscription to anybody's services you don't need to learn anything else you don't have to buy any courses it's all right here for free and it works until i talk to you next week enjoy weekend and be safe

all right folks welcome back this is episode nine for the 2022 ICT mentorship on YouTube this lecture is going to be on Power Three which is accumulation manipulation and distribution and New York PM session opportunities all right so we're looking at the NASDAQ e- mini Futures this is The Continuous chart on trading view so if you look at the daily range where we've been we're inside this range here okay so we have this swing high and this swing low now why am I picking these two reference points well namely this is the low most recently after taking out this short-term low so we've dug into all the sell side liquidity resting below that low we retraced back up inside of this High to that low so we went back up into a premium the range high to low running a fib just to get the 50% level that gives us equilibrium anything below that is a discount notice how the market traded down on Monday into a deep discount but did not take out these lows over here but look how we closed on Monday we had an indecisive candle the body was basically absent the open and close was essentially you the same thing if we have that and the Market's trading down into a discount even though we might have a load down here that we're targeting this may require a retracement now notice at the close of Monday's trading we had an imbalance from this low and this high on Tuesday's trading overnight the equities markets had a run up into this imbalance here so this fair value Gap was ret traded to in here this low and this High we'll look at that in reference to the lower time frame this lower level is the low end of the fair value gap on the daily chart and this level up here is the upper end of the fair value Gap I'm taking your attention to Monday's trading and I want to talk a little bit about power three which is accumulation distribution and manipulation okay so generally my teachings are like this if I'm bullish I'm expecting the opening price to be near the low of the day or the session then it trades lower making some important low and then rallies creates a high and then closes near the high of the day now it's not important for you to try to predict the closing price what I'm trying to train you to anticipate is the likelihood of the market making some kind kind of a fake move like a Judas swing okay Judas swing is the false move typically in London and in New York session there are fake runs that start off a move and I walked you through it last week on my community tab where I outlined the actual Judas swing for that particular day using the fair value Gap outlin the the low I was only off by cor of a point for the low in that range and that created the low today the idea is what I'm going to show you here as well on Monday we had price Dro down overnight Consolidated and then we have a little bit of a rally ahead of the equities open okay so in here we have 8:30 in the morning if you look at 8:30 what do we have we have the highs over here they're suspect because they're relative equal highs there but look what we left here ahead of 8:30 we had this huge imbalance so if we run these highs out after the open at 9:30 it's likely to trade down into that and rebounds but watch what it does it and we trade up into that level here which creates the fair value gaps low-end parameter remember this is Monday's trading it sells off so this line isn't here on Monday that's not what we're looking at we're looking at the likelihood of coming back down into this area here after taking these highs out if it does so if it trades back into this imbalance that's a good candidate to go long now the imbalance in here if you go to the left of it you can see the down close candles that's your bullish order block the market trades down hits the order block and it's an afternoon trade so it starts to rally and then consolidates since to close overnight we create a wicked run last night this was an it ran last night and most of all the move for today was done before we even got to the opening of the morning had a little bit of a retracement after 8:30 and at 9:30 we Consolidated I'll talk a little bit about that as a market profile in a moment but then we drop down create an important low of the day and then we rally it got real close to the fair value gaps high-end parameter but didn't get to it we don't need it's just like I was mentioning here you don't need to try to predict the closing price with power three which is accumulation manipulation so in other words if you're bullish it opens where you think it's going to trade higher it's going to be most likely a small little move lower that's the move you want to try to go in and Hunt along if you miss it you want to try to get long real close to where the opening price is now the question is going to be is where is the opening price well I like 830 okay you use the opening price here at 830 draw that out in time did we go below it yes did we go inside the imbalance yes did we take out a short-term low yes did we hit an order block yes was it an optimal trade entry yes lots of factors there over here same thing opening price here did we trade lower than that yes did it go even lower than that later on in the afternoon yes then it rallied taking out the relative equal highs here and again gravitating towards that upper end of that fair value gap on the daily chart now I'm in a 5 minute chart on that same February 14th and I want to take you closer to what price is done in here that imbalance the lowest portion of it here with all the down closed candles here now this is anchored to the Daily bullish order block but you can see how we traded into it here with one two three four down closed candles that is a complete order block on this time frame so consecutive down closed candles right before a price surge that has an imbalance that's how you find your order blocks okay so a high probability order block would be your narrative or your bias is bullish you're looking for displacement that's this right here where the market runs real quick higher and the down close candles you want to mark that out and anticipate a return back in to that now again this level is not there yet we don't know this level until Monday's close so don't be tricked thinking that I have this level here and I knew it was going to go right to that level in term I'm not suggesting that at all what I'm suggesting is is watch what happens when it creates that high it breaks down all this price action here gets overran into a retracement back down into this imbalance here the low of this candle and the high of this candle that right there that's your fair value got with an order block and optimal trade entry rallies even though it's sloppy it's still continuously driving higher this high at the close on this day here at say 4:30 okay 4:30 in afternoon to me that's like the close for me no it trades a little bit later than that and then closes for a little while and it also technically closes when the bell rings at 4:00 p.m. you local time in New York because there's a little bit of trading past that I like to just look at 430 and just consider that where we are in terms of what we've done for the full range and then determine what I have left for maybe inbalance or liquidity pools here is that drop down here on a one minute chart it's digging into that order block right here if you look real close let me go back up one slide I want you to see what I'm showing you here right here this price action see 14140 14120 this little area right here I'm looking at on a one minute chart 14140 14120 that in that vicinity see that small little Gap right there see that see the swing High we trade above it create a fair value Gap there trade down into it this is an afternoon trade this is 2:00 in the afternoon local time in New York inside the order block inside the fair value Gap inside a retracement of the fair value Gap that sets the stage of a market run up into a higher retracement now we don't know if this is going to be the closing parameter for a daily fair value Gap we don't need to know that yet but this is a likely scenario to go long and we can look for a run back up into this range here or run the buy stops above here or maybe inside here sloppy run but nonetheless it's still pressing higher now here's today on the 15th of February 2022 notice what we had with had this enormous price run overnight in technically the London session now a lot of you going to ask would I have caught this no no I wouldn't have caught it I would have missed it and I would if I was awake I wouldn't have seen it coming let's just put it that way so this right here was a complete surprise to me when I woke up saw it but I want you to think about when you have these overnight runs that were basically these big moves overnight before the session begins in New York when you're trading equities this also works with Forex too so it's important try not to chase price this is what I mean by don't chase it don't chase it last week when I was commenting and outlining the NASDAQ and giving you a fair value Gap real time explaining to where I thought it was going to draw down to and it created the New York session low of the day okay that's what I was outlining just take a look at go back and look at you'll see it's it's pretty obvious the same logic I'm amplifying that here okay overnight what was the market doing it was rallying so when we open up at 8:30 do we go in here and start buying it just because it's gone up overnight no we don't chase it you have to wait no we don't chase it we have to wait for more information what information are we waiting for well typically whenever you see a big run up or a big run down there's a consolidation that takes place shortly after now not always it just keeps on ripping higher or lower and you'll either miss a move or if you get lucky maybe you can participate in it but this is what I typically look for so if there's a lot of range movement overnight which overnight um 2 o'cl in the morning to 5 o' in the morning okay if we get a big run like that which is what we're seeing here right away in my mind I'm thinking don't trade a lot don't expect a lot of in and out in and out perect you know perfect Precision wait for a real significant price move otherwise you're going to get chopped up now what does that mean well when we have it opening here at 830 look to the left what do we have we have this High here and we have the low over here we can use this one because they're relative equal but I like this one why why do I like this one what's below it fair value got see that so it's likely a trade down after it creates this sloppy opening look at all this movement in here now as a personal study there's two or three YouTubers that I watch that trade the equities market indices and I'm not trying to say anything bad about them I just like to listen to what they're thinking because they don't look at the market like I do I'm not suggesting that they're not profitable because they show live trades they get into trades they take them and sometimes they win and sometimes they don't but I'd like to read kind of like a a Squawk Box what their interpretation of price is and they're looking at this area in here and it's back and forth they think if it go if it goes here it's going to go there if it goes here if it's going to go there it's all these scenarios are going through you know randomly in their live streams so when I'm watching price I'm listening for them to want to be a buyer so when they're trying to be a buyer that means they're they're already hunting a continuation of this move here I want to see a low form now this is what we have for the today we we start going lower first so that's good we create a pseudo Judas swing but did it create a nice low and turn away from itm look at all this back and forth and it created these suspect lows in here relative equal lows there's going to be sell side building up below that sell stops okay when it starts to go higher anyone that was long overnight they're going to jam their stop loss right underneath that okay when this occurs that's the very scenario I'm looking for now right away in my mind here's what I want you to understand if there's a big move overnight for equities this is not Forex okay this part is not Forex it's just for trading like NASDAQ Dow and e- mini S&P if there a big run overnight avoid the New York session don't even mess with the New York session wait until the other side of lunch at 1:00 in the afternoon New York time and then anticipate the New York lunch lows taken out or the New York morning session lows which is what we have here notice how we rallied up we didn't take out the relative equal highs here that was formed ahead of 7 o'clock in the morning notice that now this over here we know this range up here is the high end of that fair value Gap why do we know that because the 14th stopped trading and it had the indecisive candle in the daily chart so it's likely that we might trade up into this Range High and this is that range low so if we can draw down below that low it was formed initially in New York session we have a fair value Gap over here with sell side while we have yet to take out the buy side theity here at around I don't know 14575 and then get up to that fair value Gap high or the the boundary of it okay kind of like the resistance level of it so this is the draw in liquidity and we have a minor draw in liquidity here with Bice liquidity look what we have in terms of price action the NASDAQ drops down taking out the cell side digging into that fair value Gap see that look at the bodies of the candles isn't that neat how just respects that level back here now that's not random okay these are algorithmic principles that are in play and these markets are unbelievably precise when they are in better conditions right now if you've been trading with live funds or if you've been trying to follow price action there's been a lot of it makes a run then it goes into this choppy sideways and it's very frustrating if you're trying to get like sustained price moves or if you don't know how to operate in these like these sloppy little ranges like this I personally don't think that this is high probability trading you can get chopped up you can get losing trades you can draw your account down if you don't control yourself you can blow your account in these types of conditions how do you avoid that how do you avoid running out your account and then scaling back if you're a high frequency type of a Trader how do you draw back on the frequency and look for the better setups what I'm showing you here you wait you don't chase the overnight run and you wait for them to give you a low that everybody overnight will want to put their stop loss right beneath that after it starts a rally above it it's even better when you don't have this High taken out yet see how I took it up here and it just went right down for him that's engineering liquidity it runs up consolidates creates a low starts to rally and everybody's thinking I don't want to lose my profits I don't want to lose out on making more money but I had to put a stop loss right here because the books tell me I had to do that so I did the same kind of stuff folks I'm not trying to talk down anybody but I'm just repeating what a retail Trader's mindset would be and the logic behind this okay so the narrative with this day was the stocks were trailed below these lows the afternoon session again creates the low of the day takes the sell side liquidity out into a fair value Gap and then rallies now in here I'm going to teach you a little bit more about that watch notice we don't really have a fair value gap down here but it gives us the basis for expecting the price to start to Rally into the afternoon now at 2:00 in the afternoon 1,400 on this trading view chart that starts 2 o'clock in the afternoon New York local time we have the market trading down into an imbalance over here liquidity resting below these relative equal lows is taken out so what are we looking at we've seen a price run that we don't think needs to come back down here because the logic is the overnight stops have been ran out down here there's no reason for the market to want to come back down there but we have this low and these relative equal lows here Post New York lunch New York lunch is noon to 1:00 in the afternoon New York local time so the imbalance we trade down into that what's the likelihood of it coming all the way through the imbalance and then going after that low not likely not likely not after seeing this run here they don't want to give these Traders another chance to get back in they got stopped out so it's going to be a little bit more sneakier when they make these new setups that continue into a higher run so they take out the sell side below these relative equal lows take those stops out and then it rallies and then drops back down now here watch we have a swing high right here it breaks it does it trade above that yes was it energetic yes does it have a fair value Gap yes so now the market trades down into it here creates a short-term low you could be a buyer there there's nothing wrong with that but say you missed it say you just I mean this is a one minute chart say you missed it and the market starts to run off like this but then it gives you another opportunity I've had many times trades formed just like this where I was looking for something I was waiting for a setup to happen either my cell phone's buzzing or I grab a drink is just outside of reach I got to go walk over to the other end of the desk and grab it and then all of a sudden here you go I miss it takes off the fair value Gap is even better when you have the sell side liquidity resting below short-term low and the drop down into it here you can use that low as your entry or minus one tick okay this short-term low forms at 2:34 p.m. now if you look at the low figure up here that value represents that candle right there so that's why you see it highlighter here when I took a screenshot I'm holding underneath this candle so that way the reference points up here are directly related to this candle so you can see the low is 14528 and a half so you could be a buyer on a limit at 14,520 and a quarter or maybe if you want to try to reach for the you the 28 even number either way that's a nice place to put a limit order in the short-term low down here after the fair value Gap forms that's where your stop loss is that's the rules so you have an entry point your stop and between the two of them it works out to be okay let's say you have 14 14 and a quarter in terms of risk okay so 14 and a quarter points or handles of total risk and let's assume that you were trading I don't know six contracts on the micro you're essentially looking at buying and risking $85 to make about $300 so it's about 3.5 to one reward the risk thereabouts I'm roughing I don't have calculator in front of me folks just you do the math now here this value is important because I want you to see in these conditions you can't expect it to be perfect you can't be you know expecting to be in there at the lowest point no draw down no heat on the position and then it just goes in your favor don't think like that you can see on this candle if you would have bought here you would have had nine points of heat okay or basically $54 if you were trading six micros now obviously it goes up more than that if you're trading One Mini because it's $20 per handle but overall this is a nice little setup with the afternoon using the logic over here even though it doesn't give us a fair value Gap the you know the setups that I'm teaching you to use using the fair value Gap afternoon taking the stops it provides the Baseline for bias for the afternoon now what did I teach you here I taught you that you can use these reference points with the underlying sentiment that's already in motion if you didn't trade overnight and take that big run I didn't get any of that run I didn't do anything with that if you miss that it doesn't matter because that is something that's going to give you more insight and it tells you when to avoid the morning session don't trade it everybody's going to be doing what think about it everybody woke up and saw these markets and they all wanted to do what they wanted to buy it because it's going up a lot and they want to chase it that idea leads many times to losing trades and then it's starts this cycle where you go into this chasing chasing chasing and then when the market does these sideways consolidations and sloppy choppy market conditions it it's literally like a blowtorch on your account if you don't know how to stop or if you don't know what you're doing you can literally talk yourself into millions of Trades and then draw your countdown last slide and just to hammer this down this is zoomed in on a one minute chart swing High broken fair value G right there and we have that shortterm low here I'm noted in here so that's where you would be basically entering one with that idea trading below that is where the sell stops are trading below that now it goes below that now some of you have mentioned in the comment section does this invalidate the fair value Gap no it does not the idea is the fair value gaps we look at the look at the body of this candle here isn't that respecting that yes so in my mind I'm thinking well I know prices sometimes especially the way it is right now it's very volatile so I'm permitting a greater level of imperfection in price delivery and then using the logic of the fair value Gap as the basis for my entry idea and then using the stop premise which it didn't get it didn't get here it didn't stop you out you had basically what five what was that five or so uh more handles before you would have been stopped now watching it live might make you look little nervous but at some point folks you're going to have to get used to if you're going to trade like this in these really little time frames and you're trying to be very Nimble you're going to have to learn to trust the setups and let the stops do their jobs and if it if it gets stopped out that's just one trade you got wrong it's not your career look for the next one now I'm going to throw this in here as a bonus but you know take it for what it is it r is here takes off and does not take out that the buy side liquidity resting above here did not get taken here yet and then we had this imbalance and it trades down into it and then hits what the order block that's a buy and you can if you miss this one you can pick up this one based on the logic I teach on the YouTube channel so this is actually something that's taught in the YouTube channel okay uh this whole pattern here is exactly right out of my high probability short-term trading or scalping series I can't remember exactly what the title was but uh this pattern has right in that and then it runs for that liquidity there so there's two setups there so I've took something from the free lessons that's already on the YouTube channel and also amplifying something I've been teaching in this mentorship series hopefully you found this one insightful and until talk to you next time be safe

all right folks welcome back this is episode number 10 of the 2022 ICT mentorship for the YouTube channel this lecture is going to be teaching implementing economic calendar events with the open all right so the economic calendar many of you probably don't even consider looking at this but it's important if you're going to be learning how to speculate study these markets certainly if you're ever going to consider putting live funds in you really want to know what this calendar says for the day you're going to be trading otherwise you could be surprised unfortunately adversely with a sudden Rush of volatility that you wouldn't otherwise expect this is Thursday's economic calendar for Thursday February 17th and not all of these things are going to be Heavy Hitters for stock indices but most of them are and what I'm showing here is what I teach all my students I go to forexfactory.com I use their economic calendar it's not the only one you can use it's whatever you like I like the color scheme they use it's just a personal preference you can pick any economic calendar they're all going to pretty much say the same thing here the medium impact events are like orange low impact are yellow and anything that's red which is not being shown here here would be like a high impact news driver so when we look at these stock indices the reason why I teach you 8:30 in the morning like that's your beginning time to start looking at or crosshairs time the news embargo lifts at this time at 8:30 typically there's a bunch of news events that are being ushered into the marketplace at that time now some of these reports or speeches or data points they may may be used as a smokees screen they may be used as a catalyst to have price go up or down at the time of their release other instances like I'm going to teach tonight usually there's going to be a buildup or a dropping down in price right before the report comes out and then the real move starts to ensue okay so it'll make more sense as I get into the actual teachings okay so we're looking at the NASDAQ daily chart this is the trading view continuous charts that way you'll know what I'm looking at here it's the one we've been working with in this mentorship so the daily chart when I'm talking about power three a lot of comments came in the previous video mentioning how it was confusing to them because obviously they're they're new they just found me they don't know what I'm talking about when I say power three I actually have a teaching in the YouTube channel so you can look it up and study it but I'll give you a little bit more amplification here also kind of like help bridge the gaps in your understanding about daily bias because if I could tell you what was the most requested question over the years since I've been mentoring people without a doubt absolutely without a doubt the number one question I get is ICT can you please teach me the daily bias can you tell me if it's going to be an up day or a down day and I'm going to teach you here and this is my honest to God's truth okay I'm never going to be able to do it any easier than this okay you just have to study price action and you'll see it for yourself after a while but this is really all I teach my students and it is nothing more secret to it it's this is it okay it's just the brass tax of looking at what the daily range is likely to form so right away we're at the daily chart and as I mentioned in the previous episode I outlined this High here and this low and that was the range we were within and the 50 level was equilibrium so again above equilibrium is what the premium market and Below 50% is a discount market so we traded back up into the top end of the range between this low and this high and between these two levels here remember I gave you this low and this High that's that's a imbalance okay it's a fair value Gap this Market was down in a discount initially after we had the indecisive candle go back and watch the ninth episode you haven't watched that one yet and you're watching this one it's going to feel like even more confusion but we had an indecisive candle here and we were in a discount even though I believe and I've been telling my own students that I believe we're going to clean out these lows down here we went to a discount relative to the dealing range between this high and that low so below it we're at discount and we have an imbalance so it's likely to do what go back up and rebalance this before going back down listen to what I said in the episode number nine I said even if we trade back up into this range there's trades you can take even if we believe that it's going to go below those lows that's me tipping my hand to you I'm not trying to provide you signals I'm not going to tell you Buy Here Sell Here put your stop here take your I'm not I'm not doing that in the community tab on my YouTube channel probably once a week I'm going to point out something in the chart right before it happens and I want you to try to study it you may not be able to see it real time you may miss it come to the YouTube channel after work or whatever maybe you're sleeping and you couldn't see it at the time but still go through your charts using the information I'm providing you I get asked all the time can you please put a date and time reference in the post I forget I I try to remember doing it when I wake up if I'm going to post anything but something happens and I see in the chart and I Hur most I want to put everything in the post and I I forgot it so I apologize for that it's a work in progress folks so if we look at the reference points of it being in a premium Market or a discount Market but then we have this imbalance and we have a bias that and it's likely to go down and take out these lows so what have we said here in short the Market's been going lower yes we took out some sell stops below this low with the sell side liquidity being taken out here then a natural retracement which is reasonable then we start the decline then we come back up one more time failure swing doesn't go above that high and then it breaks down and it creates an imbalance when it takes out this shortterm low wow that's kind of like the model I'm teaching you yes now what's the framework here we rallied broke below a short-term low with the model suggesting that these lows may be taken out so any Rally or up Clos candle or candles should be viewed as a potential shorting candidate now ring in the imbalance we traded up into the imbalance one more day we swept above it not by much then the next day we open we rall just a little bit and then plunge we took out the previous day low and the day before it's low so both of these daily lows have been cleaned out now this one is the next one then down here so when I talk about power three I'm specifically dealing with this time frame the daily chart if you consider where the Market opens say this is the opening price in the daily range if you're expecting it to go down or maybe you weren't expecting it to go down you just looking at the price in your chart and you see that the open was here it rallied a little bit then it went down and then closed near the low now that's a rather simplistic overview just making it very plain nothing terribly exciting about that but when you really start to consider it it is really exciting because this is the market right here if you understand this and you can study a daily chart daily bias will become easier for you if you start implementing it with this mindset so if we're bearish okay if we're bearish on a market we're going to anticipate the daily ranges or each one of these candles doing this very thing here open a rally not much of a rally but it can make a large Wick it doesn't make a difference but the general premise is it goes up just to go down and it closes down near its low when it's bearish obviously this would be reversed where the open would be down here near the low and the close would be near the high of the daily candle if it's bullish but not every single candle in a series of the entire price swing is going to be all up closed candles when you're bullish conversely not every candle is going to be a down closed candle when you're bearish but I've already taught you when you have these sustained price swings on the higher time frame you're not seeing a lot of up closed candles when it's bearish and you're not seeing a lot of down Clos candles when it's bullish but contrast that with what you may be feeling when you're looking at price you'll make a big deal out of one down day when you've been bullish and it completely takes you out of your game oh I can't determine bias I don't know what's going on this is always tricking me I felt that too in the 90s I know what it feels like but let's take a closer look at this this is the chart that I used to trade back in 1992 the classic open high low and close bar which is what I'm showing you here now with this chart it made perfect sense to me and if my eyes were not as poor Poe as they are now because I'm I'm aging and I've been looking at computer screens for 30 plus years now it's warm them down so obviously candlesticks are a much more preferred way of looking at it because it's thicker you can see the the open and close relationship as I'm teaching you here a lot easier versus this you have to strain to see where the open is on this candle is to the left of the cand or not it's not even a candle it's a bar so to the left of the bar is the open it trades down creates the low rallies up and closes near the high see that same thing here it opens trades down goes up and closes above the opening but in the upper portion of the daily range then we have a high where it doesn't really matter where it closes then it's likely to do what come back and rebalance this it'll make sense in a moment it opens here small little rally up creates this very thing here on this day it opens small little rally up and then down overlapping this daily bar if we look at this relationship over here we have this one single pass with that bar range between this candle's low and this candle's High that's our fair value Gap the market can trade back up into it and look where it closes right on the highs in the next candle it's back and forth works both sides of the range but what is our bias what did I hint at the bias is bearish we're looking for these lows to be taken out so the only thing we were doing was coming back up to rebalance this then go lower so once we went back to the top of the range did this candle or bar touch this candle or bars low no just fell short of it this wiped back and forth so now this range here is completely balanced so there's no reason for this price to hang around now it could have went a little bit higher today and I was waiting for that to potentially happen but I've not abandoned my bearishness for price to go down here all my students know that this movement here we have the open the rally up fade it comes back down and closes on the low that's this pattern right here power three is accumulation manipulation distribution okay that's the three components the power asset ECT is if you understand those relationships on what the daily range is doing the open on a day that's bearish okay the open and anything above it that is accumulation of shorts now it's not limited to just open and above that's the that's where smart money and people like myself and my students that's where we're aiming to enter good and short it can be whatever the range is this is important because my students are actually going to smile when they get this is too the open to the high whatever that range is you take that range and you subtract it from the opening price that is your opening range that's where your fair value gaps that's where your stop raids are going to happen that's where optimal trade entry is going to happen every potential shorting candidate whatever system approach that I teach even in my paid mentorship every premium array okay okay that's what I teach it as every single one of them will reside and form in the range between the open and its high in other words if you're watching price and you're bearish the day opens up and then it rallies up that's a Judah swing the range from the opening price up to that high that range is what you project below the opening price that is your opening range when I say opening range that's opening range so what that does is gives me a an area at which to bracket out how much leeway I can give the market when it starts to go below the opening price and still take a favorable entry because power three is I'm bearish I'm expecting the market to open and rally above if I can get something on short there that's the ideal scenario but I may not be able to do it or I may take a trade early or just take a trade and I get stopped out it's going to happen but then it breaks down below the opening price does that completely ruin the day for me sometimes it it'll just tear off and I can't catch it doesn't give me a setup and I just miss it and you can't chase it and don't worry about it but don't be upset go back in your back testing and you'll see that there's lots of opportunities coming in just below the opening price this is called close proximity entries this is what I promised in this mentorship on YouTube teaching you in the mentorship community I already know most of you that have recently found me and there's been a lot of you that just came on I appreciate all of you joining me but you don't know all the things that I've been teaching on this YouTube channel so you feel like you're drinking from a fire hose right now and it can feel like it's tearing your face off because it's so much information all at one time and leaves your head spinning like this guy keeps talking I don't understand get to the point the point is you need to have layered understanding and if you're not going to be patient and go through the content properly I'm not going to help you I'm going to frustrate you and you'll probably come back to me later on and then learn properly and wish you would have stayed in did it the right way the first time but that's for you to determine on your own having the opening range when you're bearish whatever the high is from the opening project that down your cell setups are going to form in that that is accumulation of shorts the manipulation is the initial rally up that's the sucker play that's typically the breakout artist thinking oh it's going to go higher no it only goes up just to go down that that's a fake run then it goes lower creates the low of the day and then closes near the low of the day so between where the low of the day is and where it closes that's distribution what's being distributed smart monies short positions so they're selling at the open and above or just below it riding out the daily range when it creates the low of the day how do you know when the low of the day is formed well I've taught you time references so if price has been really taking a a beating going lower and you're getting towards the end of the day like 330 you know 345 something like that it's probably really close to the low not all the time sometimes it creates a real fast sudden continuation and if you're not expecting it or if you're offside it can be bad but if it's on side it's really fun to be a part of that but generally it's the last portion of the trading day and it'll create some kind of a low and then wherever it closes between that low and where it closes that's where the distribution cycle is occurring that part is not that important the main thing is understanding what does this candle have the highest probability in terms of forming an open rally sell off and close down on its low or is it likely to create an opening trade lower first then rally and close near the highs take the let's take the close out okay I don't want you thinking you have to know or be able to predict the closing price that's more advanced you don't even need that to be profitable you just need to know is this daily range more likely to expand higher or lower than the opening price that's it that's all you have to do that's the key to bias now how do you know what the bias is going to be most likely not everyday bias most likely what's the bias going to be well let's go back to this low over here it creates a swing low that means a low with a higher low to the right of it and a higher low to the left of it so it's three candles that make up a swing low you do not need a Williams fractal that's way too many candles and you've missed the move okay you don't need that no disrespect for the gentleman but that's nonsense you don't need that okay you only need three candles once you get a swing low or swing high and you have the proper context and you know what you're looking for that's it you go in there you start hunting it now watch what happens we have a swing low form the very next candle we have an opening it trades way down and then comes back up and closes right near the highs is that the opposite of this candle yeah but it's got a whole lot of movement below the opening price so something just took place down here after this swing low was formed did this candle or bar go lower than that one no I promise I'm going to switch the candles but I just want to show you from this perspective because this is what we were forced to learn on back in the old days okay back in the dinosaur time so the rallying up on this candle here and closing on the high that supports this as a swing low because it didn't take out the lower low right here in the middle between this low and this low this is the lowest low of the three candles or Price bars the next day we have a big wash out from the open trading down and then it closed on the high so the next day we're likely to go what into this area here isn't that a fair value Gap sure sure it is what's the daily bias likely to be bullish so that means it's going to do the opposite of this it's going to open near the low and then rally and expand higher will it close on the high I don't know it could but I don't need it to I only need it to open and start to rally and get up in this area here that's an opportunity that's a trade does it do it yes but now when we trade it up into this area look what happens next day you might be expecting an open rally close High it doesn't give you that so that could be a day where you missed an opportunity or you took a a loss no problem next trading day here what are we seeing we're seeing the market retrace back down into this run how far can it go down well look at your high down to your low equilibrium it's probably going to go below equilibrium to do what to offer the market a discount the market does what it goes down below it provides a discount once it gets there our mind we're thinking it's going to be the opposite of this it's going to be to open near the low and expand higher that's power three it's going to be accumulation of Longs at the low and then rally higher we have it right there it opens near the low rally and closes on the high the next day same thing opens on the low rallies and closes on the high now we've gone deeper into this area here and in a small little range but it's still the same function of power three accumulation which is open near the low trade down and then close high on the daily range next candle same thing it opens trades down accumulates Longs trades higher same thing here what's this it opens trades down trades higher until we do what we take out this short-term High see that then we can get a retracement lower or consolidation we get both small little retracement and consolidation next candle power three delivering for accumulation of Longs next candle consolidation might be a day you took a loss let's be real next candle what's the bias what are these over here they're relative equal highs there's stops resting above that that's buy side liquidity what's it drawing up to we've already taken out this High what's going to go up to here likely right because we've already taken out sell stops below here with this drop and we keep proving it's going higher so where's it likely to go above here so until we get to that point we keep thinking the opposite of what we're showing here an open near the low and close on the high power three accumulation of Longs distribution of Longs at the close the next day indecisive candle okay no big deal next candle we open trade down same thing we're looking for buys the whole time we're looking for Buys in here you might get stopped out you might have a losing trade but you're not abandoning the bullish bias until we get above these highs then we have to study it does it want to run higher once it clears these highs does it keep showing and want to go higher well we had a nice run here here the next candle here nice run here small little IND decisive candle there but then we go back in the same cycle again it's expanding and it's accelerating higher each day we're looking for Longs opening near the low trades below the opening a little bit then rallies and closes near the high that's bias that's sticking to your bias and the same thing is done over here on opposite we have imbalance here and I promise after this I'll change it to candlesticks your eyes are probably going nuts right now fair value Gap we trade up into it so once we trade into it what are we expecting the market to do what trade back lower so if we're trading back lower we're going to be looking for this pattern open rally accumulation of shorts distribution at the lows what are you Distributing the short positions they've accumulated above or at the opening price so in this candle what do we have we have the open it rallies up to go short and then trades down closes on the low just like this this here see that the next candle You're Expecting the same thing does it deliver that no you might take a loss that day too okay no big deal it's likely to go where here's where the sell side is now each candle open rally close down on low open rally close down on the low open way back into this one and then still closes lower than the open but still nice range down same thing here opens rallies sells off next candle opens sells off then comes back and overlaps it and now we have a potential key reversal then we have back and forth price action where you can probably get beat up inbalance it trades up into that and then we go into that area where we're at now so let's go to a Candlestick and it's a lot easier to see it this way but this function of Power Three is how I teach the bias and I also teach how to submit to the Daily range you have to learn how to hold to the close if you're going to just trade and you're not really participating in uh the sustained moves that's made available in these daily ranges like today I mean look at this move here that's nice many of you probably took shorts maybe maybe some of you took Longs I got some people putting comments in the previous video saying you know I saw a pair value up at this price at this time for a bullish it's not bullish we're not bu we're our bias is not bullish it's bearish it's already traded to the top end of that fair value got and it's likely to go lower now taking out this cell side and attacking the cell side over here okay all right let's drop down to an hourly chart and that fair value Gap the high and the low levels that's what's being shown here right there and these annotations are obviously from what you saw on the episode 9 so Watch What Happens the market trades down find some support at the low end of the fair value Gap then rallies back up to the high end of the fair value Gap and then breaks right before midnight on the 17th and then we consolidate trade back up into what what is this what's this right here it's a fair value G price goes up rebalances that there and it's doing it what time a day not New York it's overnight European London session that's is how you can use that model the same model you can use it in Asian session you ain't going to get a lot of movement CU it's typically not a lot of movement in that time of day but you can trade it in London clothes you can trade it in obviously the New York open like I'm teaching you and London open London open if you know what you're doing with a daily bias you can catch enormous moves enormous moves but sometimes you're going to have to weigh out a lot of give and take back and forth kind of like today where the market rebalanced here and then consolidated waited for a little bit of a push higher then the news came out okay so I'm kind of hopefully clear that up for you now all right 15minute time frame I'm take a look at this imbalance here we rode up into that rebalancing all this movement down remember that paint roller analogy I gave you the paint was applied to the wall going down but if all this movement was given to that one single candle there's going to be little porous places in prices between the high and the low where the market wasn't efficiently offered for buyers there wasn't much time and back and forth pricing to give buyers an opportunity to get in there and participate so an efficient market we'll see the market go back up and repic that so it's down and then right back up like paint being applied to a roller on a wall you want to make sure you go back and forth to deposit the paint evenly so there's an even distribution so again the background of this chart that's the wall and every one of these candles is a paint roller and whenever you see these big long drawn out candles there's a strong tendency not all the time but there's a strong tendency for the price to go right back up and overlap over that that entire range same thing over here we have the market drop down creates a fair value Gap here doesn't it take out some lows over here yes there's displacement and then you can have an order to get in short here but then watch what happens this little pump up that might be scary it could have stopped you out if it went higher that's the risk in this folks I'm not going to give you a silver bullet that removes losing trades I lose trades too you're going to miss moves I miss moves okay you're going to read it wrong I read it wrong sometimes okay I'm not perfect but I'm giving you tools and processes to help you determine where the most likely scenario is going to be and then you just work those statistical odds and hopefully with sound money management which I'll cover which will hopefully get you to the Winter Circle more often than not all right so we have the morning session starting before 8:30 we have a rally up and then it breaks lower in this area here we're going to have to drop down to a lower time frame but before I do I want to give you a little bit more details think about what I've taught you so far in this teaching for power 3 the accumulation manipulation and distribution cycle of the daily range if we are trading near the high end of that fair value gap on the daily chart that's what that level is okay when we just drop down to a lower time frame chart so with this 15minute time frame chart and I apologize the chart's a little bit shifted it's still the same chart I just added the annotations the idea is we're expecting this power three formation where it's open rally create the high of the day sell off and close near the low that's what we're looking for why would that bias be expected on this day because we worked the upper end of that fair value gap on the daily chart then we had multiple shifts in Market structure bearishly when we already have a bearish bias on the daily chart anyway so it gives you a high probability that this day is going to be a down close day it may not close on the low it might just be a big down move and that's all you need you just need movement so this level here it's Dash that's the midnight New York opening price this is what I'm referring to when I'm looking at the opening or power three on a daily chart that price right there at midnight look what's occurring that right there is equivalent to this little tick on this diagram here it opens it trades above the opening just like that candle does on a daily chart it opens and goes is higher you want to be selling short here why would you want to go short here well it went back up in the air and redelivered the down stroke on that paintbrush or or roller on the wall well now it's going back up when it's going up like that it feels unnatural to go short like you don't want to sell short it's like this thing's going up why would I want to go in there and go short that's the benefit of studying old data and then reading price studying it real time and without taking any demo trades without trying to pick the you know the targets forget all that you want to practice for months reading the tape studying price action watching it even if you have to watch it with trading views Market replay function there's nothing inherently wrong with it if that's all you have and you can't watch it live but it is alltogether something different and much more beneficial if you can watch the actual live data so as I mentioned in my own paid mentorship I always counsel my students to if they have the means to do so invest in like like I have Cam Asia Camtasia is what I use to make these videos it's through techsmith and techsmith you can Google them it's pretty inexpensive it's easy platform to use and I have had had wonderful results with it I don't have any complaints I've done all the upgrades every time they have it it's just really good if you have a job or if you have a business that you're running or if you go to school or if you just got to sleep if if the time zones don't line up for you you can set up a recording and just let it record for 8 hours it'll do it and as long as have space in your computer it'll do it and then you can go back and literally play that time real time and watch the candle paint unlike trading views replay function where it doesn't give you the EB and flow of the candlesticks forming it's just basically the opening and then a closing of what the candle did it's kind of clunky and wooden it doesn't really give you that uh organic feel of the candlesticks actually forming real time whereas if you recorded your screen doing it then here it is don't worry about your screen burn in time either uh Camtasia will record the screen if your screen protector comes on and like goes blank it'll still record the screen all right so we're looking at the opening price here and then we're expecting a sell the form well here's that fair value got it rallies up into that isn't that a sell above the opening price yep mhm sure is from that opening price to that High that's the highest high take that range and subtract it from the opening price that's about in this vicinity here okay right in there so what's occurring well we have this cell here then we have this cell here at the open at the equities opening and then we have this imbalance in here so from this Range High to that low multiply that by two as a projection other words whatever that low is to that high that much lower you'll expect to see a short and it forms right here that's exactly what I taught you I did not cherry-pick that folks you can go back and look at data as long as you can find data on daily charts okay and if you can get a intraday chart like an hourly chart you'll see it it's there but this is a 15-minute time frame that's my bell weather chart that's what I teach all my students this is the one you go to for day trades and or scalps you can find everything for intraday trading on a 15-minute time frame if I was held to a decision of what time frame would you be forced to trade with if you had to pick just one ICT the 15-minute time frame because I can I can do anything with that 15minute time frame I can swing trade I can short-term trade I can day trade I can scalp but you only need to have one discipline one way of doing it and you might not like the 15minute time frame you might like the one minute chart if you're trading indices but you have to have the storyline of the 15-minute time frame to get the full panoramic view of what price is likely to do so with this continued teaching here right below here what's that at sell side liquidity relative equal lows so you can test this on your own chart I admitted it by mistake I apologize but the low on this candle here is 14381 even okay don't take my word for it go look at your own chart it's there so 14, 381 I would have preferred to include a line projecting that out in time because you'll see in a moment when we drop down the lower time frame but the setups are forming here above the opening price right here near the opening price see that and inside of the range from the high to the opening projected down it's in that vicinity there so it's giving you another opportunity so again what's occurred is we went up into that fair value gap on the daily chart we're back on the daily chart again and we're anticipating the opening and rallying up into what maybe the high end of that fair value Gap or something forming at the news release at 8:30 but if we look at price price was starting to pump up higher ahead of the 8:30 news release so what's that tipping its hand to you telling you they're pricing in a premium Market ahead of the news so they're going to use the news to sink it lower because the bearish bias is going to come into to fruition they're going to expand price lower and they've already established their shorts because they accumulated above the opening price and we can see that in the price action of each little short-term rally up like we're looking at here so here's 7:00 in the morning it rallies above these relative equal highs and cleans up the imbalance here and look at that right there see that remember what I told you if there's two fair value gaps try to trade it in here but anticipate and use the money management to allow for your stock to weather a run up into that and we got it right there now strip it down to what I taught you for the structure of the trade or the framework swing High broken to the upside taking out buy stops so buy side liquidity is taken then we have a swing low it's broken did these candles come down lethargically was it like a slow meand or decline no it was sudden it was a lot of momentum it was energetic you can't miss those down closed candles right there that's obvious they stand out right so that's how you know you have a shift in Market structure in this area here it doesn't have a fair value Gap that's okay this is only a 5-minute chart this is where we started doing a top down strip of 5 minute 4 minute 3 minute 2 minute 1 minute the first fair value G we come to if we find one on a four minute you don't need to go down to a three you don't need to go down to a two you don't need to go down to a one if you go down to a four you don't see one you go down to a three if you find one there you don't go any lower okay if you don't find one on the five the four or the three and you go down to the two minute and you find it there that's it you don't go down to the one minute if you don't find it on a two-minute and you do find it on a one minute then there that's how you trade it but what if you don't have one on the one minute chart you don't have a trade how's that for logic so we have the continuation lower off of a retracement in here now this candle the high of it here I wish I would have use a lighter color but this candle's high is right there okay it actually goes just above that one right there not by much but it does but we don't need that we don't need that Watch What Happens here's the 4minute chart uh oh something different on this chart ain't it we have bide liquidity here the candles are a little bit more beefier when we were looking at the previous slide look at this one look at the candles are look wonky don't they but on this time frame they become much more prominent more beefy much more Stout like look at me I'm here take a take a look at me that's what we're looking for we're looking for clean price action where we can see the nice Candlestick formations where we're seeing the even distribution of the price going higher or lower in this case going lower but we're seeing that little break where there's not an even distribution of price that's the fair value got so we have that run above byet liquidity after rebalancing over here it goes above it and it breaks down so we have an idea okay we could potentially see a a trade short here I like this fair value gy but we also have a little bit of imbalance in here so I want to trade in here but my money management has to permit me to weather a run up into this area too remember that that's part of the rules but in here we're going a little bit deeper in my YouTube channel I teach a breaker pattern okay and that is a high a low and a higher high that's what this pattern is here and we're seeing that return here so if I see a breaker like this yes I think the market could potentially trade up into here but I'm going to use the breaker's candle and just above that for my stop so I'm not going to go way up here or way up in here cuz my Foundation to teaching the ICT breaker is the Market's going to mostly stay in the lower half of the breaker candle which is the down down Clos candle rate for the big move up higher taking out a short-term High trust me the breaker is taught in the YouTube channel in other lessons I'm not going to pour myself over top of lessons and regurgitate things because there's a lot of you that have been training with me for a long time and you don't want to go through that and the new people that are here I understand your enthusiasm and you want to know everything like a SP I get it and I love it but trust me when I tell you that is taught in the free lessons in this YouTube channel okay just remember it's a bearish breaker and that pattern is the support structure of why I would not expect it to have have a higher stop up here okay so here's the fair value got range from the low and the high end but it's specifically this candle's low and this candle's high right there extend that out in time look what happens at eight 28 the candle showing 828 here because it's a 4minute chart but once we're trading inside here all I need to do is trade Above This candle's High I want to be short I don't want to mess around it might not give me an opportunity to get in it might not go higher up into that fair value guy I want to use the easiest lowest threshold entry technique to get in to make sure I'm a part of the move then I'm going to be aiming for those relative equal lows that's that 14381 level 14381 remember that relative equal lows I said I wish I would have put a line on it this is the time frame I added the line it's the 4-minute chart now if you look real close you can see there's a little tiny little arrow right there and a bunch of them over here what that is is trading views paper trading module and I put some short on this today to illustrate what many of you have been asking me in trading view comment section A lot of you send me comments through trading View and I apologize I don't get to them a lot because there's a lot of them usually that happen and I just don't get to them I'm sorry I'm not purposely trying to ignore you it's like telegram telegram people send me messages there too and I just don't I don't have time to go through it emails absolutely I don't have a whole lot of time to get through because everybody wants to write a long story to me and I appreciate them but I just can't I can't sit there all day long and read all that but the idea of showing what a discount broker margin what what could I do with that okay I don't recommend it but there are Brokers out there that will allow you to trade the mini contract for just a couple thousand and the micro for less than a 100 bucks and to me that is absolutely stupid you're asking to blow the account in these markets you absolutely can have your hinder Parts handed to you in short sudden fashion even me in the last I don't know four weeks or so I've seen moves that came back on my stop so fast I was like wow just the other day I watched a 100o Run come out of nowhere in a one minute candle it moved 100 points in the NASDAQ one minute that's a lot of movement man so if you're looking at that and you're trying to hold let's say I don't know 16 minis or eight Minis and it moves $2,000 against you in one minute folks your stop would not have been respected it was literally way above your stop- loss if you were using one okay so you would have got stopped out with negative slippage and let's say you were holding those eight contracts well let's say you got burned for 50 points in slippage and you don't think that's possible oh it's there 50 points just like this that's $1,000 times your eight contracts you just lost $88,000 and you're going to tell me that you can open up an account with a I don't know $10,000 whatever and you're going to trade multiple minis because the discount broker allows you to and all of a sudden you just roasted your account in one trade and some wild little price move that came out of nowhere that you didn't expect and in one candle one minute candle it just smoked your account just like that there's teachers out there that are promoting the idea that that's a good idea it's not a good idea folks $10,000 that's the absolute minimum and I don't think it should be that I think it should be a little bit higher than that I think 15 ,000 is fair for what the NASDAQ is doing right now because just today alone moved 8,000 per for one single count contract over $88,000 in movement for one contract now that's you know top to bottom and likck of you being in that move is probably you know obviously not likely but the measure of risk needs to be appreciated and respected and unfortunately YouTube makes it a available for anybody to come out here and pretend to know what they're doing and unfortunately if that person isn't skilled if they don't really do what they say they do or or teach proper risk or to teach you to respect the level of risk that's required to trade these markets they're doing you a disservice and that's the number one reason why I taught for a long time with a demo and still teach with a demo because number one legal reasons I'm not trying to be held liable because I'm not licensed to get trade advice but it's not trade advice in a demo account you're not making or losing anything it's fantasy football with price charts but you can learn how to read price action with it this year I've been showing you a live account that's real I'm not teaching through that notice that okay at the end of the year I'm going to share with you what that account has done I'll be 100% transparent I will show you line by line every single trade from every single Trading day of every single trading week of every month you'll see it okay throughout the year I'm going to be teaching lessons about certain things and you're going to see them applied when I share the entire history with that account so it's more meaningful CU there's a lot of you in the comment sections that are trolling and I I know what you're here for but I'm going to give you undeniable proof just like the rest of you that way you can see the lessons I'm giving you yes they worked in demo but they're actually being utilized in live fund trading by me it's after the fact so I cannot be accused of giving you trade advice it's what I did with my real money see the difference there it is what it is if you don't like this teaching style there's other people out there teaching all kinds of great stuff doesn't mean it's profitable but they got all kinds of neat stuff to look at I'm teaching you how to read price and I need you to be sober minded about the level of risk that these markets provide us because it can take you out quickly so I got questioned by I don't know six or seven of the people some of them are actually my students in the mentorship and others are just people that are on the internet you I don't know if they're just YouTube or if they're just trading VI you people that try to follow me on there but they asked could I showcase what I would do with a $10,000 hypothetical account if I was using a discount broker in other words a broker that would let me trade with I don't know like $2,000 or $1,500 per contract something to that effect for a NASDAQ mini contract number one it was crazy trying to find some of those setups because to frame the risk in it and to do Big Lot sizes too was very challenging but I kept it lowend it only took me two weeks to do this but you can see I put a heavy-handed short up here using what I'm teaching you here and then aiming for there's relative equal loads which is that 14381 level this is my trading VI account now you're going to hear people say this is photoshopped oh you photoshopped this no I did not I don't need to photoshop this in fact my live mentorship with real students that paid me they're going to see me show this live and it's going to move all around it's not edited I'm going to log out of the account and log back in so it's not me doing any kind of editing it's not mt4 servers or anything like that you can play around with it's not ninja Trader you can go in there and take a bad trade out make it look good all these things here are executions okay and you can see there's three losing trades there on the 14th and where's you can see today's trades all up at the top and that was me doing a heavy-handed a uh Quant style heavy-handed short and then taking partials as it was going down into that level of 14381 looking at this this is your classic you know the guy shows you the results okay shows you this is what I did with my demo account they may lie and say it's a real account this is clearly a paper trading account you can see it it's there it says it right up here paper trading okay paper trading this is all paper money okay I started the account with trading View at $10,000 okay and that was on February 3rd just two weeks ago to the day okay so two Thursdays ago I started this and set the account to start with $10,000 then I started trading it and you can see the positions here with just the NASDAQ okay I'm not doing anything with like Forex to make it go up I'm not trying to pull out bonds I'm not trying to do anything like that I'm showing you just the NASDAQ starting with $10,000 in two weeks using again the limitations of well I guess I don't want to say limitations the pseudo benefit of a discount broker what could I do in two weeks doing that and using what I'm teaching you too that's the difference I'm literally teaching what I'm showing here I just showed you the example of it in the chart before this is the equivalent of 582 in 2 weeks now it's hypothetically done in paper trading yes but with the perspective of a hypothetical discount broker margin being used so whereas I'm trading with tdmr trade right now and they require me to have almost 20 $2,000 to trade one contract I don't have a problem with that because of the level of volatility that's in there it just makes it easy for me not to worry about it like I'm not worried about it I know I got plenty of margin I know I got plenty of equity if I get banged by something come out of nowhere say Russia goes into Ukraine or China invades Taiwan or something crazy comes out and it crosses the market to go nuts because I expect that to be coming anytime now it won't smoke my account okay I'm not gonna I'm not going to blow the account I guarantee you this account's not blowing okay and I'm showing in my opinion what it would be like for someone if they ever got to the point where they put years into developing their own model now that doesn't mean you can't find profitability before that but after you've done it for a while and you found your own niche of what you want to do with the content I'm teaching you you'll find your own Groove and once that's done and you can formulate a well- written model on paper where everything is outlined when do you buy when do you sell where do you put your stop at when do you move your stop how many contracts do you trade you know what constitutes a day where you don't take a trade all those types of things I will teach you those lessons in this YouTube mentorship okay a lot of you also are very very excited and you're like okay I I see you doing this but I'm not really learning anything new I'm disappointed I'm not done you give me those complaints after I say I'm done okay but I'm giving you gold like this is something that you can go out there and turn in these markets and really develop a skill set that could completely change your whole entire Direction in your life I'm not promising profitability notice that see that I'm not promising that I'm not promising you a sixf figure income every year I'm not doing that either I'm telling you that you will love price action because it repeats it's something that's well it repeats and if you know something's going to repeat it's familiar and things that are familiar are comfortable right now you don't know what these patterns are likely to do you're they're unfamiliar to you so it's it's important for you to understand that that's a temporary struggling point but going through the things I'm going to teach you to do here and I'm streamlining it yes this doesn't feel like streamlining to some of you you want me to come out here and say this is where you buy this is where you sell you put put your stop loss right here and this is where you take your profits and it's always like this every single time wash rinse repeat and it never violates any of those rules and it's just always the same way if you think that way just change this channel right now don't even come back here because that's not reality there's going to be similarities that look slightly different than the last few times you took the trade but you will recognize them but my question to you is if you could do this over a year not two weeks would you be impressed with yourself if you could do that would you feel that that would be enough some of you young guys don't think that this is enough and it's amazing that type of return is amazing if you can t if you can turn that with a live account that's phenomenal like that's that's wealth making there you don't need to be that high to make money but if you can hit that kind of number a year over 12 months hit something like that that's amazing and that's not even what I teach my students to expect and I'm not this is not bragging I'm not trying to say look at me I can trade a demo account look at me that's not what I'm doing here folks okay I was asked sincerely to show you all hear me telling you and I'm sh I'm showing you it's a paper trading account because I'm not going to go into amp or some other broker that's going to allow me to trade with discount broker margins I'm not going to do it I know I know even what I know I'm going to get smoked if I try to do something crazy and heavy-handed because even with me trading one contract I've had moves come against me pretty sudden and there was nothing I could have done about it because the volatility is so Fierce right now I'm not afraid of it but I do absolutely respect it so to provide a answer to the guys out there that say that yeah you it's stupid to trade in another account where they use the exchange rate margins for initial margins which is right now almost $22,000 for the NASDAQ One Mini contract you need about $222,000 it was about $17,604.13 listen this is for your notes okay if they raise the margins that's the exchange tipping their hand to you that huge moves are coming big monstrous moves are coming and they just raised the margins you think that's coincidence it's not big moves are coming and if you're offside it's going to get real hot in the Underpants but if you're on side man there ain't nothing sweeter than that that's like winning a lottery and these moves are significant I mean let's go back up for a second okay and I'll close this video if you look at the fair value Gap in here okay and say you're filled at 14,515 and you're aiming for 14, 381 is that 6 and a half points no is it 20 no no is it 50 mm- is it 100 nope it's more do you see a pattern here one contract folks what I'm teaching you is literally a ATM machine in your hands I'm giving you the PIN numbers every time I do a video here I'm giving you another digit and once you figure out what it is that you want to do with this content and make it part of you and you'll see what I mean by that right now you might see me showing you it's like man this makes perfect sense most of the comments that I don't allow to be posted are just sugar sweet diabetic coma type lovey doy comments and I'm not making fun of that and I appreciate I know what you mean by it and you want to show your adoration and respect I love that but don't lose sight that you're feeling that Splash over because I'm literally taking you into the chart and showing you what I know and you're excited because you know the opportunity is available to you if you stick to this and that's the right perspective but don't lose sight and think that I just watch that video and I'm going to go out there and trade because I've had some people post in the comment section and they try to do something with Live accounts which I already said no don't do that and they're saying I I don't think these Concepts work because I try to do this and I tried to buy this fair value Gap today and you know who you are and I'm not trying to make fun of you I'm not talking down to you but the bias is bearish so if the bias is bearish would you go in looking for a bullish fair value Gap no that's that's the purpose of having a model and in with that model each morning before the markets even start trading you write down what your intentions are what does that mean I gave you the range right here's the opening price it rallies up to that so inside that range you're going to look for a set out to go short you're bearish and if it goes down below that low you can still take a short if it's in this range minus this low okay if it leaves that area you can't chase it I don't care how good it looks later in the day you don't do it you have to have discipline folks if you don't have discipline your broker's not going to help you with that they want you to click that button that's how you make money and they don't care if you blow your account because there's going to be 20 more to replace you because they watch watched ICT videos they've watched everybody else on YouTube that try to tell you that you can do this and it's so easy even a pizza delivery boy can do it so hopefully this has helped clear up the idea of bias and power three and I will be repeating these themes when it's applicable in the newer videos that come out and examples I'm going to teach with but for now I can't say it enough what you were just exposed to that is the underpinnings of what we do in my Camp okay ICT my students we look at Price like that let me throw one more thing in here just to piss off everybody that doesn't like these long videos let me go back up in this area real quick and on the daily chart with the candlesticks is what I'm looking for here here we go all right notice something from this low up to this high it's bullish okay we're expecting bullish prices this is how you back test you tell yourself in your annotations I was expecting you're you're basically lying to yourself in the in the comments of your chart when you're back testing it sounds foolish okay trolls are going to love that comment coming out of my mouth but what you're doing is is you're teaching yourself SU experience it's training your subconscious to see this stuff like you saw it live and when you record it on the chart in your own annotations and you log it and you keep it in your journal and on the weekend you go back and look at your Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday and and you look at the previous week and you start looking at these patterns and how it repeats over and over again when it's bullish you're trying to stay with the opposite of this open near the low close near the high but expansion to the upside so accumulate Longs manipulate get people thinking it's going to go lower and then Ram it up higher distribute the Longs near the close that's what you're looking for here with that mindset okay you're all afraid of but what happens if it's a down day ICT what happens well the worst thing it can happen is you lose money and if you think that you're going to trade and not ever lose money turning the videos off don't ever watch anybody else's either because that's not a proper mindset Traders are professional losers they're managing every trade right from the beginning they got to come out of the costs you're paying a commission and if you got slipped in Forex you got to spread every trade opens up as a loser so a Trader is a professional management company of losing trades they turn losers into winners but not every loser can be turned into a winner but they don't lose their business because a few never become winners it's real important to understand that folks it's a paradigm shift that took place when I was a younger man I felt that there was a way for me to always win I was convinced of it there isn't there is no way of doing that okay so last analogy last lesson and the video is over if we're bullish here okay we're expecting each candle to expand higher so in other words the close be higher than the opening on each individual candle my up candles are green how many black or down Clos candles do you see in this price run two wow how about this price moveed here it's going lower right going down for the sell side here you're bearish but what happens ICT if it goes up you'll probably lose money but let's count how many up closed candle we have one two 3 four five look how much range it moved if you can't have a model that weathers say you got a losing trade each one of those days if that blows your account you're not managing your risk properly you're overleveraging or overtrading see how easy that is to deduce your problems it's simple stuff folks but you're you're scaring yourself you're overthinking things you're listening to me talk about multiple Concepts that will come together in a few weeks but you're overthinking everything and you're trying to assume just because you watched a few videos and you're thinking foolishly that just by watching a few of these videos we're only in episode 10 10 episodes and some of you think you can go out there and own the world now I understand it's empowering information if you've never been in uced to it but you're not going to own the world up to episode 10 okay you're not going to do that you're going to lose money if you go out there and try to rush to try to do this stuff there's a lot of things we still have to cover and you haven't even back tested enough I haven't even been teaching it long enough on YouTube for you to even have a backlog of data to draw experience from so think about that okay trust me when I tell you folks these moves repeat all the time all the time and don't feel like you're missing out because you're not doing it right now put that feeling aside make this fun while you're learning it and it'll never feel like a job or a tedious task that's going to be it for this one hopefully it was insightful to you and until I'll talk to you next Tuesday enjoy your weekend and be safe

all right folks welcome back a little bit earlier broadcast today has some plans this evening so i want to get it out of the way all right so we're looking at obviously a hindsight view of something i pointed to before it happened so that way you guys got a chance to see what it was like for my private mentorship group when i say these things it's almost like an invitation for some of you to email me to ask to join out you can't join it okay i'm teaching mentorship on youtube okay so that way you don't need to reach out to me okay it's i'm teaching right here and you didn't have to send me any credit card information you'd have to set up any kind of paypal account there's nothing to worry about you either watch it and enjoy it and get something from it or you never come back and watch anymore okay it's very simple but i'm getting a lot of feedback from the comments and it's been very positive so thank you for that it's very encouraging all right so we're looking at the e-mini nasdaq futures contract for the march delivery if you remember i was outlining this imbalance in here okay and i gave you the high of this candle below that candle which it should be sitting right on that so with this imbalance we traded down to a discount back up to a premium again measure the high to the low and i'll do that for you now because i know somebody like can you just do it for me all right so here's 50 that's equilibrium inside this dealing range high and low so we traded from these lows up into a premium above 50 below 50 is a discount up here we tried to rally up above this high failed broke back down below 50 percent and then created a gap okay so it comes up back into a premium market above 50 and fills in the gap i mentioned how this type of retracement can lull traders into likely thinking it's going to go higher but we're thinking down here okay the liquidity resting below here is what they're going to attack so all of this consolidation just sets up another selling opportunity to run down there and again you're welcome to go back and listen to the previous discussions and you'll hear me basically say that we're going down here all right so it needs to rebalance this first and it spends three days in that range notice that then it releases the downside attacks the cell side here and trades into the cell cell liquidity resting below here so let's go into a lower time frame hourly chart and fared out some more information and details all right so here is the hourly chart you can see that high end of the fair value gap and the low end of the favorite gap we traded up into that sold off consolidated sold off once more and you watched me share on the community tab my live trades from yesterday it was traded through td ameritrade it was not a demo account okay so i want to go into what i used what i saw and then obviously i'll show you in the account where the details were okay all right so the market started trading rallied up took out a short-term high on friday see that then started the breakdown now the overnight i was watching this but i was hoping that it didn't take out that low before the morning i wanted to see it trade up here take the high out and then consolidate after running below that short term low i didn't want it to be in a hurry before the new york session in the morning because that would have set up a nice short up here where i could have taken a run under this low and then see if i can capture a re-entry which is the entry you'll actually see me do and then the drop down in here now on monday it was a bank holiday and trading stops at one o'clock in the afternoon on holidays generally and resumes around six o'clock in the afternoon new york time and when we stopped here we had already moved aggressively lower and stopped right there so i felt very strongly that we were going to gap down below it and it gave just a beautiful gap lower and run immediately but i was looking at the 13 5 ninety thirteen five eighty six level real time and i couldn't get to my screen fast enough to close it out there and i didn't wanna put a limit order in because if it got really far down below and started running you know really lower with a lot of speed and such i didn't want to limit my profitable exit with having a limit order in so i just left it open-ended and i wanted to see how far it would reach down in there by the time i closed the trade it closed me at thirteen thousand six twelve and a quarter so my entry was thirteen thousand eight fifty eight and a quarter the exit was thirteen thousand six twelve and a quarter that's not a little bit of ticks okay 204 some plus handles so you take that 240 sum times that by four there's your tick value for those like to keep counting them you're going to drop down into a 15 minute time frame all right so we had that run on friday's high here to break down and at 10 30 in the morning 10 33 was the actual fill so it's right in that candle right in here i'm trading in that candle going short so we're going to go into the details and look at why that was the case and again you'll see the live account log in in the business okay so just hold on to your horses if that's the attitude you have right now oh you in the hindsight so we're going to go into a five-minute chart start going down into the details here this is a little bit taller so that way you can appreciate the imbalances that are being shown all right so we had this rally up which in my mind was acting like a judah swing in the morning okay so here's 8 30 it starts to run higher so i want to be in going short at this candles opening and you can see that well maybe you can't see it the opening price over here okay here is 8 30's candle right there the opening at 13 7 98 and a half so i want to be preferably going short something above that price okay so i'm anticipating further weakness and before i go any further in this one i got several people probably about half a dozen or so mentioning their confusion with why i mentioned the opening price at new york at midnight and in the opening price at 8 30 in the morning there's two reference points being specifically dealt with there if you're looking at the entire daily range you're going to use the opening price at midnight but if you're going to be looking at the morning session you're going to be looking at the 8 30 in the morning opening price okay so hopefully it's made a distinction there don't worry i have a market structured lesson coming up on thursday that will further solidify and remove all doubts and concerns about that okay but for now let's just go through this one so 8 30 in the morning the opening price i'm bearish i'm thinking we're going to go down below that green level there that's the old daily low so on this candle here at 8 30 i'm expecting all this being a fake rally it's something to lull in traders that chase it going higher the retracement people that don't really understand order blocks they're going to say look at that it's a down closed candle i'm going to buy that and then when it starts to go up like that they feel wow this is really easy every down closed candle after a run-up is a bullshore block it's not in here is the real context okay we have an imbalance there and that's what i'm looking at i'm looking at this imbalance right there so i'm trying to operate inside that range for a short now i know because of the volatility it can color outside the lines and it's okay the bodies of the candles are kind of supporting the idea of what i'm looking for but the wicks i could care less about because i want to get in when it's ideal and i'm going to show you what that was looking like for me at the time so we're going to drop down into a four-minute chart okay so here is that imbalance and fair value gap on the five-minute chart but now it's a little skewed because it takes up two candles to show that range the market trades up and right in that candle that one right there that's where i'm going short i got in at 10 33 okay that was my short dropping down into a three minute chart okay the market trades up works inside that imbalance and right there 10 33 that candle when it's starting to bump up against the top end of that fair value got right there as it hits that and starts to move away i'm in there i'm going short right there the reason why i'm trusting that and not thinking it's going to go higher is because we have this high here okay and then we have this high here which highs higher this one or that one obviously this one now this candle is high watch what happens from this high we have a short-term swing high next to it here and then we have one here so this one makes a intermediate term high so we have a long-term intraday on a three-minute chart which sounds like an oxymoron though but long-term high intermediate term high because this high is lower than that one but we have a swing high here and here that are lower both being lower than this one then we have the same context right here we have a high with a lower high on either side of it so i have market structure behind me showing that this is number one it's a bearish market because my draw and liquidity is down here it hasn't traded down there yet okay so it's gonna act like a big magnet so all these fluctuations in here without understanding what i'm showing you it's gonna feel like it's just noise it's chop it's not it's actually telling you exactly what it's going to do so the swing high here is an intermediate term swing high so i want to be going short real close to this high because it's likely to break like it does here so at 10 33 when it hits the upper end of that fair value got i have at now at this moment go back one candle we have this high a higher high and a lower high so we have a high with a lower high on either side of it that's a swing high that is lower than this one that is lower than that one so it's far more than just oh he's just looking at lower lows lower highs that's what a myopic individual would come and watch this so like when they see me put a rectangle in the chart they're saying oh it's supply and demand it's not there's so many more factors involved that it's just not even in the same vicinity okay so sparing all that compare and contrast because i've done a lot of that already on the videos on this youtube channel the elements of intermediate term short-term highs i learned that from larry williams okay that mode of deciphering market structure he taught that in a video course that i bought back in the early 90s and it was a video course that i mentioned many times in this youtube channel the future millionaires confidential trading course something to that effect it was for vhs tapes and when he talked about market structure it kind of went over my head the first few times listening to it like i didn't really understand what he was showing until i started literally going into the charts and saying okay here's a swing high and this is how you learn it okay because trust me watching this video or watching someone else parrot what i say and then say wow he did it in five minutes he's teaching it better that's not it's not jealousy me saying that i'm telling you you have no idea what you're doing you're not even teaching it correctly and those that believe that they're learning it correctly are going out there and wrecking themselves what you're looking at is a price chart with a directional bias okay something that's leading to a draw on liquidity so i've already told you last week that we were going to go below that green line that's where we were heading so what you're doing is you're looking at all the swing highs and every time you see a swing high on a song high is simply a high that has a lower high candle to the left of it and a lower high candle to the right of it and then one in the middle that's your swing high note that okay in the old days when we printed out our charts and such and we had chart books delivered to us we would get them once a week they would give us the friday's closing data and all the daily candles and then until we got our new updated chart book we had to hand draw in the open high low and close on the charts when the markets say we were following so whenever we saw a swing high or swing low we would just put a little ring above it little circle okay like a little halo and that would be a short term high now i would do a double circle or double halo for an intermediate term high and then three halos for a long term swing high so that way when i'm looking at price it allows me to classify the level of high that is forming so it's not just lower low low or high no you got to look at the nesting effect of the highs and lows and again that concept i learned from larry williams in the early 90s he talks a little bit about it in his book how i made a million dollar trading commodities last year which i believe is absolutely still essential reading even though there's a lot of things in that book i think is just fluff and just like all the moon phases and things i'm not into all that stuff but his chapters on market structure and his million dollar trading concepts those ideas and that premise behind it they are still true today and they probably will always be true so if you don't have that book my recommendation is to get it go and get it where we can i'm not going to put any kind of affiliate links up that way you can't think i'm making any money by showing his uh his books i just think it's a really good book and at least once a year i go through and read it just for nostalgia reasons but i got it pretty much remembered verbatim but by looking at that relationship of the highs i trusted this because we had a swing high here already in effect and i know this candle here is not likely to go above this one because this one didn't go above that one and this one didn't go above that one not because it's lower lows and lower highs there's much more going on underneath the the surface than just lower lows and lower highs that's just it's cringy when you hear people talk like that and they try to reduce it down to something like that or it's a support resistance idea it's just by the floor and sell the ceiling okay or why does an ict look at this trade over here industry because those trades are being referred to in hindsight by those people that talk like that i'm literally taking live trades i'm taking them i'm executing on them and i know why i'm doing it i'm not guessing i'm not trying to figure out or deciphering what it is after i get into trade i know what i'm looking for and i know why i'm waiting for it that is something that you learn by developing patients and trusting a model the only way you trust it is to go through back testing look at all these price action moves and start classifying the swing highs and swing lows i will amplify what i just talked about here on thursday's lesson okay because thursday's lesson is going to be on market structure okay i'm going to teach a lot of people out there to think they know market structure they don't really know that much at all actually but if this is the candle i'm trying to get in at and i execute on with all the understanding of this outline there i want to see displacement we get it here now if i didn't take this trade here i could trade with the return back to this right here why why is that possible we have a swing high it's broken to the upside this low is taken out here this candle is high here if it touches that again i can be short there just using the imbalance in the fair value gap entry technique i'm teaching you so i can go there and get short or i want to get up here as close as i can to that important high that i've already outlined here so i want to be in that and wait for that initial move because then when this occurs when you're that high up in the well the session high so at 8 30 right there this run up i'm real close to this high by entering there notice that i'm not waiting for a breakout below that low so i'm getting up in there where it's an optimal entry i don't need to get the highest high you don't need to get the highest high but you need to understand why it should be trading away from the levels you're trying to enter at and that's kind of like what i'm showing you here i'm hinting at a deeper lesson i'll give you on thursday but the displacement comes which is what i was waiting for and it gives you a confirmation when this occurs it's just almost like okay just sit back and just relax and just let it do its thing now monday again was a holiday so i knew i had abbreviated session hours so it's going to close at one o'clock so that's right in here and then next candle obviously would be one o'clock and it's not trading so it closed but it closed here ahead of one o'clock and then the holiday session closing at 1 pm in new york local time and the low that green level here remember go back to the daily chart at the beginning of the video and what we were referring to last week the liquidity the cell stops below this green line that's where it was going to attack okay and it came in and did so it opened up six o'clock in new york time opened up and slammed down accelerating lower that is the move that you want to see being short up here and covering down below here once it does that and it runs into it low deep that's it take your profits and move the sidelines and then wait because you have a big gap here it's likely to come back and rebalance that and fill it in and it does and then ultimately trades around that old low and eventually pumps up into the afternoon consolidates then goes into the early morning afternoon hours right there and i showed how this setup because after a big move you don't want to trade in the morning session just don't do it and i purposely go into a demo account to appease that desire to want to trade so i don't burn the account i don't take the heat off of a nice win and replace it or dampen it by taking a losing trade in my history in the last 30 years i've been fortunate enough to know how i have hurt myself those things are the things that i like to mentor with but those are also the lessons that everybody complains about until they lose money and then they come back to me and they're like i wish i would listen so i get it you know everybody has their own interpretation of what they should be doing how they should be learning it but you know i've lived it you're just now the you're learning about it so when i have a nice winning day as you'll see it was a nice little win um i'm not gonna hurry to go back in and then you have these days here where it can trip you up you don't know what's going on you don't know what's likely to occur so i went in and i demo traded and used again quote unquote discount broker leverage to compare and contrast those fellows out there that like to work in their market replay and paper trade their stuff with ninjatrader and then you know compare and contrast you know what i'm doing with trading view so it kind of like scratches an itch and it keeps me out of trouble with a live account because if you catch a good lick in the marketplace and you've had winning trades or you caught a really nice winning trade that you had to wait for the setup to pan out when that occurs if you're new you have an impulsive tendency to want to go back in immediately and get that dopamine hit again i i did something right you know i made money when i was a younger man i did that and i had some really nice run-ups in the account and then boom i get a really big winning trade all of a sudden i feel like it wasn't enough because i was so low nobody around me was supporting me i had no support structure around me none i didn't have anybody saying hey what you do is awesome you don't need to worry about anymore so it was just me saying i had to do more so one of the mental hurdles you're going to have to contend with is knowing when enough is enough and when you've made money real money in a live account you just don't want to rush to get back in there again you get folks out there that sit on social media and say you know you got to push your edge no you don't want to push your edge because if you keep pushing your edge you're gonna dull it you sharpen it by knowing when to get in when to get out and you don't dull your edge okay so when i hear people talk like that i already know they're not profitable i know they're not profitable because they're gamblers and they want to sound like they're doing something all the time and they're not and if they are they're doing it probably unprofitably so this morning after 9 30 again what's the bias bearish that has not changed even though we had this run up it hasn't changed so at 9 30 equity is open after consolidation it runs up creates a high and then runs up again takes out the high that right there is your run on stops wait to see if it wants to break down it does so we're going to look at that and refer back to the video i just put a little short video up uh this morning and outlined the whole business there i don't want to do it here because this is rehashing what i already showed in a very short one minute or so video but ultimately right in here we have a nice little selling opportunity and you can attack the fair value gap in here between the low and the high right there it would be and if you want to trade with the longer term bias you could attack the cell side liquidity resting below here and here because they're relative equal lows and then you would have got a nice fill there as well so i teach in a manner that allows my students to pick number one the style or trader they want to be they want to be a day trader they want to be a scalper do you want to be intraday swing trader if they want to be a short-term trader where you're holding over you know overnight or if you want to be a daily chart swing trader or four-hour chart swing trader where you're holding you for a week or more or if you want to do a position trader which to me is i don't have i don't have that mentality to do that i have too many things that show up on a chart that make me change my mind all the time so i have a lot more opportunities because i think short term and i excel in the short term it does not mean that that is not a profitable way of trading when it's position trading because i don't match that personality wise so i like to excel where i'm strongest and it's in intraday trading and i can run the account pretty quick with velocity i can get in get short-term moves and just parlay them out real quick which is kind of like what i was demonstrating you know facetiously this morning with the one minute video thumbing my news at the quan so we're looking at the likelihood of potentially going back down below that level again if it does it'll probably start to accelerate i like 13 thousand three hundred if we get you know on a roll going lower i like that one and maybe even if we get really excited it can trade down into twelve thousands okay twelve thousand eight fifty twelve thousand eight seventy five in that area so just something to think about i'm not suggesting you should take a trade in it or not but just thinking out loud uh this lesson obviously it was a little bit fast and loose and it will be a lot more structured on the market structured lesson on thursday hopefully you found this one insightful and i'm going to show you again this was a trade actually took with a live account all right so i'm going to log into my tdmr trade account and i'll show you a result of a trade i took yesterday i have not taken any live trades today again this is just the show real executions are being done i like to teach with a demo but just to answer the folks that are just really hardline critics or just want to know can i push the button push the button on ct all right so here is the business for uh last six days trading and again this account is just to show what i believe a student could do now right away look at this right here this is this is not a losing trade it looks like negative twenty seven hundred dollars and fifty five twenty seven fifty five what that is is an adjustment by the broker because at the time of settlement when i closed the trade it showed that i was up four thousand nine hundred twenty dollars and then because of their accounting they were just showing that they were reflecting a gain of seven thousand six hundred seventy five dollars which is not a actual realized result for me it was them doing their administrative side it's a broker thing trust me i cannot do anything to make that happen it's not me doing some funny money business okay anybody that trades with live funds they've probably seen this happen in their own account so over here you can see the executions yesterday at a scratch where i got in a little too early i was only ambitious and then the second one i wasn't sure if it was going to go higher or lower and just to appease my curiosity i threw a short end just to see what we get snapped against me a little bit not not much but still enough to get my attention and i knew what i was looking for so there's the short i just outlined in the previous portion of this video wrote all that down held for the gap opening after reopen at six o'clock and there is the close of the trade right there nice little dandy four thousand nine hundred twenty dollars fixes the little pinch i took on the one trade earlier in the day and the one scratch was nothing it was covering costs okay and again there's the business there that's the entry and that's the exit and there's no commission costs on the one above that as you can see that was not a trade hope you found this insightful until talk to you on thursday be safe

all right folks welcome back I do hope everyone's doing well so we're looking at episode 12 this lesson and lecture is going to be on the topic of Market structure for precision technicians now admittedly going into this this is an advanced price action Theory you're going to have a lot of questions it's going to cause all kinds of anxiety for those that just feel like you have to learn it the first time you watch a video trust me you will not and you cannot learn this in one video okay this is actually going to be a lesson even my paid mentorship group has yet to see okay so I want to give you something that's fresh something that is deep that will allow you to go into your charts and start studying a little bit more well deeper than the normal higher high higher low idea that is made up of the retail view of Market structure all right here is the NASDAQ March contract for 2022 I already hear some of you already hissing and moaning the Forex traders in my group when are you ever going to talk about EUR dollar well let me remind you what I'm teaching Works in Forex okay it works in stocks it works in bonds it's up to you to decide what asset class you're going to work with Okay so I'm teaching price this is the asset class that's moving around nicely so I'm using it as a medium okay you could just as easily go into a Aussie dollar you know or pound Yen chart and you'll see these things happening as well okay trust me we'll get into Forex again okay I haven't abandoned forx I just want to mine this vein that's available in volatility right now with the index fatures all right so obviously we can see with the benefit of hindsight that the things we were looking for in price action has come to fruition we were looking for the Run below these lows in here we got that we were looking for a run and rebalance back up into this fair value Gap it did so handsomely broke lower overnight with all the wartime things that are going around the globe and you know what I'm referring to uh that caused a little bit of excitement on the downside and then we're back Above This short-term low I am not convinced at this point that we have made a low so that way we can put that the bed right now I'm not in the business of picking tops and bottoms so if you feel like you're going to go out there and do that just letting you know that I teach my PID group not to do that and I don't go out there actively trying to do that either but we're going to go into a deep dive of Market structure inside this area now before I do this I want you to understand this part this is the part that seems boring this is the part that gets the most complaints from those individuals that will never ever do well or succeed in this because they want five minute Trainers for something that's extremely Technical and you just can't strip it down to very easy ideas Okay so it's going to take a little bit of study thinking and homework of you going through old price data and you'll start seeing these things but I promise you this video will cause a light bulb movement for you and you'll start to see things that are in the charts all the time but you are not aware of it and it'll also allow you to go back into Old moves and see that this is in fact very true and you can use it to confirm or negate a price move I get a lot of questions through trading view people posting hey you can you answer this for me can you answer that for me I don't make it a business of doing that because I don't have a lot of time for it but I use those questions in these talking points in my lectures not only in this mentorship but in my private group so the questions I get a lot is how do I know if I'm going to sell above an old high how do I know it's not going to keep going higher well that's the underlying Market structure and the trust in the factors that I'm going to kind of like teach you tonight me teaching it to you is not going to transpose my trust that has to be developed in your learning curve it's going to take time how long is it going to take I don't know all of you are going to do it differently but you're going to arrive right on time exactly when you should that's when you're going to get it all okay and it's a matter of how much time and effort you put into studying it because these candlesticks you can make them say anything you want you beat on them and they'll submit to anything but you want to know what they're likely to be hinting at and I'm going to give you those Clues tonight but in here we're going to take a deep dive into that price action right there all right so we are looking inside that fair value gap on the daily chart this was the high end of that fair value Gap and this was the low end of that fair value Gap the time frame on this chart as you can see here 1 hour and I've outlined Market structure in the idea of long-term High long-term low short-term High short-term low and in between those two swing points there's an intermediate term High and an intermediate term low when we look at Price we're not looking for just the simple higher high higher low therefore it's a bullish Market or uptrend that that's not what I'm looking at I'm looking at does the market have a reason to go up for buy side liquidity or buy stopped or is it likely go up to rebalance an imbalance which is like a fair value G or is it likely to go lower to sweep out short-term lows for sell side liquidity or sell stops or is it likely to go down to rebalance and old inbalance or a fair value G below market price that is the number one question that I have before I sit down in front of my charts that's what I'm looking for what is the current market narrative what is it likely to be doing right now I don't care about patterns in price action I don't care about anything harmonic I'm not looking for any kind of Elliot waves I'm not looking for any kind of ratio idea I'm not looking for anything that you can attribute to a retail mindset nothing except for those two questions is it likely to go up for stops or go down for stops or is it going to go higher to rebalance or lower to rebalance balance now how do I arrive at that idea is is it going to go higher is it going to go lower because that kind of like leans on that question I told you many times if there's one question I get asked the most it's teach me bias in other words you want to know where's the market going next and that's good that's the next draw on liquidity but the daily range will not always submit to that bullish or bearish right from the opening go higher or rate from the opening go lower sometimes you'll have consolidation Inay and you may have been trying to take a trade that was based on an idea that you came to that would be bullish and maybe it did give you an opportunity to be in a trade that was profitable for a period of time but you held on to it thinking the daily range was going to keep on going higher and it turned on you these ideas I'm going to teach you in this lecture here will help you identify the likelihood that your idea is probably been proven inaccurate but you have to be receptive to the clues that price has given you that's the number one reason why I abandoned indicators and if you have anything on the charts that cover up candles or Draw your attention to something that you're putting on the chart and I call that you know factiously lipstick okay that's what this chart is showing here it's this lipstick it's me communicating how I am internalizing this price structure this fractal and price I'm looking at it with this idea now I'm looking at it in a matter of seconds I come to this conclusion I'm looking at the highs and I'm looking at the relationships between each swing High each swing low and I'm coming to a conclusion studying one swing at a time and I'm going to come up with the idea that it's likely to go lower because that daily chart we I called it in front of all of you I outlined it told you where it was going to go so that way we understand one I'm teaching something that I already proved before the fact so it's not like me coming back to this area here because if you haven't watched the videos proba let say you just found this YouTube channel and you're watching this one it sounds like the typical guy that comes on YouTube and says here's something that happened you know and I can sound and look and appear smart because it's already happened and I have no real risk in being wrong I told you it was going to go lower from here and it did now I'm going to take you inside that price section and outline what it is that I look for what it is that I looked for at the time and how I felt confident it was going to go lower okay so right away we know that price has traded up to the high end of that fair value Gap and again this level here is that daily chart let me go back up one chart that's this level here okay it's on this candle that low and the low of the fair value G is this candle's High dropping down in to the hourly chart that's the high end of the fair value Gap this is the low end of the fair value Gap again on an hourly chart so that way we have our bearings so when the market traded up into and just above that fair value Gap high this red level here once it started to break down and go lower it traded back down into this candlestick's high so we're trading back inside this range and we're range bound since I am expecting the daily chart to be the parent of this price structure all minor lower time frame swings are going to be subordinate to it and what does that mean this now is a long-term High I do not expect this High to be broken to the upside should it be broken to the upside that means that my daily analysis expecting this level here to hold price and to be a factor in the algorithm repricing and going lower at a later time if it goes above that then I'm probably wrong in my analysis so therefore I demand more information by studying more price action and sitting on my hands or if I have a trade on it means that I have to admit that I'm wrong and the stop out that may occur is just me managing risk it's a losing transaction does not mean your model is flawed it does not mean that you're a failed Trader it just means that that transaction was not a profitable one and it's just a cost of doing business but as long as price remains below this High my idea is this is a long-term High because it's framed on what a higher time frame resistance level if we're want to talk in terms of retail idea so that way we can understand something in a simplistic manner but we'll build on the ideas that will help move you away from simple support resistance ideas so this long-term high should remain intact and no's price should not go higher than that we trade down to the discount level of the low end of that fair value Gap and it starts to find support rallies back up trades near the high but does not take that out very important once it starts to break down and consolidate in here retail ideas will see a lot of trust in the idea that's potentially a bull flag I love seeing those patterns because I like to fade them so that's a false bull flag and when we see price break down like this and then rally back up every single time this is important this is the part where you start writing down these details every single time price rebalances an imbalance like we have this candle's low this candle's High we have that one single candle passing down like that once that rebalances by going up here that swing high from this high this high and this High that's a swing high right there I immediately label that in my mind not on my chart because I don't want anything distracting me if I have these things written on my chart at the time it's going to be a distraction to me but the way I'm internalizing it and you'll see what I mean as I go through this lecture every rebalance of an old imbalance That Swing that's created at that moment I immediately label that in my mind as an intermediate term high or in this case as we came back down and filled in this by dropping down here that's an intermediate term low what does that mean what's the significance of that typically what you'll see is intermediate term low has a higher short-term low to the right of it and a higher short-term low to the left of it this immed term low forms by rebalancing but it has a higher short-term High here but then the market trades over here off of this short-term low it rallies up but it fails it fails in here we're going to anticipate that failure whereas if you're looking at this low high higher low failed higher high higher low so what's forming here a pennant or a triangle pattern right how do you know which side's going to break out that was one of the questions I had all the time as a developing student back in the 90s 1992 1993 I was buying every book and get my hands on and I got the book the John Murphy technical analysis of the financial markets book which is the retail Traders Bible okay that book is so useful in terms of just reading it and knowing what not to do because that's what the 90% crowd follows when they look at Price action still to this day because it's always regurgitated in some way shape or form someone's teaching that same idea uptrending trend lines which are so subjective how do you know what swing lad attach for a trend line there's lots of Swing lows in here how do you draw it it's all subjective so you have to have a way to reduce it down to I hate to say it like this but it really is no better way of saying it but you have to break it down into a science we don't do technical analysis we do technical science okay you have to be able to relate to certain things way out and measure what these factors are within price action which is not based on hypothetical guesswork or some kind of a harmonic animal pattern which to me makes no sense you have to look at the relationship to price action and the relationship of how it behaves what is it indicating what is it showing the market has traded higher then Consolidated we failed to go above this important high back here that's a long-term High then we have an interterm High why why is this a intermediate term High because we have a short-term High here and a short-term High here so between two short-term highs the highest high between those that's an inter term high but the main takeaway for your notes so far is anytime a imbalance like this big candle up is rebalanced that becomes an intermediate term low just as well on the opposite end this down move here that's a fair value Gap soon as it rebalances there that's what I classify as an iment term high now here's where we take a huge step forward classically defined by Larry Williams and you can see where I made a departure from his works okay it was very influential in the beginning of my development and it was a point of argument internally with me when I was watching him teach it on his VHS course the future millionaires confidential trading course that idea of his approach to Market structure he teaches a little bit of it in this book okay so it's long-term secrets to short-term trading by Larry Williams um there's not a lot of books I have over 2,000 some books and I can tell you literally there's a handful of books out of all my collection that are useful and I can't bring myself to throw them away way because number one I paid a lot of money for him and it's just Nostalgia you know me chasing all that stuff in books and it's just always the same stuff that never really works the ideas that he teaches in this book here they were taught in a early work by him in regards to Market structure how to internalize price structure how to look at Price not just from a higher high higher low because that's too myopic okay it's a Pursuit especially in this generation today it's a pursuit of Simplicity for the sake of Simplicity alone not for the sake of getting to the truth or the heart of the matter and that's what makes me a stumbling block for many of you that are younger because you want right now instant gratification you want instant reward for the minial time that you invest when it's surprising to learn that you're going to take a lot more time than you first thought it was going to take to learn how to do this exceptionally well but for an additional view on how I built this understanding in price action it originally came from his idea of Market structure but if you study what I'm going to show you in this video lecture here my paid group has never seen this before and you're seeing it for the first time okay so when you hear people talk about Market structure and they're looking for a higher high higher high higher high and having successive lower lows behind them and then you have a failed higher high and then it breaks the swing low right before that failed higher high they look at that as a change in Trend uh not all the time many times that's a good buying opportunity for me because really that's just coming back down to a deep discount and I'm going to buy those and continue higher so it's a little tricky if you don't understand the higher time frame which is what these red levels are that's higher time frame the erarchy in parent to child price swings okay so that way the subordination that the smaller time frame price swings adhere to from the higher time frame is directly linked to the order flow on those higher time frame charts so in other words what am I saying the daily chart has the bulk of the volume that's coming into that Marketplace there isn't a lot of volume coming in on a one minute chart that's not to change the importance or reduce the importance rather of an of a one minute chart within the proper context and Market structure that's underway so you can use a one minute chart to navigate because as a smaller retail Trader which is who we all are but we don't trade with retail logic there's a there's a separation from what we're trying to do in price versus the collective out there that learns from books and things like that now that may sound like an Octor because I'm pointing to a book right here on the screen but the ideas that he teaches early in this book about Market structure I think is the whole well the only I found useful in that book I have a lot of respect for this man but out of that entire book his discussions about Market structure that's the only thing I find that is useful from that book so if you're reading anything else in that book you know great if you like it but my only addition to this for more research for more of a foundational idea where I got this from um you're going to hear people say um he teaches Larry Williams Market structure no I don't the ideas that came early on in my learning came from this man's interpretation of Market structure but I want to take you into the chart now and show you what he's not teaching in that book what he hasn't taught in any of his works and it gets a little bit closer to the heart of the matter and you'll find it it's it's really interesting so if we have a imbalance that's rebalanced and we have an intermediate term High shouldn't an intermediate term High have a lower short-term High to the right of it and a lower short-term High to the left of it yes Mr Williams says so in his book also would I discovered in my own study no one taught this to me okay I kind of pioneered this idea see a lot of these Instagram guys after saying they p neared something in the last two years of trading the idea of a intermediate term High not being higher than the short-term High to the left of it or the short-term High to the right of it in other words it's going lower this an ideal scenario should be this high should be above both short-term Highs but it's not it's not so what what is it doing it's only rebalancing this and where is it likely to go well if you're thinking in terms of a pennant or triangle pattern it's indicating to me soon as this candle starts to go up like this this candle and this candle why not this candle too well this candle only has this low here this candle is an up close but this starts the last two up closed candles right before this move down this is important because we're going to look inside this shaded area and how we can use highly precise ideas within this order block I'm anticipating this run up with these candles forming an order block where everyone else is teaching the idea of the last up Clos candle before the down move that is not my order block that is not my order block so you need to stop teaching that because it's not accurate call it something else but don't call it order block this movement here these two green candles that are going up I'm watching these as they form live with the expectation because this imbalance has been rebalanced here this swing high is an the intermediate term High I do not I do not expect this High to be taken out so I'm already forecasting and anticipating a failed price swing in here every time this green candles are forming I'm looking at that as a bearish order block so from the beginning at that candles low I'm looking in time on Lower time frame charts lower than what well this is a 1 hour chart so what's the time frame below that I dropped to a 50-minute time frame now before I get any further just know that the range between this long-term high and this long-term low that range is going to be used for targeting purposes and I'll get into that in a moment but these up closed candles from the hourly perspective that's the range for my hourly order block inside that range I can be hunting fair value gaps light bulb I don't need to see the market trade down below the last highest up closed candle I don't need that because I understand what I'm looking for inside Market structure actual Market structure not just higher high higher low I'm looking at the underpinnings of the marketplace and I'm examining what is it doing High to high low to low within a higher time frame premise remember the premise was we were going to go up to this upper level level here rebalance and then eventually trade lower down below sell side liquidity in this fractal I'm using this one here just to illustrate the idea so in other words up here it's going to make a short pattern something bearish to get short on then work towards going down to that low now clearly you can see it here does so nicely but I want to take you into this price action right here before I zoom in look closely what do you see pause the video I'm not ping at the do ICT and you can't make me all right right in here you can see a small little imbalance this one single candle like that right there that's the same thing that was occurring in this move here on the hourly chart that gets rebalanced there here we have a small version of it that is a fractal that's something that repeats on a smaller or higher time frame that's similar in its formation it won't be identical but it's closely related to the general idea if it trades back to this candle High don't worry I'll zoom in in a moment that's your entry right there that's aggressive and I don't have a problem being aggressive if I know what I'm looking for but there's also an imbalance in here and it rebalances that right there see that now once we establish the market structure on that hourly chart I'm not going down into the lower time frames below it and marking out all the swing highs and swing lows either that that's Overkill I just need to know what I'm looking for on the time frame I'm trading on the logic is based on that daily chart that it's going up into this imbalance to go lower the hourly chart frames my trade it gives me what I'm looking for to start hunting entry techniques now the 15-minute time frame that's the Bell weather this is where it's going to give me the actual get in get out but I might not like the risk parameters that's required on this time frame so I can go down into lower time frames should price go lower and break lower I'm looking at that short-term low here and that INR term low there if we have a short-term low taken out and an intermediate term low taken out or just an intermediate term low taken out then we can go back to the previous long-term High long-term low now a long-term High long-term low is generally going to be linked to a higher time frame daily chart that might be a price range it might be a high to a short-term low in this case I'm framing the idea and logic around that fair value Gap that I outlined in front of all of you saying it's likely go up there rebounce and then go lower and take out that old daily low there's lots of ways you can frame your trade but you have to have something directly linked to that daily chart because the daily chart that's exactly what institutions are working off of that's exactly what banks are working off of that's where the money is that's where your bias is going to be determined that's going to be what makes or breaks your Trend continuation that daily chart so the majority of your time in study should be on determining where that daily chart's going over the next day or two or a week but you try not to forecast longer than a week not that you can't I'm not suggesting that anyone can't do that I'm just saying if as a developing student you want to keep your perspective limited to a 5-day time Horizon and don't be upset if you don't have the entire weekly range forecasted correctly that's not important right now you're growing you're trying to learn how to do this and it's highly technical no one gets it overnight it took me six years so but it pays off if you stick with it so if we have a break below and any return low then we have what a significant break in Market structure this is something that's more significant just simply than going into a chart saying okay well it took out a short-term low there it is uh-uh see how much more detailed this is what this tells me is then I can start using this range high and low and start getting projections down I can get a measurement of measuring this High to this low and start replicating that going down and it'll give me price targets they're generic price targets if you don't want to use that targeting method this long-term low to interterm high if price breaks below here as it does here you can simply take your Fibonacci anchor it to the highest high down to the lowest low and this is what you would get here why am I using that why am I not using this here to here because this returned back up this is where all of this move starts right there this is just the beginning of the the framework this is where the swing begins on the decline follow what I'm saying I'll say it again this high and this low that's your framework the retracement that fails that starts the decline begins here at that intermate term high so if you anchor your FIB to the interm term High down to that low which is a long-term low the projection is -1 1/2 standard deviation and there's your low how much lower than this can it go that's one way of determining it now I know what you're asking what is your FIB settings ICT there's my FIB settings okay I don't toggle everything because I don't need all the lines but I'm looking at measurements like this with logic behind it it's not just me randomly going in there because I get a lot of qu when I was on baby Pips I got lots of emails all the time and people would post in the form why are you anchoring your FIB to That Swing high and not in that swing high and not this swing high this is what I never taught this is what I'm showing you today this is Advanced Market structure this is not something you're going to find in books Mr Williams I'm sure doesn't even know it like this he's rather simplistic in the way he does things that's the only thing I've really gleaned from him he's he's a legend don't get me wrong but he does things rather simplistic but but because of my background is computer programming and computer science and I have obsessive compulsive disorder I need to know why things do what they do and I need to know everything now I don't know everything but my pursuit of knowing everything led me to look at markets like this and internalize how what the algorithms are doing because there has to be a rhyme and reason right like to suggest the idea that these markets are operating under an algorithm and they're going up and down based on and AI artificial intelligence is controlling this it's not your buying and selling pressure I've said this many times before but if that is true and let's suspend your disbelief if you don't believe there's an algorithm just for the sake of this conversation let's just say for a moment that you do subscribe to the idea if there's an algorithm that means it must follow some form of logic and how does it reference how far to go up and how far to go down it cannot see your stop it doesn't see Michael stop it doesn't see Renee stop it doesn't see Juan stop it doesn't see Brian Larry that's outside of its capability but it knows where people will have their stops based on these ideas is short-term High short-term low interterm high interterm low long-term low long-term high and where the imbalances are now I already know right now at this moment right now your heads are spinning you're probably sitting here looking at man this is crazy how did he come up with this and how the hell am I going to use it exactly you're going to take time learning this line upon line precept upon precept here a little there a little it takes time to do this okay but I got requested to teach Market structure and this is my interpretation of Market structure because I'm leaning on algorithmic principles that are in the marketplace that can't be taught to you but I'm creating a language so that way you can see it visually in your chart and you can measure and reference certain things not exactly like the gthm does but very very close to what it's doing which in my mind doesn't really step on anybody's toes now does it so if we're looking at this little shaded area here I want to zoom in now and get down to the heart ofest teaching this is the same 15-minute time frame and just zoomed in a little bit more this is an aggressive entry for going short now that hourly chart was showing those two candles going up in the 15minute time frame it's obviously more cand so in this up close candle series of 1 2 3 4 five candles in that range if I get a fair value gy form with a breakdown like this notice I don't need a swing low broken notice that on the model I'm teaching you you have to look for what the short-term low being broken that's your Market structure shift then you see price go up into that imbalance and then you can go short or vice versa when you're going bullish if you understand Market structure with this perception looking at it from a higher time frame and anticipating a breakdown but then starting to classify each imbalance and swing high and swing low inate term highs and lows are formed at the rebalancing of an imbalance everything I already said in the video okay I'm just reiterating if the intermedi term high is not higher than two short-term highs that is telling you that the market is very weak and the algorithm is tipping its hand to those people that are looking at it like this who would be looking at like this smart Money traders someone that's not looking at a chart with harmonic ideas nothing Elliot wave they don't even look at support and resistance that's not a factor that's not a factor at all when Bank Traders sit down they're not looking at support and resistance they care less about a trend line they don't care about moving averages crossing over none of that stuff they're looking at imbalance rebalance and liquidity that is it that's it that's all they're doing now framing that within the context of Forex they would be utilizing the fundamental idea of interest rate differentials which I'll talk a little bit about not in this lesson but I said we go into Forex but right now we're teaching price through this medium and index Futures but this stuff works in Forex period okay there's no reason to question whether if it's just only going to work in this it works in all markets this is your aggressive entry you don't need a swing low being broken because you have the idea based on Market structure suggesting that this is exceedingly weak if it's exceedingly weak that means the next short-term High how do I know it's going to be a short-term High I don't know because I'm studying the up closed candles because that's going to be an order block later on now everybody else knows how to look at these candles after it goes below it and comes back up and bumps the bottom of that right there so the bottom of that rectangle that's the classic ICT bearish order block the advanced interpretation of an order block would be using Market structure like this which is unconventional but you start seeing the imbalances inside the order block when you're already expecting it to sell off see this interent term High I already know that this rebalance here classifies this in my mind as an interent term high that means it should not trade above that high just like this short-term high and this short-term High did not trade above this interent term High why is this an interent term High when it didn't even rebalance anything didn't think I'd get to that question did you he's reading my mind here's a long longterm High here's a swing High over here a swing High over here see that long-term high right intermed term High short-term High short-term high or if you want to use this one I'm using this one not classifying this one because this is energetic it moves lower you could have easily had a short-term High marker there but I'm using this one because it has that run lower to rebalance the IM term High has a lower short-term High to the left of it and a lower short-term High to the right of it so intermediate term highs there's two classifications it is a short-term High that has a lower short-term High to the left of it and a lower short-term High to the right of it or and this is the main one here it trades back up to rebalance and imbalance that immediately becomes an interm term high now the usefulness of that is if we're bearish and it rebalances like this the next shortterm high should be lower than that intermed term high if it trades higher than that then your trade ideas probably flawed Don't force that trade again wait for Market structure to get back in sync with what you're expecting something bearish that's how you keep from blowing your account or forcing your will in the marketplace now let's go back into the order block inside these candles as it's going up I'm looking at lower time frame TR and this is a 15-minute time frame we see it break down it doesn't take any short-term low out but it's inside these up Clos candles which is an hourly order block of two candles each the imbalance trades up into that's your aggressive sell your stock could be right above that High classic lowrisk High confirmation short entry is the classic return back to an order block after a trade down below it here's your little Gap here trade into it there's your short where's your stop Above This candle's High there you go now you can go down into the charts deeper with your 5 4 3 2 and one narrowing down to a smallest time frame you can see see that the last two candles here right for the turn inside the order block the order block is the Shaded pink box but these last two candles here with The Gap that low is exactly to the quarter point as that candle's high right there don't take my word for it go into your charts and you'll see that is exactly the perfect delivery to that candle's low what's so why am I pointing to that candle because the order block is one consecutive series of up closed candles it's not the last candle before the down move you can tell where these folks learned what lessons I taught from and where they pared from but order block theory is much more than just simply the last up close candle before down move or the last down closed candle before the up move that's not it this is it you have the up closed candles together here with the imbalance inside of a larger order block within the bearish market structure because we have an inant term High here then this run up is going to fail to go back Above This high now I know some of you are like this is too much they there's no how am I going to be able to go into the chart and be able to do this you're not going to right away but you need to go back to your data and your charts and start breaking them down and classifying them like this you have the benefit of hindsight that's how I began to trust it because I would go through old data and start breaking them down and looking for these things right here that's how I bridged what I learned about how the algorithm prices and books price and then I made a language within price charts that communicates very closely what it's doing this is the language that I created for all of you to understand what it is I'm trying to interpret to you that have never seen this before the imbalance here it goes over a little bit that's okay but inside this range in here more specifically the order block the hourly right here that's where your fill would be or aiming with your limit order and the heat on the trade would be on this candle's movement there but your stock would be above here but you're aiming for a very large downside objective so the risk from entering here at the bottom of the hourly bearish order block which is again represented by the bottom of that rectangle here you're entering there the Heat or the draw down in the trade is limited to just that candle but your stop has to be here and you're expanding lower for a Target that's many times over what your risk is dropping down to a 4-minute chart here's that same order block from the 5 minute perspective it's a little skewed now because we're looking at four minutes each candle's four minutes in duration Market trades up into that hits it perfectly not that it's link anything on the 4-minute chart but it's lengthed again to that 5minute chart hits it right there beautifully trades lower comes right back up trades into the top end that fair value gap on the higher time frame before we started dropping down we have a little bit of movement above it and that's okay because this Market is very volatile right now you can't demand the markets to always deliver with this level of precision sometimes you get this little coloring outside the lines and that's okay that's a matter of experience and time studying it and doing it you anticipate a certain measure of imperfection and still submitting yourself to the idea that just because it went above that level doesn't mean it broke it and it's going to keep going higher it's likely to do that and if it does don't freak out then the market trades lower and reaches where there's targets now what I want you to think about is when you see these patterns for entry now ton I taught you how to look at Market structure from an advanced perspective I already know some of you are going to be very confused by this lesson and I understand your confusion but that confusion is reduced by you going in and looking at Price data and start studying it and looking at it the idea is this when you see an imbalance get rebalanced the high formed as it rebalances that high should not be violated by Price going higher than that if you're bearish if you blend that with institutional order flow what is institutional order flow when you're bearish all of your up closed candles should keep price from going higher than them what does that mean we have an imbalance here the market trades up into the bullish candles that were on the five minute chart we're on a 4minute chart that's that red level here let me go back up to say you know that's this one here this is a down close candle right there these are the last two up close candles before the displacement here and then balance Market trades back up into that right there there's your bearish order Block it's aggressive but if you know what you're looking for that's very very fun to do that on the 4-minute chart there's that same return back to that 5-minute beish order block Watch What Happens Market breaks lower so we have up close candle and up closed candles the market trades higher yes but does it overtake this up Clos candle no it just trades back up into it a little bit but doesn't go above it wow that's important because if it doesn't overtake these up closed candles here or here it doesn't even need to get to these because it hasn't even overcome this one so it acts as real resistance that's institutional orderflow your Market when it breaks again from the consolidation in here all of these up closed candles never get reached into again here at all but notice what we got over here we have up closed candles the market leaves it then it comes right back up does it overtake these up Clos candles no so it's going to remain heavy so in short I've taught you tonight to look at the markets from a market structure perspective by breaking down the price swings labeling them specifically in inbalance that's rebalanced that intermediate term high or low should not be violated that's a key high or a key low that sets the stage for a market move at that should unfold and deliver to a higher time frame objective in this case as we outlined in the beginning I showed you last week in the week before that that we were looking for weakness in NASDAQ to take out its daily low if you combine that logic with Market structure and the imbalance rebalance becomes intermediate term highs and lows those key highs and lows with them not being violated if they are violated that means your idea is wrong and you cancel the idea and you don't try to go in and force it again and overtrade and blow your account while the market is moving in your favor you're going to continue to trust that move and hold on to your trade because if you're bearish up Clos candles should keep price below it or them if it's multiple up closed candles they're speed bumps they may come back up and touch them and act as a what bearish order block but you do not want to see them traded above if you're bearish and vice versa if you're bullish when price is moving higher generally the candles will be predominantly Green in my case because I'm looking at Green candles when it's going higher whatever your candle color is on your platform predominantly there's going to be more up closed candles when it's bullish but down closed candles should support price if it trades back down to them them it's going to act as a support structure for an order block so I've given you two mean components to Market structure and institutional order flow how to know when the move is still good and not be afraid and how do you know when the move is likely to be dynamic and how do you know when the idea is probably flawed and your interpretation or your analysis is wrong if that intermediate term high or low is broken after your trade idea becomes possible if that in term high is broken and you're bearish then you got to move through the sidelines and don't go in again wait for more setups in the future it may be in the same trading session or it may be in the same trading day or it may require you to trade in the following week you just can't force it I taught you institutional order flow which is again I've already mentioned this in the previous lessons where we we're bullish and we're expecting a price swing higher generally there is not a lot of down Clos candles in that price swing higher but those down closed candles should support price should it trade back down into them and not see them overlapped in other words going down below it if it does it's only permissible if there's a short-term low in close proximity to it and it's then lik like just go down and take out some sell stops if it's bullish and then reaccumulate and go higher if there is no swing low there would be no swing low with cell side below it so there's nothing to concern yourself with just look for down Clos candles to support price higher so in other words price swings that are bullish down closed candles are your support in price swings that are bearish up Clos candles are your resistance now if you blend these ideas together you get a perspective on price that cannot be gleaned from other teachers Educators Traders authors gurus or whatever but these are my responses to folks that ask me how do I know what swing high and what swing low to use as you can see it's not a question that I can go in and say in one simple statement this is what I'm doing it takes takes deeper thought it takes study and it has to require supportive lessons that there's still going to be needed for the majority of you that are sitting here listening to me and you're saying okay I can see what you're saying I can see it but there's no way I would have came to that conclusion on my own nobody would expect you to you're too new you haven't been doing it enough and frankly I've never taught this before this is what I've kept close to my V but I want to give and I want to share but you're not going to understand this in one lesson but because I am trading and I'm sharing and I'm teaching I will show you more examples that way you can see the logic behind it but I want you to go back to your charts and look at every time the market rebalances classify that as an interterm high or interent term low if it's you know with a rebound that's been moving higher than went down balance that and then watch how prices stay away from violating it and if you can frame a context around a price swing that's linked to a higher time frame chart like the daily then you have a wonderful model that has higher time frame order flow behind it that is Paramount for your trade to work if you can't see it working or following suit to what the daily chart's likely to do or in layman's terms if you're trading against what that daily time frame or daily chart is likely to be doing you are absolutely asking for failure you're asking for it you're begging for it that's not to say that you can't go long when the daily chart's going lower but why would you want to why would you want to swim against the tide why would you want to be the salmon the salmon that fights its way up against the current just to get to the top of the river spawns and then dies you got there but failed in the end you want to be working with the tide you want to be moving with the EB and flow of these markets on a high time frame because that daily chart if you understand that daily chart let's go back up to it if you're doing all of your analysis and linking your trade ideas based on the logic behind this time frame here you're going to avoid a lot of losing trades now you're going to lose you're going to have losing trades I have losing trades but you're going to avoid the silly mistakes that the majority of retail Traders make you're not going to to see why on a 15-minute time frame or a 5-minute chart why it's not turning around and reversing intraday when it feels like it might be doing so because you'll have these small little you know quick Dynamic little Pops in the direction it's counter with the daily chart suggesting those are just little traps they're little moves that get people caught up in oh it's going to go reverse let me get and Chase that and then it just creates another selling opportunity when the daily chart is like to continue going lower so you have to submit yourself to what this daily chart is doing what's it reaching for and when it reaches it stop get a lay of the land again check your barings which is what I'm going to close this video with now we were up here we rebalanced I said all of this here is just normal for us to anticipate a run down below here this is is this rebalancing for another leg lower to go down here so we have had that in price it's delivered but now we're back above that low so what does that mean for us well on the daily chart it's been bearish but we're back Above This Old low that is in my mind do nothing we're neutral right now why why would you be neutral can you still be bearish yes can you be bullish if you want to go against the trend of the daily time frame well it just brings with it a greater measure of risk now there's going to be times where you can go back in the charts and say but yeah look at this time anybody can do that I'm looking at the hard right Edge right now and my paid mentorship group is hearing this video Just Like You Are I Am neutral right now I am not taking any trades there's a lot of things going on globally there's a lot of confusion right now money is Running Scared in the marketplace and I don't see where we're going next with a great deal of certainty so what did I just say to you publicly I don't know what are you say ICT just said he don't know something he doesn't know what the Market's going to do right right now I don't know so if I don't know and if I can't classify it based on the things I'm looking for in price yes it could possibly go a little bit higher this could be the low it could be some kind of reversal they could you stop doing what you're doing over there in Europe and in Ukraine and everything becomes happy and nothing happens bad again for a couple months and the markets go higher I don't see that right now I don't know if it's is going to continue going lower where it's at right now neutral because I can't justify it one-sidedness okay this is how I teach my my pay group the things I teach them if you can't go into your charts and line up an idea that's bullish and have no way to frame it on a bearish stance in other words if you can very easily communicate it in your analysis that it's likely to go higher but it's a real hard stretch to sell it for a bearish idea that's high probability if you can frame it bearish but have a hard time defining it in a bullish perspective that's high probability now how many trades have you taken in your time as a Trader where it could go either way but what the hell I got time I'm in front of the charts let me just get here see what happens and you enter a market and then you lose what happens after that you have a lot of regret and you know what you're thinking I don't even know why I did that that was dumb why' I get into the marketplace everyone's done that everyone has done that and I have blown accounts doing that 1990s I was Reckless did whatever I wanted to do and none of it was really hinged on Sound Logic it was me discovering risk because I didn't respect it when I first went into it but I found out real hard that it hurts and you don't want to go through that so this brings this lesson to conclusion tonight and I am absolutely certain that you have a Litany of questions and concerns and confusions all of those things get answered over time spending time with me looking at examples and you'll see it over time it cannot be understood in one lesson it absolutely cannot happen and I know some of you young guys are going to want to post in the comment section I understand exactly what you said I've seen this 15 times before don't I I don't look at those messages and think to myself wow and I'm not going to let that message be posted to the video comment section I'm not looking for you know messages that fluff me up I'm just looking for ones that I like okay and if it's something that I think that would be been official to the community I'll use it but if it's something I just thought it was funny or useful that's the one I like out of all the comments it doesn't mean that all the comments that were not selected were useless or uh less important because some of them are questions I am using your questions in the way I'm teaching so that way I'm covering a lot of the bases that you guys are saying I'm stuck with understanding this but just know that there's a lot of the questions that you're asking that will be answered in the normal progression through the lessons I have planned for you it may not feel like it it may feel like you're being ignored or that I don't care about your question or I'm somehow avoiding it because I don't have an answer I have answers okay I have answers to the questions you have not had aise in your thoughts yet but you just got to relax and go through the natural progression of it this is very technical stuff folks very very technical you don't need to be this technical but I was asked to teach Market structure and there's a lot of folks out there especially on YouTube that pretend to know about Market structure but they have no real idea what they're doing the only thing they're explaining is what's already happened in the price charts I'm showing you something in Greater detail what I outline to every one of you in this YouTube channel everyone in this YouTube channel watched me outline this market right here and it moved 14,500 points based on that logic that's a lot that's a very significant price move and it behaved exactly how I'm teaching it to you that should be reassuring number one but also it should be intriguing because if I'm able to sit down with you and this was not a CH how many times have I put out suggest sus either in the comment section of my community tab or in video how many times have I said something and it didn't come to pass they're not cherry-picked I'm showing you things that are based on the logic that I'm teaching you okay so it removes the necessity for Blind Faith okay don't believe me because I'm ICT believe what I'm teaching you and that you're seeing in the charts yourself when you're back testing and watching it it live that's where the proof is discovered cuz I can do this every single day and there still going to be people that's going to doubt and the folks that are convinced already they don't need any more Assurance they just want to learn and that's what I'm doing I'm teaching you I'm teaching you exactly what's going on on that hard right edge of that chart and right now at this moment I'm teaching you a greater lesson when not to do something you may have an account open you may have time to be in front of your charts you may have an idea some kind of inkling that you think the Market's going to do this or that I'm telling you personally I am not touching this at all I'm not trading Forex I'm not trading Futures I'm not trading crypto I've never traded crypto and I'm not touching stocks I'm not touching bonds I'm not trading anything right now I'm going to let the rest of February transpire without me engaging it's done exactly what I outlined for all of you it was a nice price move it was logical it was precise it delivered exactly as I outlined beforehand and tonight I taught you the internals behind that in a very structured detailed way your infancy as a student under me is going to be an impediment to you understanding everything and even my paid mentorship group are probably scratching their heads tonight too because there's gaps in their understanding because I just literally introduced this for the first time they have they don't have this in any of the lessons they had none of them no one has seen me teach this it's the first time I'm unveiling what it is when I look at Market structure what is it I'm doing how am I framing things I'm using a top down approach from the daily down to the lower time frames but the time frame I'm framing the setup on which was the hourly chart using higher time frame logic and the order flow in other words I'm bearish because that daily chart suggest that it's going to go down below here when it was up here this went down too quick and why do the market even creating a fair value got why does the market go up here because this Market dropped one-sided right here it just went down there wasn't a lot of give and take back and forth It's one candle that went down like that because it's one candle it's one day one interval it's going to have the likelihood not it must always not that it's going to do it immediately but the expectation is it's likely to go back back up into this area here with an up candle balancing out the movement lower it's going to go back up to offer buyers an opportunity to buy at those prices it matters not if those buyers are correct in their assumptions about this Marketplace the algorithm is allowing efficiency for Price delivery and in layman's terms it means it went down to too quick it wasn't offering enough time for anyone that wants to buy it so it goes back up once it does that it rebalances right there spends a little bit of time and then displacement again and then right to where we outlining it the question I want to leave you with is this why does it respect the levels I'm teaching here in the logic from imbalance to liquidity if everything is based on trend lines moving averages harmonic patterns Fibonacci this Elliot wave that if those things were real and they had factors that really made price go higher or lower answer this for me this is the riddle you need to figure out okay how does the market know which discipline it's going to f follow any given day is it going to follow harmonic animal patterns or is it going to follow Elliot wave or is it going to use supply and demand or is it going to use volume profile is going to use white cof is it going to use the patterns that's found on range bars is it going to use what's in ichimoku you getting the point it all of those disciplines do not agree all of them they're at odds with one another one discipline's going to say wait for this one discipline's going to say wait for that so how is it that the market determines which discipline it's going to use for that given time period or that day that's nonsense that's you being religious any of you that subscribed to those ideas and I did you are under a faith-based premise that what you're learning should work when it's not based on any of those things the Market's only book and print these candles based on two principles liquidity going above old highs for buy stops going below old lows for sell stops or rebalancing or creating imbalance so it's imbalance rebalance run for liquidity that's it it does not do anything else the algorithm is not looking at harmonic patterns it's not thinking well you know I haven't used a bat pattern in a while so let's drive them batty it's not thinking I want to scare the living hell out of them and create a shark pattern it's silly it is silly and I know some of you trade like this okay and I'm not trying to make fun of you I'm just asking you to be highly critical about a perception of what it is that we as Traders do and how much a fallacy it is when you strip all that stuff away and it sounds like I'm biased because this is what I'm teaching you but noce what I'm doing I gave up millions of dollars a year to come out here and teach for free I could still be making millions there's many of you are still asking can I just join on your page no you can't join be happy I'm teaching I'm teaching mentorship right here come on what's in it for me I'm already rich I already know how to trade a lot of people like what I do I don't need to be doing this I just enjoy it but why is the market doing what I teach so precisely so consistently maybe it's because this is the market maybe it's because this is the algorithm I'll leave that with you to decide enjoy your weekend be safe and I'll talk to base with you on Tuesday

all right folks welcome back this is an extra lesson but we'll call it episode 13 nonetheless so last night i gave a lesson on market structure for precision technicians and advanced price action theory in action is going to be this lesson here so it's one thing to talk about it and provide the basis as to what i'm doing when i'm doing these executions when i'm running these demo accounts up really fast you know what am i doing how am i doing it i got a lot of questions as to how i ran the ten thousand dollar account up to which was at 256 000 this morning but it quickly got to a point where it no longer can be appreciated from students perspective it's too fast of growth and the acceleration just makes it well you have new you have no connection to it if you don't know how to do this and you're new you start seeing velocity in equity increasing even though it's a demo it does not matter the same principles are applied whether you're trading with a live account or if you're trading with a demo account and you're learning and i want to take you into what it is i do and how i'm able to run the equity up quick what is the mindset behind what is i'm doing but before i get into it let me remind you what i stated last night in the video because of the heightened volatility because of the uncertainty and the likelihood of price action moves that would be unexpected even for me because it's already delivered what i wanted to see happen anyway and i'm technically bearish on equities i don't feel confident or willing to risk after being profitable in live trading going short this market making my february gain i don't want to go in and risk that because it's already arrived down below these lows so there's an objective i look for for the week there's an objective i try to aim for for the day and there's something i'm aiming for for a goal for the month so truth be told the account that i'm showing with td ameritrade i'm trying to illustrate in my best ability to pantomime how it would likely be for a new student if they were to try to do live trading with a model and aiming for 20 per month now some of you are going to think well 20 isn't a lot of money you know it's not a lot of money well 20 isn't money okay it's a percentage so i don't care if you start with one dollar if you make 20 consistently the compounding effects of that is astonishing now is it my belief that my students can consistently hit 20 every single month i would never go out on a limb and say that i might not hit 20 one of the months but that is a goal that i'm aiming for and if you're a new developing student they have worked very hard to find and refine your own model with the things i'm teaching and you have a trading plan that is well documented you know what it is you're doing when you're not going to do something you have a complete understanding of what it is that's going to allow you to engage or not engage in price then how to manage that risk all those factors involved and you've been consistent with a demo account for six months then and only then would i not necessarily that you need to do this but i would then only at that time consider maybe going into life fun trading but i don't ever tell my students i never answer an email when they say do you think i'm really going to lie i don't answer those questions i say i don't know you tell me or generally i ignore those emails because there is never going to be a record of me saying i think you're ready to go into life on trading and then when they blow their account who are they going to blame naturally the human is going to say well it wasn't my fault there was a guy that told me i should do it he told me to jump off the bridge so i never put myself in that situation okay and i don't think any mentor or educator worth their salt would ever tell you to go out and risk life money because experience has taught me that i got into live trading way too fast way way too fast in 1992 that was the worst thing i could have done for my development was rush to get into real money trading and i had no idea what i was doing i tricked myself into believing it was so easy reading one book no real back testing whatsoever and i was like well you know i can see this one two three top and one two three bottom idea you can see it yeah i saw it one two three i was gone in my first trade 50 history goodbye close the account send me my money i was afraid but when we understand what it is we're trying to do obviously you it comes with a great deal of nervousness and anxiety because you have not put the time into back testing and then forward testing it with a demo account so if you feel this tug of war this butterfly feeling in your stomach where you just you can't relax and you're engaging in the marketplace you're not ready that's the bottom line you're not ready you have to desensitize yourself with the results not being a factor if you lose it doesn't make a difference to you you're indifferent to it and it doesn't seem possible that you could be indifferent to losing money but a student that has a solid price action model a trade plan that's well documented they know what they're going to do why they're doing it what they're waiting for what will cause them to push the button to get in where their stop loss is going to be how much they're going to risk what they're going to aim for where their partials are going to be if they're going to take partials at all you have to know those things in advance you can't determine them once you enter the marketplace and that's what retail traders do that's exactly what i did in 1992. i got into a trade and then i tried to figure out what i was supposed to do once i was there i want you to see what it is that i was showing last night and even though i'm not personally willing to risk my live account right now because of the conditions that we have at the present ukraine and all that business all the uncertainties you know potential black swan event anytime can pop off and i don't want to expose myself to that measure of risk especially since i have hit all my numbers the market is delivered to what i expected in my analysis so i'm not worrying about trying to get in and do anything else so how do i manage that desire to get back in and do some more i go right to a demo account i work inside of a paper account it provides me context it keeps me glued obviously to what the market's doing so i'm staying plugged in if you will close to the market being able to read the tape so that way i can answer student questions i can still teach around the markets doing right now and that way my students can still appreciate the level of depth that i'm providing but i'm not taking on monetary risk when i don't believe it's wise for me to do so because if i'm wrong let's say i'm wrong and i traded today with live funds or if i traded on monday and i lose what i gained in february that would eat at me all through the month of march so it's toxic thinking and i learned that the hard way many years ago so what i'm going to show you obviously was executions in the trading view paper trading account but i want to make sure you understand because it's so many people out there that have this issue with me teaching in a demo which is compliance like i'm not licensed to give you trade advice so i operate through the function of a demo account to protect me and protect you you know you can't make that money you're not following me in a trade so if i was wrong you don't take a financial loss and if i'm right you can't make money and get tricked into thinking that the only way you're gonna make money is to follow me see there's a balancing that's being done there and if i'm wrong if i don't know what i'm doing and these things don't work they'll fail on the demo account just as easily they would be failing in the live account so with that foundation laid let's go into the discussion so idea is we went below this low i don't want to sell it short even though i'm bearish so what's it likely to reach up into well i'm thinking it could potentially trade up into this up closed candle here okay i'm thinking it could trade into that the low or the open of that candle so that's kind of like the magnet or the draw on liquidity so it also could reach up into this little area right here because there's a fair value got there just like we had it here and here and filled in it can go right up into this go right up there and then still resume going lower it might need to go up into that so i went in this morning and i was watching the nasdaq and the e-mini s p e s p had a lot of energy to the upside and usually these markets move in tandem that means they're generally moving together and even though that nasdaq was a little bit lethargic and wasn't trying to go up as quick and as fast as es or e-mini s p the tendency is that it will be drawn to the same degree that the other indices were so if es was higher and q which is nasdaq futures should be you brought higher in sympathy all boats rise in high tide in basically what i'm saying now if we look at the hourly chart this is what i was seeing i was trading all this in a demo account and it ran up into levels it became absurd now so i satisfy my itch when i'm not trying to trade with the live account in the demo account and i'll run them up real quick there is no fraud required and none of those things are required to make these things compound and blow up really quick in terms of the equity increases but i'm going to show you how even with a micro account so if you haven't already noticed this is the micro e-mini nasdaq so every one point or four ticks is equivalent to two dollars okay and i went in with the idea that i'm using a micro account with a discount broker and a discount broker i'm hypothetically using while i'm taking these executions is i'm hypothetically trading with an amp amp futures account and i'll show you their margins and show you the details as to what i'm basically implying by doing these things here down closed candle after a run up we retraced went down inside this gap see that this area here when it trades down towards this gap this is the draw on liquidity up here as well near term so above these relative equal highs we have what livestocks or buy-side liquidity so i'm thinking that the algorithm is not letting price go lower so it's going after everyone that's been profitable going short so where are their stops right here so we're just going to call it 14 110 okay real simple the market starts to rally and leaves this down closed candle i'm going to watch to see if it can trade back down into that because if it does i'm going to treat that as a bullish order block remember what i taught last night if the move has been bullish down closed candles should not be violated down closed candles should not be violated they're going to act as support bearish market moves up close candles should not be breached and broken through never even come back so when you're bearish and you're watching the market go down and you see candles starting to form a potential up close candle you as a neophyte that is new to trading these are the moments where you get scared you basically snap yourself out the desire to hold the trade and you just collapse the trade because you can't handle it it's that overwhelming uncertainty that eats at you like mental cancer it just literally makes you want to just get out of the trade even when you're profit you ever feel that the trade's profitable and you're like i just can't stand it anymore i gotta get out you're making money your trade is profitable quote unquote in a demo it's worse when you have live account funds and you have a profit because if you don't have the wherewithal and the experience of submitting to these ideas and watching them come to fruition over and over again months of experience not just a week or day you're going to feel like you just want to collapse the trade so when i teach my students when you're looking for a price move that's going to be a long-term price swing not that this is a long-term price swing in the sense of time but on this time frame for one hour this is a nice decline it's a prolonged price swing it's not like little tiny little movements in here and vice versa we have it here it's going higher so all the down closed candles does it go below this down close candle when it starts to retrace no we expect this to be areas where they're going to accumulate more long positions we retrace going down into an imbalance and the market rallies above the down close candle does it support price yes time of day is important so i'm watching when price comes back down into it here i'm taking the opening price extending it out in time when that occurs then i know i have a setup where i can go long but i want to go into the time frames a little lower than the hourly chart give me a little bit more context because we do have a low that has a higher low to the left and a higher low to the right so that makes this what enemy term low this retracement here this might be trading into an imbalance which is what i'm teaching you to look for but the overall market structure is it's likely to go higher and aim for a run above these highs by side liquidity resting right up there so we're going to take these levels this red level is anchored to this here relative equal highs five stops are above that rallies comes back down in we're looking to see if it wants to run through that notice this high in this high it creates what relative equal highs retail-minded traders are going to see that and say oh this is exactly what the text say about resistance so it's acting as a ceiling price acting like a ceiling what should they expect to see price do go over so here's that level where the body stops are we're above it rather here's that hourly down closed candle which is a bullet shorter block notice the down closed candle is made up of two candles on the fifth minute time frame price moves away from it goes above it right here does it create an imbalance here yes that is how you determine your high probability bullish order block it must have the imbalance coupled with the down closed candle and the underlying narrative that it's likely to go higher to reach for buy side liquidity period okay it's it's that's it there is no engulfing candle does this forget all that you don't need that okay it's the gap plus the down closed candle plus the idea that's likely to go for my side liquidity that's it okay so i just noticed by the way there's a guy out there trying to hawk a seven dollar indicator and he says he's the real deal and it's all about order blocks and i'm not going to change the name on that just let you know so we're trading down into this imbalance here but now we're doing it at the time of day after the equity is open at 9 30 in the morning new york time so volatility the initial move is technically the incorrect move going into the opening at 9 30. so this is like a judas swing so think about what we're seeing here now the markets likely go up above this level here to take the buy side because the market's unwilling to go lower the algorithm keeps pressing higher higher it retraces down into the 930 opening this is that fake move don't chase this and don't chase going higher right before the equity is opening 930 either so you have to take a step back and figure out what is your looking for well i'm looking for a discount market low to high i'm below 50 yes i'm inside the order block yes the equities opening has happened i'm bullish and it has traded lower so public is going to be thinking what it's resistance it's going to keep going down to what there's your support level because it bounced there last time so they're going to think there well it doesn't do that down to a five minute chart it hits the order block and then rallies what is this what's your favorite gun market trades back down in overlaps that gap between this candle's high and this candle is low this right here that right there that is one order block with a lower time frame order block and a fair value cut you can take that trade if you know what you're looking for and you understand bias narrative and where the liquidity matrix is likely to lead to later on which is drawing up above this red level here my stops are above here so if they're going to send the price higher from here and start rallying that supposes that there's someone that got on board long here where would their ideal exit be six points higher 10 points higher no you're going to want to take it up here where there's willing buyers with buy stocks to protect their short positions so when the market trades above that level the buy stops become market orders to buy the market which floods the market with liquidity for those that have bought down here they can sell to those willing buyers at a higher price which they're waiting for down here and waiting for that price rally to go up now as the market goes higher the expectation is my expectation was i want to go along in here and reach for this high this was my entry idea that it's overlapping filling in that gap and it's an order block here with a higher timeframe order block there so there's an hierarchy higher time frame to a lower time frame with the idea framed on it's going higher for buy side i have an intermediate term low forming and now this when it fills in that gap once that happens what did i teach you last night this becomes an intermediate term low this low should not be taken out once it starts rallying it should not come back down here what else did i teach you if price is going higher down closed candles should support price well it trades above it here this down close candle is high right there it trades above it on this candle right there and starts going higher but then look what happens it starts to go back down you might come down here and stop me up i'm not thinking that i'm looking at this down close candle thinking it's only going right back down into this down close candle to accumulate more long positions so smart money traders are going to be buying more here like i did rallied we have down close candles we went above it i'm not worrying about the market as long as it doesn't take out these two down close candles trades down gets real close to that but does it eat up and go through that range of these two down close candles no it just retraces down into what an imbalance why so smart money can buy again like i did the market rallies again and goes into the bicep equity order block trades through it here get long fair value got order block retracement get long order block imbalance with the fair value gap trades back down doesn't even come back down into the order block this is classic it generally doesn't like to go all the way back in rebalance when it's that close to the profit objective so the algorithm only has a small little retracement inside the fair value gap so you would be a buyer just that that candle is low it runs right to the target now i know some of you just don't trust me these are trading view execution errors and i'm going to log in to trading view and actually show you by highlighting these actual arrows but i'm going to take you down into the charts they'll all be all the way down into a 30 second chart so you can see the grouping of where i actually entered with this logic okay now remember enemy term low is down here this should never be overtaken until the objectives reached so all this price action leg here is i trust that it's going to keep going higher as long as the down closed candles keep price above it above what above the down close candles that's going to be supporting each new leg higher the market should not retrace back down below those so what am i saying for trailing stop losses you do not want to take your stop loss if say you brought it down here like i did and your stop was below the middle of this candle that's mean threshold of the bullshort block so i don't think it's going to go down below that once i'm entering then it starts around goes above this candle's high my stop-loss must remain below this candle's low because it can dig into that candle because it's going to act as a order block then the market rallies away comes back down retraces now if i put my stop loss inside this area here i'm stopped out prematurely chances are you probably wouldn't have the wherewithal to get back in you'd think well i just lost out one potential profit i made a little gain but i'm afraid to get back in you because it took me out that's infancy that's because you don't know what you're doing everybody was like that i was like that but you grow out of it if you do the same things i'm teaching you over time it's built into your understanding and it's ingrained in your understanding about price delivery the market rallies above takes out these two down closed candles now the stock can be raised from whatever would be below this down close candle now it can be raised below this down closed candle because the idea is these closed candles are one order block that should not be violated if it's bullish if it comes down and breaks the low of these down closed candles well there you go you probably did the right thing by getting stopped down because it might be failing and going lower how's that for logic you're not gonna be perfect i'm not perfect even though you see these errors on the lowest candle here and it goes out to the exit here right above that this is not photoshopped i've never had to do a photoshop okay i've never had to do that but i'm teaching you the logic right out of last night's lesson i went right into the market this morning no it's not done with a live account but i'm showing you in theory with the application of a demo account which is the same live data that would be utilized in my td ameritrade account or your live account if you have one these candles are forming just like they would be in your live account but i'm executing with the logic i'm teaching you right out of last night's lesson now here is the one-minute chart all right so here we're over in trading view everything is live printing right now this is where we're at at the moment it's just hanging around that old high now i'm not upset i missed this move here i could care less i'm going for logical places where liquidity is going to be resting and i'm entering in logical places that would reasonably expect to see price advance higher from where i'm buying it's not complicated but watching last night's lesson can feel like you're trying to learn a foreign language and expect it to understand how to speak it fluently two hours later don't let that happen okay i can make these lessons as deep as i want them to be but i'm showing you how i'm taking very complex topics and simplifying them in a manner that hopefully is easily received by you as a student so i showed you the hard perspective last night that's advanced market structure now i've simplified it within the scope of what i teach in this youtube channel do you see the difference it's only in the manner of how i'm teaching it but it's the same things it's the same ideas that i've just simply made it easier i've created a language that helps me communicate what i taught last night in a much more palatable method so that way it's not as complicated seeing it like this this makes sense to you all you're like okay now we're back into this stuff it makes sense now i'm teaching you the same thing i taught you last night i'm just not teaching it to you at the degree that is in my head you might be thinking well you know keep it to yourself i see i don't need to see it like that and that's okay i get it it's fine but this right here these are the elements that make up really simple logical setups that repeat every single week and many times every day so i started i ran up the other paper trading account to like 200 some thousand dollars this morning and i was thinking myself okay now we're in territories it's just gonna feel silly you're not gonna have any interest in seeing that it's it at that point it becomes okay now we're absurd you know it's just ridiculous you're not going to believe that this is possible or maybe some of you do and you think you want to go out there and try to do the same thing with your live account either one of those things are not my goal okay it's just me losing myself in price action so i treat it like a game it's a puzzle so i'm looking for the outcome of a specific trading session or a trading day and i'm trying to navigate those candlesticks and that's what you're seeing here if i hover over top of these little arrows okay you can see that they're not photoshopped and you make them appear by going into the trading view settings and you click the little execution box here watch below the swing lows and above that something high you'll see them toggle on and off it's all going on and off okay so this is proving precision number one it's proving theory in action and it's proving that it's not flawed logic none of this is retail absolutely none of it there's nothing here that's elliott wave none of it's harmonic none of it is supply and demand none of this is chris laurie's stuff i have a lot of chris laurie students lots of them and they'll tell you this isn't even taught in his stuff either so with that said let's go over to the paper trading account this is just again illustrate for the folks that say well you know you can't really grow an account if you're using micro accounts and that was some of the comments i got also and i'm like stop thinking you need a lot to make a lot you don't you need to be able to compound the things that you see me do in these accounts and they're being parlayed up really quick every time i'm buying like i bought right here let me see if i can get this to go away for a second when i bought the three micros here the next time i see a buy signal that's below the area i'm aiming for above that red level i'm gonna try to buy more but i'm not gonna buy more than three i'm gonna buy now two i'm pyramiding i'm building the biggest position initially and then every time i buy in again i'm building it with a smaller position than i had prior to the when i'm entering now because i have all the equity behind that entry with three supporting the two i'm buying here so even if it starts to re you know retrace too deep on me i have the ability to weather a little bit more whereas if i say i want to be a buyer of one here two here three here that's an inverted pyramid it's not stable imagine a pyramid upside down and it's balancing on its point it's not it's not a solid foundation it's wobbly so i'm building the biggest base at the bottom of the pyramid or position size in its initial position entry so i'm buying three here then i'm buying two here then i'm buying one here and then i'm letting it run to my profit objective okay with that said starting with a hypothetical ten thousand dollar account just this morning over 21 one trade with three scalings okay i consider this all one trade i don't consider this three separate trades it's one trade scaled in largest middle last portion then it runs to my objective so the account history starts with ten thousand dollars here ends with twelve thousand one hundred eleven dollars demo money okay the history tab shows you here and if i'm not mistaken i have everything shown don't know yeah time everything's toggled here nothing's hidden none of that and then you can see over here all the business there okay so my question to you is this who cares if you gotta trade a micro account three micros two more micros one more micro that's six micro contracts that requires technically twelve hundred dollars so i really didn't need the ten thousand dollars to do these trades but in my mind with proper leverage and money management ten thousand dollars with this position size and gearing that's optimal anything more than this would have been too much leverage for that account to make 21 plus in one trade who's going to argue against that being well above average now what happens if you do that once a week and that's your trade and you stop and once you hit it you end your trading that's it and then you go to a demo account you have any idea the leaps and bounds that you can have in your equity increasing and the peace of mind knowing that you don't have to over trade that's what i'm trying to cultivate here in this community folks i'm not trying to create monsters that they trade every single day because i say these likely form every single day but they absolutely form every single week that is not an invitation for you to go out and say ict said trade every day no it's not what i said i'm saying if you miss a trade you're likely to find one tomorrow well not tomorrow because it's saturday but you know what i mean the next trading day so there's a balancing act that you have to have when you're listening to me you just can't take one comment that i say and take it completely out of context and say well i see he's a day trader and he's proven that he's really precise these concepts work i watched a couple videos i trusted so now i'm gonna go out looking at charts and i think i see it forming right now and i'm going in all in i'm in it and then you're sitting down writing an email to me saying i blew my account whose fault is that it's not mine it's yours when i blew my accounts it wasn't my broker's fault it was mine i did not know what i was doing i was out of control taking 60 70 trades in a day when you lose control and you have no idea what you're doing it's impossible for you to execute like this you have to think about these examples as the goal not that you want to be this precise right from the beginning because you can't be no one is it takes time to grow into that in your understanding but it takes some measure of goal setting that you have to have you know you listen to some people after they pretend to be teachers they'll say having a weekly goal or a daily goal is the stupidest thing in the world really i guarantee you these people are not profitable that say that they're hit and miss they have periods of drawdown that are much longer than most people would be willing to endure and if you don't aim for a target you're going to hit nothing 100 of the time you have to have a goal so if your goal is to hit nothing then obviously don't set a goal but i set very low hanging objectives in front of me these things are extremely easy for my capability and for many of my students from the 2016 group and 2017 group they can take trades like this in fact i have a woman in my group from the first group from australia that is phenomenal she does very very well and these are trades that i believe that even you as a youtube student in this mentorship on my youtube channel i believe in six months of practice and looking at price action you can do this yourself and do it consistently consistently what do you mean every day michael no one time a week finding something like this and working that position in like that absolutely i'm making myself available twice a week this is an extra video today because i know last night's video was a little bit more deeper than you're accustomed to and i'm not suggesting or implying that the lessons are going to go that direction i'm just stating that when i'm studying market structure i'm studying with that degree and more but i had to create a language that gets to generally the basis of what that is doing without all the complications within it so be glad that i'm not requiring you to understand that degree because the language i'm teaching like in here is accomplishing the same method just doing it without all of the extra acrobatics because i know what you're going to be questioning you're probably looking at your chart thinking how do i classify this swing high is any term high versus a short term high in a long term high how does he know right that's the part you're never going to get so i had to create a language that makes it simple and that's what you see in my lessons on this youtube channel i showed by comparing and contrasting where i came from and what i'm providing to the public i can show you just how complicated the real intricacies are behind these marketplaces but you do need to know certain things that repeat and they're very generic in price and they're not linked or built upon the foundation of anything that's retail logic none of that stuff not support resistance not any of those other disciplines that people use and you make businesses around selling books and courses and such so one of the cool things that if you still are a trader that uses like elliott wave and harmonix and things like that if you start studying what i'm teaching you for free right here you're gonna find that your trades that win have my information underneath and when your trades fail the things i'm teaching you here are missing see this is what i asked last night in the closing the video and i'm closing this video now again the mystery that plagues all speculators is what trading approach is the one that's going to make me money and i don't have to worry about losing more money in flawed approaches of trading what you're saying is there's a method out there that is better than everyone else i'm humbly submitting to you you have found it it's not costing you anything but it's going to require some work it's going to require some time effort it's going to feel like you can't get it it's going to feel like you're never going to understand it that's all normal it's all normal but you'll get it there's folks in my 2016 group that couldn't get it they got it now it took them a couple years others they get it real quick i don't understand why some get it quicker than others i just know that it's like that and you might be one of those slower learners it's okay i was a slow learner but once you learn it it's yours you don't forget it's like riding a bike and that should be your passion and your pursuit to get to know how to do this like riding a bike you can put the bike down for a couple years and then get back on again and just like you never stop writing it and that's a comfort and a confidence that is something that i can't articulate in the words and if you are able to find consistency and profitability it doesn't matter what you're doing in the economies then doesn't matter how much it's going to cost you for a gallon of gas or how much it's going to cost you on your groceries because you can outpace inflation if you know what you're doing in these markets that should be your goal always outpace inflation and there should be no concern i'm not promising you rich can you get wealthy with this sure you can am i promising it's going to happen for you no way will you lose money in the process absolutely i'm guaranteeing you're going to lose money every trading system discipline educator everybody loses in trading they take losses some take stunning losses and others just take mediocre losses that are just nuisance other traders that are really really good can have periods of drawdown and then regain that equity draw down back and it's like it didn't even happen not even skip a beat that's experience these are all bridges that you're going to cross you're going to cross them at times and intervals that i can't outline in advance for you but i generally know the concerns and questions that you have at this point my request to you is to suspend those feelings that you have to have all the answers right now because you don't you have to be more diligent about placing yourself in front of the charts and back testing and researching what i'm showing you because it's there and by seeing that over and over again it's better than a book it's better than a course it's better than a mentorship that you pay because i'm teaching you how to go into price and price will teach you it will teach you it's repeating so if it's repeating and you're looking at it constantly you are training your eye to see what it does by default when you buy a book and you look at the examples in the book each chapter has an idea that it's trying to focus on how many examples do you generally see just a handful at most right but remember what was like when you got a trading book for the first time and you looked at it and you saw bearish diversions and bullish divergence was the caustic indicator and it made it lower low in the price but it didn't make a lower low in the stochastic and it was a bullish divergence and you were thinking man i can see that that's easy and then you start looking at it on a live chart and when you thought it was diverging it just kept going lower in price they're only going to show you the examples that help sell the book because they don't want you to return the book i'm teaching you how to go through price action and fared out these repeating signatures and it isn't just a handful of examples it's every week every day and it won't stop so enjoy your weekend i will touch base with you on tuesday lord willing and until then be safe

all right so i'm going to do a execution i got requested to show how i use this model here you got there we had a market structure shift to the upside i'm looking for a gap fill from friday's close so i'm going to go long here 12 micros of the mini nasdaq or i'm sorry micro nasdaq futures contract so i'm going to look for price to drop down into that fair value gap and look for a run above fourteen thousand one sixty right now i have my initial interest at fourteen thousand one eighty i'm thinking fourteen thousand two twenty is possible today there's my limit entry okay and i'll show you where we're at so there's the closure of the fair value gap now i'm watching price i'm going to see it start expanding on the upside i'm not watching the number underneath that profit okay that's not what i'm watching i'm watching the candles is it constantly going towards that small little fair value gap around fourteen thousand one twenty two fourteen thousand one thirty eight or so i wanna see it go through that now they can start to consolidate in that area and reaccumulate for new longs kind of like a pausing maybe like think like a bowl flag that's kind of like what i anticipate forming between 14 1 20 14 [Music] 140 in that area similar to what we just watched right there so far the expansion on the upside solid it looks good i'm thinking i might take the limit order up to 14220 but we'll see how we trade above the short term high made prior to 10 o'clock in the morning little run above new equity high nice placement on the entry that's probably random all right by side sitting right around that 14160 level that's in the crosshairs right now typically you'll see it usually consolidate around here maybe small little retracement gets everybody thinking it's time to sell short remember resistance ideas from retail are going to see that 160 and say okay i'm gonna get short because it went down from there the last time so i'm not thinking that i'm thinking it's gonna like swat bust through the door and run up into that 14 180 i might adjust that in here okay so that's kind of like my best case scenario and this is what i'm going to try to take six contracts off above here so i'm thinking if it runs there i'll take six off to fund the position roll the stops to even and then see if i can get that limit order at fourteen thousand two twenty smaller consolidation around that fair va gap level as i mentioned before reaching into an order block now looking at e-mini s p micro just to get a feel looks like it wants to run as high as well so it kind of like gives me fuel or confidence that this is going to run up into that level so i'm going to take my six contracts off and i'm gonna change my mind and close it here because it's getting real close to the closure of that gap i might be wrong but uh just for general principles 14220 i think is doable all right there's the business limit order filled again i'll hover over top the entry so you can see it all right there is your entry and that's not bad it's the low candle that's what i like to show you guys there's the limit order exiting there so hopefully found this insightful james there's your example until next time be safe

all right so this is going to be an update to the YouTube channel because there's a lot of people freaking out thinking I'm missing or gone I'm on vacation folks but uh I took the opportunity to sit down here this morning with you and try to hopefully make a mile marker on the equity on this Live account I'm going to try to hit ,000 so I'm watching this potentially make a fair value Gap I want to see that swing High broken let's see if we get that here and again this account is really meant to show like averaging like 20% a month I get questions all the time like you know what do I think a student that has gone through all the teachings have worked out a model you know what could they recently expect to see and what could be done without really pushing the envelope and this is kind of like my answer to that also to kind of like remind everybody I'm not just finding cherry pick trades in AO account I can trade with live funds too all right so we're about to break that swing high if it does that'll be bullish Market structure I'm thinking we can trade back to on the daily chart back to like 14,000 but that's a little bit of a stretch so far intraday okay we have the market structure bullish now so there's a fair value Gap I'll highlight that I'll go into the chart here I'm watching this candle see how it closes because that will complete our imbalance so you can see that right there okay give me another right there that's the low end of the fair value G this thing's always tricky all right so now we have to close of that candle so now I can I'm a little off on that cuz I'm clumsy with uh thinker swim change the color here so you can see a little bit better now it's technically the open so it's a little bit of volatility that comes in here it can overshoot that low I don't care if it does if it goes back up into the fair value capap I will buy it okay now when you're entering on like the opening like 9:30 equities opening uh you could take a long entry here but you don't know how far it's going to whip below that low and you could be wrong and painfully wrong so what I'm watching is does it want to go below that short-term low that's already created moments ago which would be outside and below the fair value Gap and it does not negate the fair value Gap because I'm using narrative narrative is is I expect people to look at that and say okay it's going to go up and they're already trying to buy right now now but their stop loss is going to be below that swing low so sell stops are resting at 13,612 they just took those now now this is a high-risk entry long there but I'm watching price now entering that same fair value got so one more time to see if it wants to poke a little bit lower and I'm again my daily bias is bullish so I'm looking for higher prices so I'm going to go and aim for the 80 level that'll give me a nice figure to run to 50,000 on Equity I do believe it's going to go higher but I'm on vacation so I want to kind of like let me take this long entry and there you go all right so now I'm watching price and I want to see it expand up now because it's the opening and I don't know where if we whip below that low I'll give it a chance to go below it just by a little bit and I'll close it at Market generally I like to trade with a stop loss but if I'm trading the open like this stops can be taken really really easily and then reverse and then never give you a chance to be in it so I'm allowing myself a little bit of flexibility I'm not trying to encourage you to trade without a stop LX believe me I'm I'm right here ready to click and close it if it trades below it and I want to see to expand up now I want to see an energetic run above the swing high that was formed just to the left of where we are right now there is a fair value Gap at the 680 level and it's above equilibrium so it would be a premium market so that's why I'm going to be targeting the 80 level plus it's around 50 handle so that gives me about $1,000 or more all right so now right now at this moment I want to see it expand aggressively not you dilly dally around I want to see it really try to spread its wings and take off and start moving there's a small little fair value Gap in the last three candles up I don't think it needs to fill that in or even revisit it but if it were to I would expect price to be you know supported by that so other words not going below the 630 level okay now at this moment I could put the stop loss on at my entry and if it takes me out then I'm would basically move to the sidelines and wouldn't take any more trades today because it's F1 see and FC you can trade in the morning but you got to be done early if you're trading equities it's important to be aware of the economic calendar because we're probably going to have a lot of volatility later on today I still think they'll push it higher with that so here's my limit order I'm going place it there and we'll see if we can get this puy to reach up there and grab it I mean I feel confident it's going to go way beyond that but short little Scout out very little draw down about three handles of draw down if that from the entry or the the candle I entered I want to say it that way the low from my entry was only like three handles below I have to have to go watch the video and see what the actual draw down was from the point of entry I'm not sure if I had any if I did then that's what it was limited to 60 bucks or so not bad if you're trying to make $1,000 had a small little Scout early in the morning all right and now this is where neight Traders or newbies they get nervous hit the wrong thing here I always think I'm on the other platforms I use a trade station and I use trading View and it's different settings and different things you can look for all right so there's my fill on the limit order rounding out the day and the month of March I will not be taking any more trades this month so $1,255 on two trades about $15 or so in commissions so take that off of there that will be the net for the day I'll take you over to the monitor tab here after I scrunch this up and show you the the run on the price now I think it's going to go higher but here's the monitor tab showing the actual trades today and you can see the profit and loss since I started this account and the commissions which are high because I did a lot of latency tests and I've done a lot of things that would kind of like mimic what a new Trader would do once they get into live fund trading

all right folks welcome back this lesson i'm going to talk about the idea of multiple setups inside of the trading sessions so there's a morning session and there's a pm session when you're working with the new york index features if you look at the market in terms of a split day the new york lunch hour between noon and 1 o'clock p.m new york local time 8 30 in morning to noon that's essentially the morning session there can be multiple setups inside of that now some of the things i've noticed in the comment sections of the videos some viewers and students are asking what do i mean by multiple setups like what does it look like and i kind of want to touch a little bit on that tonight also i want to give you a little bit more perspective on how you can look for additional ways of trading what it is i'm sharing here if we look at the s p futures mini contract for june 2022 you can see we recently traded up above the relative equal highs so buy stops and buy side liquidity were resting right above here so as the market drove above that we always have the likelihood of seeing it continue going higher but whenever it goes above relative equal highs and then we get a swing high like this that being the high here lower than the higher candle here and the next candle after this candle it has a lower high as well so it's a swing high not to be confused with a fractal that's used like an mt4 okay that is not what i'm talking about okay that takes more candles to make it and by then five candles later it's just you've already missed the move so swing high here since this candle closes the next day i'm looking for something to create an opportunity to go short so we could be anticipating a open here rally power three which is what i already taught on the youtube channel the accumulation manipulation distribution and then incorporating the next level of analysis which is understanding whether we're going to be in a premium or discount market now obviously we're on a premium market we're above old highs here we really stretched out on the outside from this high if we start to go lower this down close candle is your bullish order block okay the idea of it trading into that down closed candle once it goes above these highs that's favorable that's something that could potentially happen now obviously i have the benefit of hindsight here but i promise you if you if you study what i'm teaching you you'll see this repeating okay so the market does in fact trade down into this down closed candle that is your bullish order block but i want to go inside this particular day here which is obviously friday and we're looking at the internals behind what it is i'm trying to teach you and how you can find multiple setups inside of each respective session the morning session and the pm session all right so here is the hourly chart on the s p futures mini contract for june 2022 and i kind of like wanna bring your mindset back into what we're looking for and that is the power three we're looking for an expansion move direction higher or lower in this case we're looking for it to go lower because we have the daily bullish order block level that line here level 4504 and look at the lay of the land okay what is it that we see also in the price action well go to the left you can see we have a relative equal lows we have this low and we have this low here so they're relatively equal not exactly that's why i named them relatively equal lows the idea of liquidity resting below here by itself without the order block is likely but it's further likely if we have a discount array which is that bullish order block on the daily chart so we have multiple factors here leading to the likelihood of this area being probed for the purpose of pairing liquidity the cell stops basically being rated initially in the morning we were seeing the market trade higher higher higher higher and then we broke lower attacking the sell side liquidity here and then aggressively running into the daily bullish order block i want you to take a look at this framework from this high down this low and this being a fulcrum point that being if this high trades to this low and we break this low how far can we go down i'm going to touch on that in the next slide but for right now i want you to think about how the opening price what's the opening price well there's two if you're trading index futures the opening price is midnight at new york time and that's this candle here that's the opening price here and then there's another opening price at 8 30 in the morning the opening price in the candle that begins 8 30. it doesn't matter what candle you use i see a lot of questions popping up about that like what's the opening price and what can we use as soon as you have 8 30 beginning a new candle it could be a one minute candle it could be a three minute candle an hourly candle 15 minute candle whatever that opening price is that's what you want to note at 8 30. so if you're bearish ideally you want to see the market trade above that opening price this is going to be manipulation okay the manipulation is the running above a key level when we are bearish we're expecting this to go lower all of this is basically market protraction where it's a judas swing okay the market's going in the opposing direction that it's likely to go to later in the day so later in the day we expect this to go lower where is it going to go below this low if it accelerates below this low where could it go below here okay then we have the bullish order block on the daily chart so we have a lot of things coming together that draw on a great deal of probabilities now probabilities are not absolute guarantees okay that that's not the case in trading if that was the case i would never take a losing trade you would never take a losing trade we wouldn't need you stop losses and be great but unfortunately we have to contend with risk that being the case we have to at least build the idea around the likelihood of a scenario unfolding but being prepared if it doesn't so if this market is opening here at midnight and it starts to rally we can anticipate this selling off but if it can sell off from here and trade below this low how much further can it go below these relative equal lows obviously we have the daily bullish order block level here right here now let me take you back up real quick that's this level here the opening price on this down close candle that's the order block extending that line out in time you end up with this on the hourly chart so we drop down into that level and look at the reaction there it's nice isn't it so going below this low that's the initial target then reaching below the relative equal lows over here because that's where cell cell equity is going to be residing then tapping into that bullish order block on the daily chart but how much further can we go below that level how far beyond the actual order block level can we go well i'm going to zoom in on a 15-minute time frame i've already taught this in other lectures but i want to revisit it here because this is what you're looking for when you're doing your analysis when everything starts to show a willingness to want to go lower how do we know it's going to go lower well we have the swing low here decisively broken see that this low broken heart then we trade back up into the imbalance here so the fair value gap we trade up into it here at this point we anticipate the candles past this or the new forming candles to trade lower and trade below this low and if it does go below this low we're looking at this price point here that low as a fulcrum point that being measuring this high down to that low that same measurement of distance and we expect that projected lower okay so this is my swing trading model and i'm applying it to targeting so the way you do it is you take your fibonacci and you anchor it to the highest body it could be open or closed it doesn't make a difference but you anchor it on that notice i'm not putting on the high here and i'm doing the same thing with the lowest open or closed in this swing low this retracement up i'm measuring the distance in terms of range with the bodies of the candles the first time i taught this on youtube i had a lot of folks scratching their head and many trolls saying he doesn't even know how to use a fib i'm showing you how the algorithm is going to read the price okay the wicks and the tails are all distractions that's all going to be largely attributed to what the if you're especially if you're trading with 4x and obviously i'm aware that this is not 4x but i learned this through the models that i employ with forex now it's a carryover in terms of analysis because you can apply it here as well it wasn't always like this when there was open outcry only and there was no electronic trading this wasn't as pure as you're going to see and has it's been shown in the past by me in other videos and examples but by having a measurement from the highest body in this swing up in this swing low the lowest body that means the lowest open or closed okay i'm anchoring the fib on that the settings on the fibonacci i have included here and these are the ones that's highlighted for this illustration so below this low we're looking for it to run into sell side so if it goes below this low and aggressively expands lower this could be your next target 45 14 and a half if it goes below this one we can anticipate it trading down to what 45 0 1 and a quarter now the question you're going to probably have in your mind is okay this is all fine and great but how do we know which one to pick ict if you put a thousand lines on your chart ict eventually they're gonna somebody's gonna see one of those levels get hit and then you're gonna make a video and say see how smart i am i've seen all of your arguments i've seen that kind of stuff tossed around in the forums and such so if we look at the idea that that 45 04 and a quarter is just below what level that daily bullish order block at 4504 well at 4504 and we're getting a measurement down here that means we could see it trade down to that level here now if you look up here at this level right there that low is exactly the candles low right there don't take my word for it go over to trading view pull up the june contract for 2022 e-mini s p that is your daily low you can't predict daily highs and lows ict that's impossible well it is possible if you understand the elements that these algorithms operate under and my question to you is can you get any better than that is there any other measurement in terms of precision that gets you any closer to forty five zero one and a quarter not when the low is forty five zero one and a quarter look at the reaction there now the order block level is just right here but it stabs down into what the algorithm is going to measure so there's the order block it wants to go down to it anyway there's relative equal lows it knows there's liquidity down there and you have the measurement so the precision element is only going to be beneficial if you have all the other narrative incorporated with your analysis that being the market's likely to go lower because we ran out those relative equal highs on the daily chart we created this swing high we broke lower aggressively we're likely to trade in that daily bullish order block then we have this retracement here it completely closes in all the imbalance that's between this low and this high of that candle it rebalanced all that and then we roll over here's that gap i mentioned trades up into that we anticipate what the candles after this candle closes we want to see acceleration to the downside we get it the market starts working lower lower and finally right on a dime that candle is that low and that's your swing projection i teach in this youtube channel you will not get that measurement if you use this swing high in that swing low that's why everybody that uses fibonacci struggles oh fibonacci is a joke it's not a joke if you are doing the measurements correctly now these are just targets but they are more meaningful when you apply and layer other things in analysis like the purpose of running to liquidity below those relatively equal lows into a discount array which is the bullish daily order block when you bring that together you get these types of results which is perfection there's nothing better than this folks you cannot improve upon perfect all right so taking this a little bit further now we're into a 15 minute time frame the opening price again is this candle here which is midnight new york time the opening price that candle you extend that out in time if you're bearish and you are looking at your daily chart because the majority of your analysis should be framed on your daily chart where is it likely to go where is the expansion likely to take price higher or lower that's the main thing you're trying to look for because that's going to carve out your bias so if you know that the likelihood of price wanting to draw down this daily bullish order block and we have that level of 4501 and a quarter which is that candle's low we don't need to have that yet but we know that this is going to be a draw on liquidity because it's also below those relative equal lows that i mentioned when we're looking at the higher time frame chart so all of this here is a build up into the premium the market then breaks aggressively what does it create here what happened here we had a displacement down did that take out that swing low yes does it trade up into that imbalance right here yes does it trade above the opening price yes how many boxes did we just check off there a whole lot probabilities are now going through the roof that this is bearish then the market breaks lower trades down to the old swing low sell side liquidity resting below there watch what happens we trade down through it and then we aggressively rebalance all this down move we come right back up into it bearish order block then sells off another wave into this short term low deeper below this low and into eventually into the lunch hour and passed it for the daily bullish order block now when you look at this type of price action you might not see that as an entry but it is taught to you in this mentorship on youtube that is the lesson right here because if you look back here we have these highs we trade above it does it break below it does does it give them a balance yes does it trade up in here on the 9 30 opening yes and then does it run where we want it to liquidity and discount array in the form of a bullish order block yes but what other setups are here because i mentioned in my real money real results series where i was showing actual live account results and proving that these things make money not just in demo and by the way i appreciate all the feedback i'm getting in the commentary section of each video in the comment section but i've read a lot of the questions about you know what do i mean by having no more than four trades two trades in the morning two trades in the afternoon what did i mean by that because i read one guy he was saying i can't even find you know four examples of this and i may not be saying this correctly but you can't find that many examples of it forming over the course of a week let alone a few times in intraday so we're going to walk through today's price action and show it with clarity all right so here's the opening price again on a five minute chart here's the 15 minute time frame fair value gap and the market trades right back up into it about the opening price that's what it would look like on a 5-minute chart notice it does not look clean like it does on the 15-minute timeframe let's go back up one more time see the gap here and that run right there at 9 30. that coupled with this time frame you probably wouldn't see that as a cell you would want to see this filled in but you got to look at the higher time frame the higher time frame 15 minute time frame is providing you the framework it's giving you context that okay this is all we need we don't need it to trade up into that it could but we don't need it to so when it trades up there then it starts to break down it rebalances breaks down again works into that short term low sells off again retracement sells off again in here this is your entry at the opening so in the morning session you typically have two to three setups because you have volatility coming in at the opening opening being 9 30 new york local time that can be very tricky if you're not really sure what you're doing you can get caught up in the initial volatility and offside real quick and it can run against you aggressively and hurt you i prefer to see my students look for the initial move to kind of like qualify what you're expected lower prices right so does it give it here yes it does so how can you participate in something like that and still have the bias behind you and have multiple setups that you can take well let's take a closer look on the lower time frame here's the one minute chart here's that return back up into the fair value gap in the 15 minute time frame and wasn't so clear with the five minute but now look what we have here small little imbalance there that fair value gap right above a short term high we trade up into that there on a one minute chart you would see that as a setup for the one minute chart before i go any further i want you to pause the video i know some of you don't like to do this because you just want to get through it you're watching the video at two times the speed because i talk slow this is the time when you want to stop slow down because you will cheat yourself out of learning this is the little moments like when i'm teaching my private group these are these opportunities if you waste them you do not learn the best way okay there's a good there's a good way of learning and there's the best way of learning and the best way is actually participating not just casually watching don't netflix binge watch ict this is where you stop the video ask your spouse or whatever this give you a couple minutes to focus undisturbed that way you can pull out the things i'm trying to show you in this lesson otherwise it's just another you know event where i'm talking about hindsight but what i'm showing you here is something that repeats every single day this is how i can go in every single day and take money out of the marketplace i took the live account up another thousand dollars today so we're over fifty one thousand dollars and these are the types of setups that you can do you can find these and you don't have to have the absolute perfect entry at the opening you don't need that okay that's the benefit of what i'm sharing here publicly i want you all to have the ability to feed yourself and your own family not to rely on a job if you look for these types of setups with this logic i am confident that you can do what i just said and those that really want to supercharge it can take it way beyond that competitions you know whatever but we have the logic here that's that old short term low all i did was extend the line out because it doesn't exist in the chart over here because i don't have enough of the data showing but that short term low that was a fulcrum point remember that's this low here so i'm referencing that zone that there's where the sell side liquidity is but i want you to pause the video and go through this price action and find the setups that you would see as a shorting opportunity if your bias was in line with what i'm suggesting here as it should have been being bearish okay i'm gonna continue the conversation if you are not ready you've missed your opportunity all right so the first fair value gap here right there because we have this short term low broken with the run lower so there's displacement there obvious displacement very energetic and we have this candle is high this candle is low and the market returns back up into it you can go short there and look for what's the first objective that fulcrum point that short term low aim for the liquidity so your target would be there so you could do like say you did two contracts entry here short here too you can take one off here let it ride and then see if you can get that lower time frame objective later in the day now i don't want to take entries during the lunch hour between noon and 1 o'clock but you can take profits if you're doing like a partial like you did one here i'm sorry if you did two short contracts here you took one off at your first target and you want to see if you can get the other objective if you have a limit order at the order block level plus you know a couple points it could feel during the lunch hour you don't need to be babysitting it being in front of it then because you've already funded your position and trade by taking one off them here off and moving your stop to break even and to see what it can yield in terms of the daily range next one is here another short term low taken fair value got there we trade back up into it that's a short you can go short here and again same premise looking for the first run below here that will be your target taken there if you did multiple contracts you would get short here take two take one off this might scare you not so much probably if you were short from up here but here could be a little bit intimidating but if you've taken one of the contracts off below here even if it were to come back up and take you out and stop you out the first contract allows you to be profitable so it kind of balances things out another one is here we have the imbalance here after we aggressively move lower and then retrace back up in this is why i'm saying that that previous short if i was short from here i wouldn't be worried about this one so much because your stop would be above here now it got close to it but i've been many trades over the years where it moved within a quarter of a point without stopping me out and you know it's it's a scary feeling especially you have a lot of size behind your positions at the time you're in the trade but it's still a little intimidating because if you completely fulfill your model and follow it in all the roles and you don't want to move your stop and you just allow the stock to be taken there's been many instances in my own trading where within a quarter point it doesn't stop me out it's not like 4x these markets a little bit more professional in the sense that they're much more precise and uniform in the delivery you don't get these wild erratic little spikes and spreading you know of the price action because everybody's working with the same price here versus in forex you're trading within a pool of liquidity within your broker's in-house and they have a little bit of luxury there where they can they can open that spread on you and that's why it's a little bit trickier to operate in that versus something like this market here it doesn't mean i don't love forex still i do but right now forex is just quiet it's not doing things that i would promote in my students attention i'm telling all my students both in my private group and you all hear that this is the markets that you should be following these these markets right here the index features i'm sure there'll be a time when we transition from index features back to forex but until i see them loosen up a little bit in the currencies my attention is here okay so anyway getting short here this is a shallow run below that old low so we anticipate it to run a little bit deeper and it does okay so you could take profits below this low here as a partial and then you've seen now obviously multiple opportunities within the same morning session so it's also showing you how if you miss your entry how can you get back in line with the marketplace and still participate in these moves now there are going to be days where we don't have this many retracements back and back and back and then goes lower it'll be just one or two and it just keeps on going or many times it'll be just right at the opening and that's it you missed it it just goes right to where you thought it was gonna go for the day and you can't get mad about that you should be happy that your analysis concepts are speaking to you with that much clarity and just know that because they repeat none of you should be upset that you missed the trade like none of you nobody has the permission okay you have no right to be angry about missing a trade because they are like buses okay mass transit buses that come by like a schedule you know every certain time of the hour a day these buses are going to come around these trades are just like that you can set your clock to them okay they're they're gonna form they're gonna be there your number one goal is to understand where is it likely to go to where is it likely to reach for if you have that understood it becomes so easy to know what you're looking for notice what i said there it becomes easy to know what you are looking for i did not say it's so easy for you to make money there's a strong contrast there okay but by default over time once you have been doing the things that lead to you understanding what is you're looking for and that part becomes easier what do you think the default result was going to be from that it's probably going to be easier for you to make money over time okay so i'm keeping things in balance that we understand what i'm saying without sugarcoating it and making it sound like anybody can walk in here and do this it's gonna take some effort now you're probably looking at that pink rectangle asking yourself what the heck is that well that is the pm session by side liquidity pool what does that mean this high here was the most energetic one in the morning session it took us all the way down to what target we were looking for the daily bullish order block because it's friday because it hit the daily time frame objective it's in a discount market it's really traded lower end of week there's going to be a retracement back into the weekly range what can it aim for well you can aim for the liquidity resting right here because a lot of people are going to say well you know this is the place where my stop should be at because i want to hold on to this thing over the weekend now i don't know who has the courage to do that anymore with all the things going on around the world i personally don't have the courage to hold over the weekend it's just too many things can go wrong i'm not sitting in a potential opportunity where it's a thousand point gap against me you know we start trading on sunday no thank you i'll pass on that but this area here is where you would anticipate on fridays where liquidity could be a draw because it's going to likely pull back up into a premium what does that mean here's 8 30. here's the turning point at the 9 30 rotation so this high or we could use this high here it doesn't make a difference but i'm going to use this one because we're framing the logic because this day being bearish so this high down to the target if you put a fibonacci on this low to high and find the 50 level this is above 50 so that means above here that's a premium so the market's going to move from what a discount to a premium that's what the market does that's the algorithm does it seeks discount to premium premium to discount within that logic the market is reaching for liquidity in the form of buy stops and sell stops and or imbalances or the creation of an imbalance fair value gaps or returning back to a fair value gap okay that's all these algorithms do and they do it on the basis of time then price now that's a gross oversimplification by me but by far and large that's all these things do it's not your buying and selling pressure okay it's not the effects of the dom okay uh i got a lot of people asking me because they watched me show things in my live account and they think i traded with the dom i don't trade with the don okay i'm not looking at the dom trying to read how many orders are resting above or below because there's spoofing that goes on and those orders may not be there when the price goes there so i i don't think that the dom is something that is useful i'm only throwing that in here because i saw a lot of people in the comments asking about those types of things and i don't use them i don't use them in my trading and i don't think there's anything in terms of advantage in using it if you believe you're being profitable because you are don't let my comment change your mind and i'm not trying to open up a dialogue for debate because you're never going to convince me okay so you're okay if you're using it but i'm answering students or viewers and that's my opinion okay so i'm not trying to begin a debate about it okay so we have a pm session by celebrity pool that the market could likely reach up into and again the logic is we move from this high down to a target it's friday there's probably going to be position squaring they're going to want to take the market back higher so what are they going to reach for as an opposing move notice what i'm saying here this was the target there's gonna be short covering who's short coloring the smart money that's sold short here here here here here and here so if they're covering a short are they bearish still no so if they're not bearish what are they bullish so if they're going to be smart money and buy down here or if they're going to use this imbalance in here if it trades down into that you can see it run higher if they're going to buy it what are they going to target the buy stops up here and they're going to sell right to those buy stops they're buying this and selling it to these waiting buyers and their buy stops notice these relative equal lows they take it into the order block right below those relative equal lows because it sells what it sells the retail crowd that this was support broken what are they going to want to do when it trades back up into these relative equal lows they're going to do what sell right that creates more liquidity for buying so this is engineering buy side liquidity on the basis of sell side flow sellers coming in the marketplace these sellers they're going to have a counterparty in the form of smart money buying it they want to sell short because they see relative equal lows breaking the trends been down everything looks bearish to them because it's been going down all day long so they think naturally it's going to keep going down when it's only traded down to where the algorithm says this is what we wanted and now we're going to reprice higher we're going to move from a discount to a premium the premium intraday is going to be this area here and that's going to be where the market draws to for the afternoon session buy side liquidity all right i was going to do the pause the video type thing here but this is going to be a long video so i'm just going to go right into it all right so we have a mitigation block here and i teach that in the youtube channel but we have market structure breaking we come back down into the mitigation block and we also have the imbalance here they got there so we can be a buyer here and remember the 45 32 the 45 40 level go back up to this chart here right in here so this high right here to here think about those price ranges we trade up into it here so buying here and aiming for that liquidity up here that would be your target from buying to getting out there selling to those waiting buy stops the next one is here the market trades down in and i count you to go into your chart i left this out for your own personal study but if you look to the left go over here you'll see an old high okay old highs are a discount array if we trade above an old high that old high becomes a discount array this is where not all the time but this is where old highs being broken become support that's why sometimes the books have it right that's why sometimes your analysis will be right about specific key highs and lows but notice they're not always consistent and that's the problem so you want to know what makes a old high or an old low real supportive resistance when you have the logic when i'm framing here because we know the likelihood of the market's going to draw up into this area here because that's where the buy stops are resting above the marketplace when it hit the order block down here so what we're saying is the market's going to bounce from here up into this vicinity here so if the market comes back down in and touches it could have touched this high here but there's an old height to the left over here you'll see it it trades down and hits that and it also fills in an imbalance when you have that old highs broken will act as support so there's something for your notes then we have the run up into that area so it's not a bad little run now once we get up into that shaded pink area what have we done we fulfilled by side liquidity in this area here but we have a little bit more later on which obviously you can see it runs too but but here we see it do a run lower so we break below swing low market structure shifts is there any imbalances in here no but there is one right there see that here's your favorite value gap shift in market structure there retraces back up into the fair value gap you can be a seller there and aim for this low or the order block or you can wait for a confirmation entry which is we turn here after it hits that fair value gap breaks lower and then we have another break in the structure of the marketplace on the one-minute chart creates the imbalance here if everybody got trades up yes it overshoots it but we also have two fair value guys remember the rules i gave you if you have a fair value gap and a small one right above it anticipate it likely trading up into you but use this as your entry go short here and aim for the order block so if you have an understanding of how we're going to work within the intraday volatility using liquidity using the time of day using the day of week all these things come together and they make a really beautiful tapestry so you can read price action now i know there's a large number of you that are going to watch this and it's going to feel and seem like obviously anybody can go back in time and do these types of things but a lot of my trades when you see my examples and you see the things i record and show you they're using logic like this so it's not contrived it's not form-fitted it's not cherry-picked for the purpose of just being something to talk about this is what you're looking for and when you do your back testing i got a lot of questions in the comment section about this as well you go through your charts just like i'm doing here and you annotate them now in all these areas where there's empty space here or over here or over here you're putting in little notations and you're typing them out and yes it takes time yes it's tedious yes it takes a great deal of effort and desire but this stuff rewards that like it rewards it it's not like fantasy football where you know who cares if your team wins this pays you this is something that you can feed your family with okay if you need your expenses to be reduced and you don't want to get on a job or you're you know you take a pay cut maybe you had a you know job loss or whatever this skill set can fortify any weak links in your financial chain okay you want to build strength in your ability to make income and build legacy wealth it's worthwhile for you to spend time learning this and that means going back through old charts and old moves and literally going in and annotating the moves like this and mapping them out and seeing the logic that's there now do not be afraid that you're going to do it wrong all of you are going to be doing it wrong in the beginning this is a skill set in back testing you're trying to discover okay you're not trying to do things correctly in back testing back testing is you in a mode of discovery that proves efficacy if you can't see things repeating then you got to go back into the core content lessons of this youtube channel and figured out what it is i'm teaching conceptually then once you understand better what it is i'm showing you then you go back into the old data and look for those very things occurring then highlight the things in your chart that makes the most sense to you over time doing it and frankly you should be doing this at least a minimum of a year okay make it a practice of doing all that even when you start trading with live funds your trade journal should always have annotations you should always have charts saved and just constantly referring to what you witnessed in price and record it like you saw it happening and knew it was going to happen in advance that's called self-talk okay you're literally tricking your brain into seeing your annotations as something that you foreseen coming and that way when you go back and you read your journal and you study it on the weekends or you know whenever you go through a period of drawdown and you need encouragement you go back to your charts in your journal and you'll see annotations that you wrote out yourself and it tricks your brain believing that you've seen that all along now what happens by doing that over time is you have created creases in your brain where that knowledge and that pseudo experience has been retained but your brain remembers it as what a real experience that you endured but you're recording it with positive reinforcement in your commentary never put negative comments in your annotation don't say like oh i was stupid i missed this oh i'm so dumb i fell victim to the shark pattern you don't do all that kind of stuff you don't have to worry about swimming with sharks you don't have to worry about animal patterns you don't need to be worried about any of those types of things all you're looking for is liquidity imbalances time of day that's it that's it that's all this game is all about okay the algorithm is not going to try to follow some retail logic stuff it's based on where is the money where's the money who's the most easy prey right now and where is the majority of the money and that's where it's going to run for that's all it's going to do and if you strip everything you think you know about the markets away and just give me a a couple months stay with me for a couple months here and i promise you you will put everything else down and see it like this because this is the truth this is the perfect understanding of what makes these markets book that means what makes them go up and down where they turn why they go where they go why are they moving when they move and why are they arriving when they arriving at that price point it's all algorithmic and it has absolutely nothing to do with ratios it has nothing to do with anything harmonic nothing supply and demand zone nothing to do with elliott wave nothing to do with white golf nothing to do with gan none of that stuff has anything to do with it i literally have just explained exactly what these markets do that's it there's nothing else that happens the buying and selling pressure it's a myth because these markets are going to go higher regardless of how many contracts come in if they want this thing to go up here it doesn't require millions of contracts to put it there it doesn't how many contracts does it take for this candle to move from that opening price to that closing price tell me how many cam how many contracts does it take for that to happen it only needs two two transactions two transactions one here and when it gaps up here and reprices to that price point and it offers it to the market that price and someone comes in with a market order what happens boom it's it the candle has been created two trades how many contracts it doesn't make a difference you only need a transaction what yeah folks listen you can sit down and listen to these videos i'm producing and coming with the preconceived notion that everything i'm saying is nonsense it's not true and it's not valid because you don't want it to be all i'm asking you to do is put everything you think you understand put it aside for a moment just for a little while and go in and do the things i'm telling you to do i guarantee you you will absolutely fall in love with this because this is consistency this is consistency that you have always hoped for but everything else just falls short in delivering it and you're getting it for free and i'm loving it while giving it to you because i know and you're all going to see it when all these little light bulbs come on and all the people watching these videos and folks this channel is growing it's growing and this train's going to keep on rolling yeah this community is getting bigger and bigger because it's infectious results matter proof matters and when students go into this and they see the results man it's sweet isn't it isn't it sweet when you see the truth finally just laid out in front of you there's no trickery here there's no twisting of your arm give me your credit card payment you don't you don't have to blow any kisses to me okay i don't need flowers i just want you to make a real effort and then tell me what your results are what did you get from it i promise you i'm promising you you will find what you're looking for but you got to put the work into it because if you don't put the work into it it won't matter because you'll just think it's too much work and i'm telling you it only feels like a lot of work in the beginning but once you understand what you're looking for like this setup here that might be your particular setup and this up here isn't your setup this might be your setup here because it's based on that old highlights you'll find if you scroll back on your own chart that might be your setup and not this one down here that's what i'm referring to when i say when you find your unique model that means a setup that is so similar every time you take it it repeats the same general idea just in a different chart on a different day in a different time frame that's it that's all it is that's a that's your unique model you're learning how to do it with what i'm teaching you but where you're looking for it in what market and what narrative that you're looking for what makes that setup your particular setup that's a unique thing for you and that's the weird beautiful element to trading and the way these markets operate is it allows each and every one of us to have our own unique model we can all use the things i'm teaching and all fine setups within the same trading day and be opposed to every individual trade setup individually in other words we could all be doing something and not agree with any of it you took a short there i was long a little while before that or i went short and you went along somewhere else and you're ending a trade where i'm getting ready to put on a trade it's amazing but how you internalize the market what setup you're looking for there's lots of them and if you break this chart down into a 30 second chart or a 15 second chart there's even more setups everything's fractal so if you want to do high frequency trading you can do that with the second chart you may not be able to pull up second charts because you may not have the i guess the subscription level on trading view and i don't get any subscription kickbacks i'm not trying to get you to buy anything from tradingview i'm just stating that you can make this however you want and if you just want to stay on a 15-minute chart and trade a daily range okay there's no reason to do anything less than that but if you want to get busy and pyramid your positions that means like say you bought one down here or say you bought say about five down here and you bought three here and you bought two here and then you roll it up into your objective that's pyramiding your biggest position put on first then a smaller position on and then a smaller position and then that that's how you build up the equity and you get velocity in your equity growth that way versus buying one then buying two then buying forward and buying eight that that is reckless and i've done that and i've roasted accounts doing it so don't do that but hopefully this is at least got your gears turning about how you can go in and back test a little bit um how you can see multiple trade setups and how we can work with higher time frame pd arrays and the pd array matrix where it's discounted premium and premium to discount and how we use and incorporate all the different arrays where i'm sure someone new watching this your head's spinning right now you're like i have a thousand questions right now and i i need to know this no you don't need to know what you're asking for right now you only feel like you need to know right now take the things i'm showing you at the pace i'm showing you study them and i promise a couple months from now you're going to know a whole lot more than you know right now and you'll be able to go in and see things in price action that you don't even identify right now even in hindsight you just got to give yourself the time and give yourself the real effort to learn this i've stripped it down i made it as streamlined as i possibly could and i promise you will get this and until i'll talk to you next time be safe

all right folks welcome back this lesson is going to be on forex and how we can apply this model to the fx market now if you are a longtime student of mine a lot of the things i'm going to talk about in here are going to be very familiar to you i promise you the things that the newer students that just found this channel are going to feel like they're stuck on majority of it is in the free lessons in this youtube channel okay so i'm going to count you to go through those videos and you'll get your answers there okay all right so if we're looking at the euro dollar and i'll let you know that's what this is this is the daily chart for euro i want you to take a look at how price moved above these relative equal highs right here now once it did that this took the buy side or buy stops out of the marketplace here then it started going lower what would it likely be reaching for next well it took buy side out here what do you think is resting below here sell stops or sell side liquidity now just to the left notice these two little devils here relative equal lows and with this one and this one we have two areas of sell side liquidity notice this candle here which happens to be monday's trading or yesterday's trading this low did not take out that low yet notice that so we have unfinished business below here and potentially below here so if this is a daily chart even though we've come from this high and had three consecutive down close candles what is the bias the very next candle what's the bias going to be bearish we're anticipating bearishness going in so let's take that and flush that out a little bit more so here is your chart that would be annotated and you have this level in your chart while you're learning it's important to have these types of things on your chart over time all you need is a pad and something to write with and you'll write down the levels majority of time the only time i'm showing a level on my chart is for teaching purposes i like to keep my chart clean and that way i'm not forcing that bias if i see something that would allow me to like negate the whole premise that i went into the market with and either reverse or move to the sidelines i want that clarity now i say that and some of you purists in here that just simply want to do everything i say and hang on every single one of my words don't avoid or don't try to do it without having annotations like having levels drawn on your chart because you need to train yourself to see it and what i mean by that well having these relative equal highs highlighted your buy stops would be resting above here and the market will go just above that a little bit and then once those buy stops are taken for anyone that's short they're getting knocked down in a loss and that flood of orders to be buying at the market is counterparty to individuals that want to sell short so smart money is selling short up here with the expectation it's going to go below this low here below here and potentially below that low down there so today's trading we had the open it rallies up a little bit then careens through the short term low here and below the relative equal lows here not by much we'll see it but it's still there now what level on the downside after this day close if we're looking for lower prices what could be expected to draw to obviously below here and below here but what price level 109 big figure so the big figure numbers okay or the zero levels they're very influential because there's lots of liquidity that is used around those levels a lot of commerce a lot of business transactions that come in just for the sake of simplicity 0 0 level to 20 levels the 50 levels and the 80 levels so i dub them institutional price levels i teach that in the free videos in this youtube channel too all right so we're going to drop down to an alloy truck but before we get into that i'm going to revisit the swing trading idea that i taught highest up close or opening in this retracement up and the lowest open or close is here so i left the highlighted candles so you can match that up on yours and then we have this old low so below this olaf it goes below that how many pips can it go below that well we have the big figure 109 right remember the previous chart here watch over here that's essentially the 1.09 big figure so do we have any levels in here on the fib that correspond to that well we have 1.0919 that's possible then we have 1.09 that's another level that's possible and we have 1.0901 essentially almost the big figure right so we have a standard deviation from this swing to here if this is broken these are only true if this low is broken okay so this is a falcon point and this is a fulcrum point so how do we know which level we're going to aim for well we have those relative equal lows at the 109 big figure level and then we have our fib calling for these levels down here in the lowest one without going through 1.09 is this one here all right on the hourly chart with our buy side liquidity pool level here the market trades up into that area absorbing all of that liquidity then breaking down takes out a short-term low here and here and here retraces up in breaks lower then we go into today's trading the fifth prior to the day starting we know that it's likely to draw below here and then down to that 109 big figure have a lot of convergence around that 109 big figure at the beginning of the day at midnight new york local time that's going to be right in here if we see the market rally up which is what we want to see we want to see a protraction in the marketplace where it starts to go against the expected direction of the move intraday so if we're bearish and we're looking for that 109 level to be treated to and attack the liquidity below here preferably we want to see it rally first that's the judas swing okay that mark of protraction is what we're looking for for manipulation part of my concept power three which is accumulation manipulation distribution okay so once the day begins at midnight we're anticipating a move up what's it gonna be trading up into this imbalance in here okay so once it does that it kind of like forms the daily high and then the rest of the day you're gonna be looking for distribution throughout the day looking for lower prices so inside that little shaded area we're going to use that going forward so let's drop down to a lower time frame 15 minute time frame here is that imbalance that doesn't look that clean on a 15 minute time frame but the hourly is what we're framing it on okay so the market trades up into that here is the midnight new york local time candle on the 15 minute time frame chart opening price is here extended out throughout the day that is your midnight new york candle opening price preferably if we're selling short we want to see price trade above this opening price this is where smart money is accumulating short positions see that so the algorithm goes higher once more higher once more higher and then again right here and then begins its descent into the daily range low now what's occurring here this is not buying and selling pressure the algorithm is offering constantly price above this opening price now every single time it rallies up just because it does that doesn't necessarily mean that it's a time for you to get in but when you couple that with time of day and price it becomes a lot better notice we have an imbalance in here so the fair value gap there and price runs up during the new york open kill zone okay so i dubbed this specific time of day between seven o'clock in the morning new york time to 10 o'clock in the morning this is specific to 4x okay these times are specific to fx payers if you're going to trade an index don't worry about that you can work with the 8 30 to 11 o'clock in your local time but for 4x the algorithm is going to operate on these specific elements of time so if we're looking at this in balance here the market runs up and it overshoots the imbalance a little bit but what's it really go to the last closed candle which is a bearish order block how do we know there's a bearish order block because we have the imbalance here and it's trading back up into after a nice move lower so this displacement fair value gap lasts up close candle touches it there's your bearish order block dropping down into a five minute chart everything being as it was on the 15 that's that order block here just being shown on a five minute chart but i'm adding now the annotation of the new york open kill zone seven o'clock in the morning begins here at the end of that line segment and ten o'clock is here so everything underneath this end the trend line here and below this part of it this all is during the new york open kill zone so you're hunting your setup for forex payers within that little block of time so during this time you're hunting your setup what price are you looking for preferably at or just above the opening price at midnight now if you are a new york session trader you want to refer to the opening price at midnight but then you want to recalibrate at 8 30 and we'll look at that in a moment but for now just notice looking at this particular day on the economic calendar we had a high impact news driver at 10 o'clock in the morning it was the ism services pmi number now before you want to start sending me emails or start sending me essay questions in the comments section of this video about what does the ism pmi number do what's it i don't care what these numbers are really discussing i don't care i don't care about the raw data i don't care what the expectation is i don't care okay what i'm expecting is the volatility in the marketplace at or around these specific times because the algorithm is going to use that injection of volatility to facilitate trades now is it trying to give you good trades no it's trying to move and rebook and reprice to levels to allow those in the know to participate it's a rigged game you're not supposed to be in it not consistently profitable let's say that way but for those that are in the know they're looking for these types of signatures and price action so they know what they're looking for in terms of when they're going to operate so as a technician they're looking for a specific element of time which is encapsulated with this segment right here seven o'clock to ten o'clock so that little bracket of time right there on a five minute chart you're hunting your setup what is the thresholds that make it high probability well if you're going short or looking to go short you want to be above the midnight opening price that's here extended out in time but now once we hit this order block here that was during the early stages of the new york open right around the seven o'clock hour the market drops and then retraces back into that news driver here at 10. so what's happening here is look closely with this swing low it went below this low here and then it rallied back up once more above the opening price at midnight does it take out this high no why doesn't it take out this high because it has an imbalance here that imbalance tells you this is an intermediate term high if we're bearish it shouldn't take this high out now again i mentioned this in a recent video i think if i'm not mistaken it was episode 12. i'm going by memory so please don't roast me in the comments section if that's the wrong one but it's basically what i'm talking about intermediate term short term and long term highs and lows or swing highs and lows a imbalance or a fair value gap associated with a swing higher swing low in this case this is imminent term high not because it just simply has a imbalance but because the narrative is we're expecting lower prices and it went above the opening price at midnight and the imbalance there when it retraces back up into this fake run ahead of the news driver at 10 o'clock the news if you will this movement here is only running right back up into the bearish order block last up close candle the body we don't i don't like to use these long tails and wicks i'll refer to them but i'd like to prefer to annotate if i'm going to show it in my examples or look to price returning back to the body of the candle right there so this return into that order block sets the stage for another move lower we get a swing high lower high to the right of this candle and a lower high to the left of it here so we have three candles making a swing high so we start looking for displacement and movement lower but looking closer after we had that shift in market structure here on a five-minute chart it retraces back up fair value gap parish order block and news this is the wild card okay when you have high impact news drivers this is going to many times scare you out of the trade or stop you out in the words if you went short back here and you started trailing your stop loss this is what that's designed to do take you out so if you're short back here or here or here how are you protecting the trade you're putting a buy stop above recent swing highs so they're jamming it up against that back above the opening price because your buy stop is going to flood the market with buyers willing to pay a higher price than it was here before it runs higher and you're going to buy or those individuals that have their stops they're going to buy the counterparty side of the smart money that wants to sell short because every buyer has to have a seller every seller has to have a buyer so that's what's occurring here but inside this shaded area i want to show you how this model is applicable here in fx so here's the four minute chart we were just looking at five so we start stripping down this price leg here and we're looking for any fair value gap do you see it pause the video look for it all right i'm about to show you this candle is low this candle is high there's your fair value cup isn't it interesting it just goes right up into there closes that in then and only then the market starts to aggressively run below the short term low here and then reaching into our objective down here at that 109 big figure now it doesn't quite get to 1.09 even but it does get to our fibonacci extension for the standard deviation it does get down to the old relative equal lows on the daily chart which is what that blue line is and look at the bodies respecting that level not much movement below it now for all of you raw dogs out there okay this is too much michael you're over complicating it you're confusing me michael you're talking about the midnight candle for the opening price and now you're talking about the 830 which one do i use why do i use it this that i don't think all right if you're gonna be trading fx you're gonna be using the 8 30 in the morning for new york session trades but refer to the new york open at midnight as well if the opening price is lower at the 830 than that of the opening price at midnight use the lower one reason why is you want to set the minimum threshold for a due to swing or market protraction to the upside when you're bearish and obviously everything that i just said would be reverse if you're bullish you'd be looking for a move below the opening at 8 30 to go long after it moves below it but we're focusing primarily on the shorting opportunity here in hindsight so that way you can get a better feel for how to use this model with fx so there's a subtle little group of nuances that you have to be aware of when you're looking at fx but it's not terribly you know harsh it's pretty easy to work with so we have the market trading above the opening price here market protraction due to swing it rallies up and then breaks down in here now this run here above the opening price does it have a fair value gap here's the four minute chart opening price now doesn't look the same because we're looking at a four-minute chart so it was anchored on a five-minute chart it rallies up you break lower fair value got right there trades up into it hammers it beautifully and then displacement trades lower down into that 109. was it one point zero nine zero one something or other i can't remember i thought i had but it hit it and i think the low of the day was 1.0901 so not bad i mean it's pretty close to perfect right but by itself you don't want to try to aim for just that level okay because that's the best exit strategy you don't want to do that you want to fluff up your exits with a couple pips i like to teach my students three to five pips and if you're thinking a target is going to be like for instance we'll say 1.0900 level okay if that's what you think it's going to trade to put your limit order to cover your shorts if you're short at 1.0905 okay you're not going to get the best exit that way but you have a spread that you have to incorporate when you're working with 4x and fx pairs sometimes and i've had a lot of this happen over the years as a fx trader where my limit order was a little too overzealous i was trying to be a little too perfect and i've had many amazing exits elude me because of my overzealous targeting so be a little bit more forgiving when you're trading especially 4x you got to incorporate the spread and i know some of you have brokers where it's like oh i have a really tight spread let me tell you something every broker has the ability to open that spread up on you you're seeing the best case scenario when that ticker is showing but trust me when it's advantageous for them they'll work it in their behalf not yours so make it easier for yourself just fluff up your excess with five pips okay and if you're really new just use 10 pips okay and if you're struggling with the idea that oh i don't want to do that i'll give up 10 pips well let me show you this would be your entry candle trading right back to this old high here so one pit bat or thereabouts once it hits that candle with this run here that right there would be your entry candle your stop would be right above this candle's high now if you're scared or whatever you can use this swing high and that's fine now in terms of math the entry price would be 1.096 and your stop would be 1.09728 hypothetically that's not a lot of pips i would generally round that to 10. even though it's not technically 10 pips here i would round it to 10 and just be done with it and looking at that model here and you're aiming for that essentially the 1.09 big figure fluffing it up a little bit so our exit price would be a little bit higher than that you guys see these things all the time and i just feel like using it you know just because i want to be cool the risk is here entry to stop and the distribution to your target down here risk to reward ratio better than eight to one and using a hypothetical 100 000 demo account if you're doing one of those funded account challenges or whatever in this trade here this gives you basically what you're looking for in one trade so i don't know if this scratches the issue for you but the stuff works in forex it works in index trading so it's a matter of adjusting to what it is you're trying to trade and then there's a little bit of rule following that you have to know when it comes to index trading and fx fx predominantly you're working with seven o'clock in the morning to ten o'clock in the morning that's your new york open kill zone okay index trading i'm focusing on 8 30 to 11 and i can take a trade all the way up to 10 40 10 45 and still be okay i'm not interested in taking new trades generally after 10 o'clock in the morning in the fx pair unless there is a news driver like we had this morning with the isem number the pmi number i mentioned earlier in the video so that was allowing me to be a little bit more forgiving with expectations for price you may not want to trade high impact news drivers and that's understandable if you don't know what you're doing but don't be afraid of them now with the economic counter having that high impact news driver at 10 o'clock that extends the new york session kill zone into the 11 11 30 time window because the volatility that it will bring in now i didn't take this trade i haven't taken any fx pair trades at all not for 2022 at least but if you're looking at a model that works in index futures you're looking at that 8 30 to 11 o'clock window and if you're trying to apply this model to fx it's seven o'clock in the morning to 10 o'clock in the morning now the high impact news drivers that come out after 10 o'clock like for instance if you're a canadian dollar trader and the crude oil inventory number comes out usually like 10 30 in the morning you have to make allowances for that and just expect there'd be a likely move on that oil number at 10 30. so just something to throw out there i know a lot of you been barking wanting to see something fx related because you know predominantly i've been doing that since 2010 but i humbly submit this for your inquiry and that way you can study this and listen to it a few times it has a couple things in there that mia went over your head it's not terribly you know demanding in terms of note-taking but there's some things in here that are noteworthy for you to have in your study journal and for the most part it looks like it works pretty good in this pair too or in this asset class so until i talk to you again on thursday be safe

all right folks welcome back this is episode 18 of the continuing series of the ict 2022 youtube mentorship all right so we are looking at the euro dollar and what you have here is how i have my trade layout this is what i work with while utilizing my charts through trading view and don't be intimidated because you may not be able to do this with your trading view uh there's a i think there's a membership level you have to have and again i'm not trying to promote i don't get anything for you signing up with tradingview i don't have any affiliate programs nothing like that i don't have any you know programs that i'm trying to pitch i just like the service okay i pay for it out of my pocket you don't have to owe me any favors so but i have it set up like this when i'm looking at the marketplace the upper left hand corner now you you can do this with individual charts and you'll see what i mean by having one laptop one screen if you do what i'm going to show you here today you don't need all these screens but i've been asked to show this both in my private group and in the youtube community what do my charts look like when i'm going through the motions of looking for trade setups and how do i navigate from higher time frame down to the lower time frame and how do i work with daily bias and what do i do with my charts to streamline the analysis from high time frame to low time frame i'm going to show you that in this lesson here all right so upper left-hand corner is always going to be the daily chart as you can see here daily now if you're looking for bias you're going to start your analysis here now you can do it with the chart maximize like this start working with it doing all of the business that you would expect to have in your chart and we'll do this here shout out to my mentorship group private group i mentioned this on wednesday's midweek commentary a little bit of hindsight done right so we have fair value gap there and notice that it has this high that low and a higher high many of you would see that as my bearish breaker it's not okay so look at this here which is lower is it this low here or the discount low of the fair value gap in other words this candle is high clearly it's this candle's high so i'm going to tell you something i told my private group last night because i can tell it to you now it's not advantageous to you it was advantageous for them because they knew about it yesterday but i'm showing you this because i have a lot of witnesses that i said this before it happened because i know some of you out here unless you were there watching it okay you just simply won't believe it and that's fine i'm not here to convince every single one of you you're either going to believe it or you're going to watch somebody else's channel as simple as that but the fair value gap in here i mentioned that we would likely draw up into that and then look for lower prices now let's step by step walk through a scenario using what i'm teaching you in this mentorship on the youtube channel okay i responded to a lady on the comment section of i think it was the most recent video so forgive me if it isn't that video but i know i mentioned uh a response to her question was more or less i'm gonna paraphrase it can i touch on or teach a specific approach to trading or can i mention rather a specific style of trading that if i only had to pick one way of doing it one style of trading that obviously hits all the time well there is no method that hits every single time okay everything that i trade with and teach is like everything else it's imperfect that means there's going to be losing transactions largely because of the operator me or whoever else is using it and you have to take ownership of that it takes a great deal of responsibility and i kind of lectured on that in my private group on wednesday it doesn't feel good to hear those types of woodshed lectures but it's something i needed when i was younger but if i was going to use one particular approach to trading like say i was starting completely over didn't know anything but i discovered like say this youtube channel knowing what i know about all the things that i can utilize in trading the reason why i stripped it all down and created the model like it is and you're going to see more of it being applied here today so it gives you like a a step-by-step approach i know some of you were asking can you just kind of like show me what it is i'm trying to do in the charts like what am i looking for what's what's a way of back testing you know how can i go through and look at old data i'm going to show you something here but it was also given to my community yesterday okay and if i see a bunch of comments in the comment section saying that it wasn't really done i'll just simply upload the video and prove everybody that says that wrong so i'm ready i'm ready for it so the long short is it's not a big deal it's not a huge trade but it's proving prognostication it's proving that number one i've already hinted that this thing was likely to go lower anyway and we've seen it go lower but utilizing the model this model here in the youtube 2022 mentorship that to me is the easiest and i would just do this i wouldn't worry about doing anything with like uh central bank dealer's range okay i wouldn't worry about doing anything with asian range i wouldn't even worry about doing anything with the well there's a anything else unless i've mentioned it in this model i wouldn't even do any investment of time at all because this literally is the simplest way to work with intraday and daily order flow it's simple it really is this simple it doesn't feel sexy though i know some of you young guys are like yeah but wait till he starts bringing out all the really hard-hitting you know gadgets and such you're going to be floored by that no you don't need it i don't want my daughter inundated with all that stuff number one she's really not interested in trading so i'm trying to convince her that she can do this with something it's very simple it's streamlined so what does that mean by streamlining it and what is the step-by-step process because i already told you the bias i've had on this currency when i taught one tuesday i gave you a 4x lesson i showed you an example with the euro i said it's likely to draw into this low here now here's the wonderful thing we don't even need it to go down to that low to find profitability how's that how is that possible how are you able to responsibly handle daily bias work with a higher time frame and then frame out a setup using the logic that i'm showing you in this model let's do that now number one the bias is bearish so if a bearish bias is being implemented okay in other words you're using that in your analysis you're going through the charts looking for setups that would warrant a short sale on this particular market or this pair in forex what i'm showing you here all of this up to now if i make a transition to index futures trading i'll mention certain caveats when it comes to that but for now everything i'm saying in this video until i say otherwise is pertinent to forex okay so it's specific to 4x all right so bias is bearish and we're looking at a daily chart so you start your analysis there you have a fair value gap here so it can trade up into that and all you have to see is that candle traded to there now you can be greedy and try to trade all the way up into the middle point or deep into it maybe in complete closure i don't need that and we're gonna bring in the element of time of day and how that helps you decide what you're looking for and you don't really need to catch that high today either so i'm going to show you how to be forgiving with your entries the important thing is knowing what you're looking for ahead of time so that way you're not changing gears back and forth intraday chasing an impulsive price swing that may feel like oh i'm probably wrong let me chase this let me chase that when i showed the three months live trading account statements what some of you are not listening to when i say it in the video listen to the videos okay when i'm showing those statements i'm disclosing the fact that i'm getting questions by my students these folks have paid me okay they asked for me to show them things in a live account you are not privy to all of those conversations because you're not in that community so when they're asking me questions like what do you do if you get this this and this and this how would you work with that in in a real market i'm literally putting myself in a live account creating those very sim similar situations that they're asking me about and then moving out of those periods of either drawdown or how to overcome the anxious i don't want to take a trade i'm scared what happens if you take losing trades how do you overcome that a lot of those executions you're seeing is just simply me pushing a button to show that yes you can do those types of things to overcome initial fear it's going to cost you commission it's going to look like you have no idea what you're doing and there's people out there looking at these statements i've encouraged all of you to do it but it isn't going to mean anything to you unless you understand what i'm really illustrating there you're not the student that was spoken to in private with that live account showing that actual event unfolding so just know that there's a lot of things that are going on that are not necessarily your business okay the community here wanted to see a live account you see it on live account but working within a live account unless you do things like i'm going to show you here you're going to have this changing of direction intraday over and back and forth back and forth you're going to go up you're going to go down you're going to go back and forth and then it's gonna draw your account down or worse if you don't control yourself you'll blow the account so you have to commit to one direction that's your bias here's the thing your bias isn't going to be perfect and here's a news flash for you you as well i'm not always perfect with my bias either a bias is just an idea that you want to work within and employ your short sale when you're bearish or employ your long trade ideas when you're bullish and you're filtering out the other side of the marketplace unless you're proven clearly that you're absolutely wrong you just simply wait for these setups to form with that bias in mind now i know a lot of you are new and you want to see things taught to you that simply remove any chance of you losing there is no secret for that here nobody's going to teach that to you because it doesn't exist and frankly if someone had that i'll be real honest with you folks if i had a way that i would never lose i would have never came out publicly and became a teacher i would be the richest person you've ever met that's the god's honest truth that's exactly what would happen and if there's somebody out there that has some kind of a means of never losing they're doing that very thing they're never gonna talk about it they're never gonna teach it so you don't need to be perfect and i've proven imperfection still doubles the account it's simple and you can have a lot of losing trades and this is one of the things that one of my students asked they said what if your win rate is really really low can you still double an account yes because i was thumbing my nose at this idea that a risk to reward model is the essential for you to be net profitable that's not true i've proven that with a live account i have lots of things i'm going to show you with this td ameritrade account before the end of the year but just know that they're they're future lessons that i'm going to literally go through and show you not everything obviously because you're not i'm not obligated to show you everything that the other community is entitled to but i don't need to show you everything to see that account growing now the question is is what do you do if you're in a live account let's let's paint a picture for you okay say you're one of those individuals out there that have got caught up in the fever of all these funded account programs okay i'm not going to name any in particular because i don't have an affiliation with one i don't want an affiliation with any of them and i don't have any personal experience with my own trading with any of them okay so that way we know i'm not repping anyone there's no inside you know kickback for me none of that stuff but there's a number of them out there and my opinion of them is i have students that have gone through them and they are funded do i believe everyone should do that i don't personally believe everyone should uh but it is an avenue that you have to consider when you're in your own seat if you want to do that or not but let's assume that you've gone through the process and now you have passed whatever that you know i guess the challenge or whatever they call it to get funded and you found yourself with a let's say a hundred thousand dollar account in other words you have the ability to trade with what would be considered a hundred thousand dollars what process if it were me doing that okay that's i'm gonna speak in that perspective now i'm not saying you should do this notice what i'm saying here if it were me and i was starting out all over again i would use this model and i would go through the process of what i'm going to show you right now okay so bearish uh daily bias and i'm going through the daily chart and i'm looking at recent price action so we had this big drop down here drawing towards this low and then the next day we had this candle trade up here so that creates the fair value got so ideally you know what we've seen here we had one two three four five down days now there's likely to have a retracement because we've seen it come way down in terms of the range between this low and this high so what does that make that area down here premium or discount discount so as soon as this fair value gap forms we know that it's likely to see it rally up into this area here you know there's a short term little bounce that occurring and trading back to this candle's high is enough to set the stage for a new round of selling so you highlight your area on your daily chart and then look at what we have in terms of targets this is an ideal scenario that low but it's not likely to do that in one day can it do it absolutely but look at what is available in terms of targeting this day here it created the fair value gap so that means we can go in and note that low right there and we'll change it to blue here okay and we're going to put a little line segment here on this daily candle and we'll mark that one red okay so we have more or less a premium level that's being highlighted you can see it touches it but it actually goes above it just a little bit and that's all we'll need to justify a framework okay now let me recap real quick bearish bias we're likely to draw down to this low here why because we had one two three times like i mentioned on the video on tuesday or episode 17 if i'm not mistaken in this mentorship so it's likely to draw lower and dig into this low that's our draw on liquidity on the daily chart but is that your trade target no not for intraday trading so you frame your daily highs and lows previous daily high previous daily low so we have this day here you know yesterday's trading or what would be considered wednesday's trading and then thursday's trading we opened here we rallied up popped just above that short-term high and now because we've seen that we can target that daily low right here okay so this is the trading day on thursday we open rally up create a judas swing run back into this fair value gap and then expect it to sell off and then we can aim for that daily low why because anybody that went long in here who would want to do that there's always buyers and sellers okay so we're going to use previous days highs and lows like institutional mindset traders do there's lots of liquidity around daily highs and lows and high frequency trading algorithms attack previous day's highs and lows if you were back in the baby pitch days when i came in the scene 2009 2010 that was the first lesson i started talking about is highlight the previous day's highs and lows and do that for the last three days if you do that you'll see a plethora of setups that you can do and that gives you liquidity pools that you can attack you there's always a fresh supply of new setups if you're looking at the last three days highs and lows it's always the case it's always going to be there you're never going to run out of trades ever okay so we have our framework here we have the actually let me change this blue to that green okay so we have premium and discount so these two levels are represented on the high and low of wednesday's trading which would be yesterday straight in other words your chart would have looked like this wednesday going into thursday before thursday started trading you'd have this so you would not mark your chart out like this so if we go up here and we enter this fair value gap that's your opportunity to go in looking for shorts then if it starts to go down you're targeting this low with the expectation why is it likely to do that because it may want to go down to this low but this gives you a nice range of profitability potential profitability so a range of we'll just call that 935 to a low of what is it what's the low here 74. so 25 6 we'll call it 60 60 handles okay not bad that's a pretty respectable range can you get 25 pips out of that can you get 30 pips out of that how about 40 pips well we're gonna find out but this is the range of opportunity that exists looking at wednesday's trading and then thursday we open we rally up we bump that high like we would expect trading back into that fair value gap and then we watch price does it give us a setup what set up what i've taught you in this mentorship so we're going to drop down into the lower time frame if you have this layout like this so whatever you do in one chart it would appear in all the other time frames which is really nice this is one of the things that i'd like to use in trading view not that tradingview is the only platform because obviously you can do this with everything out there today but it's just really nice to be able to do this with all my students they can do the same thing but if you're working with one screen like a laptop and i'll answer this while i'm talking about it should you be trading on your phone no no you shouldn't can you manage a trade on your phone yes but entering a brand new position on your phone no you don't see enough data it's just too compressed and you need to be able to see the lay of the land okay you need to be able to open your chart up and really take in the information if you don't do that folks you're really just looking at a small little small little perspective really if you want to have advantages you you do it with a computer screen okay if you want to be handicapped then obviously try to trade on your phone okay i have not met anyone that has been consistently profitable and trading millions of dollars and they trade on their phone it just it doesn't work like that folks you got to be responsible you have to have some real estate and yes it requires a little bit of an investment but hey you don't need all kinds of things you don't need all the screens like i have and other people i have out there i'm showing you how you can do this at one screen one monitor so what would that look like obviously you can see everything i did on the daily chart is transposed onto the hourly chart down here in the lower left hand corner and it's transposed over here to the 15 minute time frame so time frames our upper left is daily lower left is hourly and 15 minute time frame is only right the 15 minute time frame is my bellwether chart that's the one that i go to quickly i want to keep referencing that 15 minute time frame throughout the day because the information i get from it which i'm going to show you is influential to me in terms of managing my position or hunting or stalking a new trade setup and also it helps me trust my intraday bias and i'll i'll explain that when we get into that specific time frame but let me go back for a second to the daily because i want to bring something up if you're using one screen okay you would obviously do this annotation here and then in this screen you would just simply change it to the hourly chart and then everything you did here would be transposed over to the trading view chart that would be on the hourly chart rather and then once you've done whatever breakdown and markups that you would have for your hourly chart then you would drop down to the 15 minute timeframe and all of the annotations from the daily and the hourly would appear on your 15-minute chart as you'll see okay so let's go back to the layout and i'm going to maximize the hourly chart all right so i like to do these types of things bring it to the actual level i'm anchoring to because i have obsessive compulsive disorder so it is what it is it's a struggle folks so in here it's this imbalance on the daily chart but now we can see it also exists in the hourly as well so we have what this high and this high what are they they're relative equal highs anchored to that point right there okay so usually in my annotations i'm going into the chart and this is for the purposes of showing you how to back test and how you annotate your chart you toggle it to show on the top left and you can use whatever color you want and there you go so we had the annotations that would be on your chart for logging purposes for your study journal and then you would just screenshot this okay you might want to zoom in a little bit you know make the chart a little bit more aesthetically pleasing having something like that more you know more information zoomed in to a specific area and then simply go in and start working with the 15 minute time frame because this is all i would do with the hourly chart because the frame of reference is that daily fair value gap we have liquidity pull on the hourly chart we've already mapped out the 6th of april's low notice there's no lower low this low didn't go down to it and we start a new day on the seventh here at midnight new york local time what do i mean by new york midnight i'm going to answer that let's go to the 15 minute time frame here and as you can see we already have that little annotation updated on the 15 minute time frame so now here's the 15 minute timing frame and i apologize for all of you that would otherwise know how to do this but obviously it's a mentorship right there's a lot of people in the comments section that are asking for these types of lessons and once i go through this this episode we won't ever have to revisit it again okay so bear with me okay all right so now we have on the 15 minute time frame we're going to annotate the daily dividers this all is a little vertical line okay and this little bar here is just my favorites bar and you can google that for setting that up these are the things i use most in trading view so when i expand the chart to maximize the full screen i highlight the little star button in the lower left hand corner just below the little link button if you click that link button any chart you have open that's the same symbol any all the annotations will be plotted and placed on all the time frames of that instrument or that pair or that market so in other words if like i was showing you with my trading layout upper left-hand corner daily hourly lower left hand and 15 minute time frame on the right it's the biggest chart hitting that little link button icon will again link all your charts together so whatever you're showing annotations on one time frame will appear on all of them that's how this is happening okay you can google that too and there's a lot of uh tips you can get off of youtube for a trading video most of my tips i actually got from my students which i appreciate because they're more fluent with this i came from mt4 and tradestation so i'm a work in progress with uh trading view so so you're gonna drop a vertical line here to delineate a new day at midnight what is the opening price at new york midnight that's this candle and you highlight that and this price right here that right there if you're looking at the time frame on the hourly that would be the opening price i'm interested in that on a 15 minute time frame or if i'm going to be scalping i'm going to use the five minute chart okay and i'll put two reference points on the five minute chart but for the sake of this discussion just know that that's the actual price i'm looking at and i'm drawing that out in time how far am i drawing it out 11 o'clock in the morning new york local time how do i know my charts gonna look like icts right that's what you're asking you toggle it to new york i don't care where you live i don't care where you're at in all the different time zones your trading view chart needs to be set to this if you do that your chart will match all the things i'm teaching and the things i'm teaching you to look for will be easier to find okay everything will be streamlined in terms of time of day all right so now we have the buy sell equity pull the daily denomination of midnight new york time and we're going to take a little line segment here and we're going to plot it right on here now i'm just going to just rough it because it's basically a little tiny indecisive candle i don't care the difference between the actual open and close it's very minute but i'm going to draw that on here and if you drag your your trend line over to the right if you hold down the shift button it'll keep your trend line straight okay just drop it there and i'll just make this a gray color here now you can annotate that but over time doing it you'll just know that that's what you're anchoring and showing this is the opening price at midnight okay now we have the relative equal highs here we rallied above them once it hits this do we get displacement now we get down to the nitty gritty okay we have a swing low here it breaks down below that and then once it does that does it create an imbalance is there a fair value gap hint nudge nudge you see that all right so we're going to annotate that so inside of this range here we have a fair value gap and i'm gonna highlight this we'll just use this color here now these are probably not the best colors you're probably cussing me right now saying why are you using these ugly colors ict that's something just to annoy you so that way you can get more attentive and pay attention because this is a long video already so we're looking at the market wanting to go higher first to go lower and here's that midnight delineation starting a new day we rally up and then we break down so what's the model teach trading when the new york session okay so we're trading the new york session in 4x it's seven o'clock in the morning to ten o'clock in the morning right there okay so ten o'clock in the morning and seven o'clock so we're looking for a setup that would be formed within that time frame now you can create killzone windows annotations on your chart there's lots of ways i've done this over the years you can do it whatever way you want to do it inside center and we'll make it black and [Music] there you go so the new york kill zone it runs up into that runs the highs and we want to see a displacement to the downside we get it right there okay so now you have this area here and then you would put your order in right there what time is that it's 10 o'clock so you put your limit order in to sell short right at that price right there or plus one pip period and your risk is going to be above this high the imbalance is really stretched out you can use that as your stop if you're really concerned you can put your stop above the swing high but whenever you have a big range like that my stop can place right there so your stop would be here and you're going to go short here that's the minimum expectation using the 15 minute timing frame but we're going to split the 15 minute time frame down into five-minute intervals okay so we're gonna look inside this range here and see if it's advantageous for us to go down into a five-minute chart and does it have a fair value gap in that all right so we're looking at the five-minute chart now and it's that shaded area here so it's using this specific candle or that low and we're looking inside this range right here okay so it's this decline we're looking at does it have fair value gap well we have this small one right in here see that we have this stretched out one here yes and then we have all this running here where it has a small little fair value got so now think about what's been shown on that 15 minute time frame we have a minimum threshold of at least reaching into this low okay remember i showed you on the 50 minute timeframe that inbounds so it needs to get up into that okay so i'm answering the question that i saw or it really wasn't a question it was someone trying to make a point that was i showing something incorrectly by showing a higher time frame fair value gap because wouldn't the smaller time frame fair value got formed before the higher timing frame no it never works like that the higher time frame imbalances are going to be parent to the subordinate smaller time frames okay the parent okay is this 15 minute time frame imbalance so it needs to get above that but when it does that we have to look at the lower time frame below 15 minute time frame which is the beginning stages of our fine-tuned entry of five four three two and one time frames so here we have the five-minute chart we have an imbalance right here and then we have that smaller one right in here and all the way up to this price point here we could factor that in but it's not likely to get up there so we can look at what this level here that is the minimum expectation you can put a cell limit order there to go short or you can fine-tune this to rebalance all up to here right there in other words it would look like this this would be your imbalance on the five-minute chart and if it traded up into that right there okay you know what you could use any tank any specific price in this range here you can pick this is where the unique style for you comes in if you get greedy you may not get your fill so i'm teaching you the low threshold entry but that always will give you the highest risk but that higher risk in terms of number of pips not in terms of the amount of money because that part is always controlled by you the trader you can manage the amount of leverage you're using and it doesn't matter how many pips of risk you have the amount of allocation in terms of the leverage that you're using in the trade that's the most important thing and that's the most important thing that gets abused most of the time by traders because every time a trader gets in the marketplace their expectations are how can i make the most and they don't necessarily think about the other side of that sword because if the edge you're trying to chop with okay or swing if it makes contact with with your target then yes you are profitable but if it comes back and hits you in the head okay you're burying that axe right in your skull so that leverage is going to be counterproductive to you it's going to hurt you at that point it's not going to be beneficial to you it's going to harm you so i'm teaching you the low threshold entry but i'm also teaching you in addition to that i'm showing you how to build an additional perspective that helps you find the better entries that allows you to shorten the number of pips or points if you're trading with the index futures okay but long story short this would be your range you can work within and it trades up into that secondary fair value gap now some of you might say well what happens if i put a limit up here well that would be obviously a stellar entry but you don't necessarily need that okay why i like this one is because if you look at the 15 minute time frame it was like this that was the range okay so if we go up in that range to the upper end of it look over here what do we have all three of these candles here one two three the order block begins with this candle's low it's one two three candles making one consecutive bearish order block some of you are commenting in the section of the video saying i thought i understood order blocks now i'm confused because you're hearing people parrot what i've said in certain circumstances and they don't understand what an order block is okay this is why i get upset when people try to teach what they heard me teach about one or two times and the buzzword is what's being tossed around so that way people can sell their courses and get clicks on their videos you have no idea learning about order blocks from anybody else on youtube i'm gonna make it very plain and make a blanket statement right there i'm not trying to hurt anybody's feelings i know a lot of you out there that try to talk about order blocks you have a lot of respect for me but i'm trying to correct you because i know you have a large audience and some of you have a very large audience and you're doing things that are not accurate okay so i know you're watching my videos that way you'll correct what you're doing so that way your viewers won't be harmed or they won't use something that's done incorrectly and dubbed as my order block and if they have hardship or difficulty doing it it's not going to be a tribute to the concepts being affected because they are effective it's just they haven't been taught properly okay it's easy to talk about in hindsight but it's real hard to do it in real time unless you know what you're doing so the logic is we we ran up into this daily fair value gap that's what this level is up here this red line was does relative equal highs on the hourly chart remember that and you're probably going to need to watch this video a few times because i've gone through a lot already but i'm breaking down the market and this run here is the run into that imbalance and above the relative equal highs so this is the bearish order block it's the consecutive run on this time frame the five minute chart it does not need to get up into this last up closed candle before the down close because that's what everybody says in order block is it is not that notice it doesn't even get up to that does it why because what i'm showing you here what makes an order block valid it has to have an imbalance without the imbalance there is no order block that's why it's not supply and demand okay there are specific rules i'm going to cut through candles supply and demand requires fresh zones okay that's nonsense i have no affinity for anything like that i'll cut through fractals and go through and find something over here and still trade on it so it violates the supply and demand theory right there so i that's the distinction and why i laugh at people that say oh he's teaching really nothing new i'm really teaching you something that no one's talking about unless i talk about it first they're saying what i said and not to sound egotistical i'm not trying to be egotistical but i i want you to learn it correctly folks okay i only want to see you do it the right way because if you do it the right way you will find the results you're looking for if you don't want to do what i'm teaching you're not going to be consistent you're not going to find longevity and you're going to get frustrated and you're going to think that this stuff doesn't work because you didn't learn it properly from the person that created it the order block is all three consecutive candles the reason why this last up close candle is not even traded to is because the higher time frame parent imbalance that 15 minute time frame which is being shown here that range of that low and that candle is high here it stops there so there's no necessity for it to trade up into that last candle so if it trades up into this candle here the bottom one the last one of the three going up that's enough for me and take that over here and then we have this inbound so in my mind this imbalance is sufficient we don't need this one and you wouldn't expect that last up close cam to be traded too so this is the ideal scenario that i think the mentorship on youtube should be looking for now as soon as you have this this is one you settle in on what are you met with another little fair value got right above it so what were the rules that i gave you when it has that in the chart think it is going to be a likelihood that it could trade up in there but your limit order to enter is down in here because it might not get up here what am i trying to do i'm trying to teach you how to avoid missing trades because a lot of you're going to want to put an order up in here and yes it would have been filled on this instance but many times you're going to have an order placed at a really overzealous price point that if you nail it it's beautiful but they don't happen a lot it's fleeting it happens once in a while so i'm trying to give you something that allows you to operate consistently gives you lots of setups that will allow you to practice also back test like i'm showing you here this is how you back test because this has already happened but these are all the things that i'm teaching in this mentorship and i've talked about this level here in my own private group beforehand and you also knew about the bias being bearish on this pair from tuesday's trading or tuesday's episode in this mentorship on the youtube channel okay so we have a break in this low here so there's an internal shift in market structure it's bearish we have the imbalance here that's been refined down into the five-minute chart in concert with the bearish order block the lowest down closed candle we've talked about why we're not looking at the last closed candle before the down move so we're cancelling all that misconception and it runs up into the level with the rule i gave you if we settle in on a fair value gap and it has a small one above it expected it might trade up there so your risk has to incorporate that so that's the reason why i'm telling you your stop-loss could be here yes it might be a little bit too rich for some of you because you want to trade with one pip stop loss a half a pip stop loss there's a lot of guys out there trying to do ultra ultra short term stuff you might be able to pull it off once in a while maybe you know a series of trades but i promise you when you start putting down size on these trades you're not going to pull that off okay it just isn't going to happen so don't get used to trying to do it okay plus it's easy to do other things you can walk away from the charts and not be chained to it because if you have a small ultra short stop i don't care how good you are you're gonna sweat it you're gonna be expecting you're gonna get stopped out what happens if it stops me out i'm not worrying about getting stopped out i'm not worried about if the market moves to my stop i'm more interested in the market moving where i think it's going to go where is that that's this level down here that's the sixth of april's low okay yeah we went lower than that already here let me get this thing out of your way if you take this and move out of the way here we have the an early run at uh five o'clock or so in the morning it made that at 5 25 new york local time in the morning it swept the previous days low so the 6th of april was swept then we rallied up and we hit the level that what our bias called for in other words i'm looking for this level to be traded to before i go short so i'm not taking anything in london i'm not worried about anything in london because london didn't give me the initial rally higher into this area when does it go up here it's going up there at 9 30 in the morning new york local time so it hits that level it's at a really rich premium and i know my discount level i'm looking for for targeting so here's the framework the setup we have our market structure shift disqualified all these upper candles here the lower candle that's where you're going to aim for what's the order block that you trade for michael what's the one what's the right order block how do i pick the right order block i just answered it what is an order block it's a change in the state of delivery the algorithm changes its state of delivery as soon as we get below this candle's open the market starts delivering sell side and then it breaks this swing low so now we have changed gears internally any rally after that is just setting up another run to go lower so in other words this is a suspect rally okay so this is an intermediate term high swing high because it has the imbalance it should not trade higher than that high that's the reason why i'm telling you you can put your stop loss there see how the rules are coming together i'm not complicating it i'm literally telling you everything i've taught and i'm putting it into the chart everything was said before it happened and here it is it's the framework it's the logic and i'm teaching you with the great detail that you otherwise would have never learned so i'm taking you in over top the chart giving you the framework and giving you the logic i'm giving you the what if this what if that conditions okay i'm telling you how to negate certain order blocks that you would otherwise expect to see it trade to because of different youtube channels or other people trying to teach my stuff and they don't know what they're talking about okay they have no idea what they're doing this setup here gives us a nice opportunity to get short so you could be a seller here on a limit entry so you place your limit order here and you just walk away from it you let it go now what happens if it doesn't fill you by 11 30 pull the order that's it don't put it you know good till cancel just pull it because you want to be entering on the day that it creates this because relative equal highs if it doesn't drop off it could come up in a time of day where you won't really want to be there and it could fill you and then keep on running and take out the relative equal highs at a deeper pass and then stop you out so it's important to know why the kill zones are there kill zones are when you determine your entry and you place your orders and you walk away you don't need to have your entry filled inside that kill zone window your order idea and your order placement needs to be considered at that time if you can't derive a order placement for setup or trade entry by that time you have nothing to do and that's it you've basically taken no risk on and you have to wait to the next trading opportunity or trading day and the market obviously starts to break lower and then trades to it here at 245. so at 245 it fills it and that's the end of that so not bad it's 10 20 30 40 pips so there you go 40 pips you don't get the very highest high and it ultimately goes a little bit lower who cares you you've structured a trade that makes sense and it's just a really nice run up in there and everything's delivered on the basis of the logic and the elements i'm teaching you in this youtube channel and you can't argue with it it's it's obvious it's so plain to see how these markets are being delivered and if you're one that likes to argue and say there is an algorithm or if you say that these concepts don't work and all that stuff it's because you want some excuse why you can't do it yourself and i don't want any of you to feel that way okay i don't get a high or you know get my rocks off because people stumble and not do well with this because i know why they're not doing well you're not doing the work that's required that means going through your charts and doing what i just did here every single day and being passionate about it looking at what it is that has been shown in price action what is it doing what is it not doing the things i've taught you in this lesson tonight is in my mind it's charter level teaching it literally is something that i would generally reserve for charter members only that means the people that have been with me for a year or more and they're under my tutelage in my private community so this is a lesson that literally would come from that type of student level but i'm applying it to what you're learning with this model it's applicable to forex it's applicable to bonds it's applicable to gold it's applicable but let me put this because i see a lot of people also saying can you show it in gold gold is one of those markets that is an event driven market okay and what that means is it usually requires some kind of geopolitical or something crazy causing it to move otherwise it's highly manipulated there's a lot of stop hunts and then consolidations it's very frustrating okay it's it's not a it's not a market i believe that someone should be aggressively short-term trading i don't think that's the ideal market there's plenty other markets out there that you can do that with and have better you know consistency and longevity now am i saying there aren't people out there that are making money consistently in gold no i'm not saying that i'm saying because i'm speaking to people with the expectation that you're just now learning how to do this i'm aware that there's a lot of you that are veterans that have been trading longer than the average person coming to my youtube channel but i have to speak in a language that is palatable for a new viewer otherwise i'm gonna speak to and this might be too lofty for a new viewer anyway but it hopefully it will intrigue them to see that there's a rhyming reason to everything i'm teaching and they repeat it keeps happening every single day these signatures repeat so the question is going to be is what are you going to do with this information are you going to just say okay well this is great but this is too much work so i'm going to look for something else that gives me a moving average crossover or some kind of a bell and whistle to put things on my chart to tell me what to do and then you're basically creating a religious trading style because you're trusting something other than price because what have i shown you here just price there's no indicators here i'm only putting these areas in here with this rectangle to highlight an imbalance i don't have these on my chart in time you won't either but in the beginning while you're learning it's important to annotate your chart so that when you log them in your study journal that way at the end of the week you go back and look at all the intraday price action then you look at how the weekly chart worked within that whole panoramic view of intraday daily price action how did it all fit together and by doing that you're literally getting snapshots of every individual day then the daily chart in the weekly chart and how it fulfilled its entire weekly range when was the high for when was the low formed what was the biggest day of the week what was the framework around that biggest day of the week of movement and then also breakdown obviously like we're showing you here where trade setups it doesn't make a difference if you didn't trade it everything anybody ever learns is always done by hindsight you want to be a doctor a surgeon guess what you're doing you're working in hindsight you're studying medical journals that about things that took place that you were not there okay you're studying hindsight don't let these goobers out there try to discourage you from studying because i'm teaching you how you are going to get better at this you do what i just showed you how to do right here and you do it every single day you're going to develop your own style of keeping notes in your charts i'm not going to do that here because i don't want to make a an example and feel like you have to do exactly what i said okay what do i mean by that it's to me it's fascinating to see people comment in the comment section of the videos or they'll send me an email or i'll listen to people that obviously are trained under me and they make videos on youtube i can hear my fingerprints or read my fingerprints in the way they talk they'll say certain things certain words certain expressions i can i can see my own fingerprints on that this part i always leave empty and i do the same way of teaching even in a private group because i never show them annotations outside of the things i'm showing because over here you might write an observation about something that you may want to further investigate that i might not even touch on in this discussion or lecture but it's important to you so you use the space in your chart to write those things down and then you come back to that chart on saturday at the end of the week or sunday if that's the day you're going to do it on and you revisit the entire week and you walk through the entire week of how it delivered how many pips did it move and how much risk would have been incurred in the trade so all those things work towards a model that you'll grow accustomed to trusting because you'll have back data and you'll have examples that you've trained yourself to see over time and by doing this your psychological makeup as a trader will be formed with these things in mind so that way when you're watching price action it'll leap off at the chart when it's forming and you'll remember something you saw hundreds or thousands of times before that generally repeat over and over and over again does every single day look exactly like this no but there's a lot of similarity to the things i'm showing you here that repeat so it's it's a matter of knowing what you're looking for if two bears are walking in the snow one's younger and one's older and they're walking in the snow will both footprints look exactly the same no but you'll recognize they're both bear prints and you'll recognize which one's larger or older and which one's younger so that's what it's like when you're looking at these signatures and price action they are generally very close to one another in terms of repeating the same type of way but they're not going to be so identical that they're indistinguishable to the next one like you'll be able to see that that's a different day of trading but you'll still recognize these repeating phenomenon that is so telling in the marketplace but you can't fully appreciate it right now because you're only now just becoming introduced to it and maybe you've watched some of my videos maybe you watched all my videos and you see when i do this and it resonates with you you're like man i can i get it because he's showing it to me but then you go out into the chart and you try to do it and it just feels like your chart doesn't is organized or it's not so obvious to you what you're looking for that's normal that's how it was for me for a long time in the 90s for a long time i struggled and floundered of trying to figure out what i'm supposed to be looking for i'm teaching you the things that repeat your job is to keep going into the chart annotating them and keeping a a running log a study journal of what the price action has done and what you're observing you can't get hurt because it's already happened the moves already happened so you're studying it so what you're creating is the greatest technical analysis book that you're ever going to own and you're doing it in your own words with your own work because when you buy a book what are you getting you're getting snapshots of something they're saying this is the important thing about this particular chapter or the theme of this particular book i'm showing you how you need to stop buying books there is no books out there except for the ones i put in that one video that's in my library honestly that's it no other books are necessary in trading in my opinion it's just it's the same garbage that's repeated and rehashed and people are just trying to do a cash grab you're not going to learn anything except for bad habits and flawed logic now when you've created a study journal with thousands of examples and you've been doing it for years you're going to be astonished of how much of a technical analyst you are years from now and you'll be able to see a lot more setups that you just don't see like there's several opportunities in this time frame or this fractal here on a five-minute chart there's lots of little trades in here i'm not going to go through and pick them all out because this is going to create a thousand different questions and you're going to miss or overlook the very thing i've shown you in this lecture but this is a model that obviously works in this time frame in this pair it's in 4x it's not highly specific only two futures notice that it's pretty clear isn't it it may not have been clear before i walked through it with you but you learned hopefully a great deal of things tonight you learned a little bit about quarter blocks what makes an order block based on the fair value gap how do you differentiate how you look at the order block how do you break it down how do you invalidate the certain parts of the order block how do you know it's not going to go in the upper half of the order block or the last up closed candle before it goes down i taught that tonight so hopefully this has been insightful to you and obviously we'll be back again next tuesday until i talk to you then enjoy your weekend and be safe

all right folks welcome back a little bit of a different type of presentation style tonight i'm gonna be blending both of my communities okay i have a private mentorship group which i usually do a midweek review and commentary and teaching with on wednesday monday and friday and then obviously you know youtube mentorship group you all get a video from me on tuesday night and on thursday night well this is part of the video when i talk to my private group i do a little bit of jaw boning so bear with me because i'm trying to save myself a lot of time i went on holiday last week and we went down to florida did some gum shoe detective work found some interesting things and i'll bring that up in the coming weeks it'll be a little interesting but in the meantime i came back obviously late we had a lot of traffic and it delayed me i couldn't get back home to do the video for the youtube community and i got home late today and i had a lot of admin tasks to do because of mentorship and businesses that i'm running so with that said just know that this is not going to be a regular thing i'm doing it because i have a lot of work to do when i'm producing these videos for my private group so i am blending both okay so i'm gonna cover what i promised i was gonna cover in the youtube commentary on tuesday night but was unable to do so and then also i'm gonna give the private mentorship group their commentary and blend both communities together okay so it'll kind of give you a little bit of a an appreciation for just how much i really am teaching here on youtube okay and just so you know i know there's a lot of you that are commenting in the videos and you're asking how to join the private mentorship group and what is the distinction between that and the youtube community well the private mentorship group they get to see things before it happens okay and as i call moves before it happens i call analysis i break that down before it happens and i'll give you a little taste of that what was given to them on monday night and i'll use that to segue into the teaching that i promised i would give you youtube community on tuesday night but was unable to and kind of give you also a a preview kind of like what i'm going to be doing when i start doing live streams what do you say i see he's going to be doing live streams he said he said he was going to do live streams didn't they say he would never do that yep it's 2022 i'm doing everything they said i wouldn't do okay so anyway the point is i'm going to give you a little bit of a taste of what i'm going to be outlining in real time with intraday charts okay which is a lot easier because it's it's quicker number one and it won't feel quicker when you're watching it with me okay it's going to be probably me droning on about things while the price action is moving okay so i'm going to drive most of you that don't like all of my lectures where i have a lot of insight being shared and things that you don't think are relevant to you because you want to get to give me an entry pattern give me a targeting technique and that's it that's all i need that's not all you need okay because if it was that easy everybody would be rich but i understand everybody has to go through that growth period but when i get to that part i'll tell you this is the part where i'm gonna show you basically what i'm going to be doing in the live streams okay so with that i just want to make this point here because my private group you know who you are i have been telling you for over a year now to download all of your videos okay because the server will not be hosted any longer starting june 1st 2022 as i mentioned we're going to be moving away from videos and we're going to forum posts only so everything i say usually in audio commentary over a video i'll be just simply typing out on a chart because you are now charter members so i don't need to do so much leg work with the audio okay or commentary i can point to certain things and you'll know exactly what i'm referring to what it means and what it's useful for and then obviously i'll point to where it's going to go before it's going to go so there you go makes things a lot easier quicker for me everyone else as well and it doesn't cost me a fortune to run this community it's rather large and since you all don't pay anymore i'm not running a mentorship anymore where you pay me okay no one can join this so that's the distinction they get to see analysis before the fact and incorporate the things that they learned whereas on youtube i'm giving you one specific model a bread and butter approach where you can literally go in there isn't a lot of moving parts i stripped it down to its chrome okay no fluff in it okay straight right to the brass tacks now the same thing i've done with this youtube model my mentorship that is charter member they can do the same thing with what was taught to them they can strip it down or they can make it as intricate and complex as they want that's the private mentorship group it goes into a lot of detail that is honestly overwhelming for the majority of them and as i mentioned when i promoted it it's only for the freaks that want to just know everything okay not that it's going to be useful for everyone but in contrast to what they get and what i'm giving you on youtube i've literally laid a working model with very easy rules that don't really go beyond what i'm going to show so far that in my opinion can make you a consistently successful analyst let's say it that way okay because i can't promise profitability no one can the only thing i promise and this is what i promised in my product mentorship too it's i promise that you're going to learn how to read the markets better than anybody else would be able to show you and i can prove that these things work i do it every single week every single week i outline these things and if it doesn't work it won't hold up so right away you can read the comments in the youtube mentorship and you can see people are really excited because they're seeing the results of simply going in and looking for the things i've outlined i'm not giving you a lot of different things to look for i'm giving a very specific thing during a specific time of day and if you focus there over a period of time you'll start to see things that repeat over and over and over again now they're going to have subtle differences but they generally have the same framework and what do i mean by that well they'll have certain signatures in price where it creates the fair value gap and then it breaks a low comes back up and fills in the gap maybe it partially fills it maybe it goes halfway maybe it completely closes it in we don't need that we don't need to be precise that's what i'm trying to show you here that you don't need to be pinpoint precision accurate you can be very well average in your entry and as long as you're using sound money management you can obviously fare it out you know setups that will yield consistency okay so with all that said now you know the real story i'm not getting shut down okay i'm not going to stop teaching in fact i'm probably going to now uh do more youtube how's that sound okay just to get under the skin of those that just don't like it all right so the dollar index is our daily chart and i mentioned obviously this is you know for the folks that were with me on monday so you're going to have to just take that in stride if you weren't part of that group but nonetheless the idea is that we were looking for a bullish dollar we've been bullish on dollar for a while now and i was mentioning that we would go for the full 100 level we hit that i mentioned we would go to 101. and i mentioned how we could probably draw back down in after hitting 101. that's one of our targets and the second one was going to be 101.947 and just for clarity's sake the other one was just short of 103 but i just rounded it to the 103. i'm not calling a top here in dollar you know i don't do that i'm staying with the online narrative that dollar should keep being pressed higher this is just a in my mind right now until proven otherwise uh just a retracement after hitting another uh premium level now what changes my mind on about the dollar being bullish if we go below these lows in here that to me signals a potential turn or enemy term high forming in the marketplace and it would take a little bit of time even after that for me to change my long-term bullish stance one dollar so what am i saying in short i'm allowing for sloppy price action as i mentioned on monday night's commentary for the private group i know this is going to be confusing for me oh you're confusing me just deal with it folks okay it's free okay so i mentioned on monday night that we could probably see some sloppy price action and i'm not in a hurry to make decisions about actually going in and taking live trades again yet because we just came off passover there's a lot of holiday volume and a lot of money stays on the sidelines during that weekend it may not seem practical to some of you but it's true so we have to work out that little bit of lull in the volume and i give that a few days and in fact it might even be the rest of this week and then maybe next week things will be a little bit cleaner in terms of the price action so higher prices on dollar that's what i'm looking for until proven wrong and we've obviously seen two targets here hit the 100 level and the 101 rather handsomely so i have that level highlighted here we'll drop down into the hourly chart now okay you see how we moved up in at the 101 level look what they left here see that see how clean that is price does not like to leave those types of formations in in its week so in other words even though we had a market drop even though we took out a swing low even though we had a fair value got even though it came up here and filled it in look at the body's respecting that it's beautiful that's beautiful price action yes there's a little bit of movement above it with the wicks here okay but the bodies look how it's telling the story there that is algorithmic price action okay that is delivered by an algorithm that is not buying and selling pressure okay that's not supply and demand it's not harmonic it's none of that stuff it is the algorithm delivering price on its terms and we as speculators have the fortunate opportunity to be participants in these opportunities when they are presented but they're not going to be profitable because of things we learned in books indicators didn't drive markets higher or lower any retail logic did not drive markets higher or lower these markets are going to book print and deliver on the basis of its algorithm now either you understand that and get in line with that or get run over if you're winning in any school of thought and i don't care what it is i've done all of that stuff okay the only time that i can look back and see when my trades were profitable is when i was in line with what the algorithm would do anyway now some of you watching and you may be watching this as a new viewer for some of you this may be the first viewing opportunity you had with me it's going to sound like this guy's talking conspiracy well it's not conspiracy it's obviously you know we're running electronic markets now and ai is driving it and there's really nothing you can do to change it so the only thing i can suggest you is just investigate the things i suggest are happening in the marketplace and i promise you if you spend no i don't know a good month you'll either see it if you don't move along there's a lot of other people that are very friendly on youtube i'm not saying that they're good i'm not trying to represent anybody saying as a good teacher but there's other people out there are willing to give you their time and you go chase them but with the dollar index showing even the signatures that i have been showing you in the youtube community doesn't this low being broken here in that very gap hits it right there we have another higher variable you got so what does that mean it could trade up into that but we're looking for the entry in here and then look at that now is this a one-minute chart no how about a two-minute chart five no of course not five fifteen minute no it's an hourly chart and that same fractal nature of that pattern i'm teaching you in the youtube community it exists here now if we look at the high and the low that whole price swing here from that low up to this high here that parent price swing if you put a fib on that and find out 50 percent of that it's going to put you about in this area you're saying i'm eyeballing it but ultimately right below that low isn't it interesting that's exactly what i was teaching you in the youtube model but i'm teaching you to use it on any market don't be on this team mentality because i already see it brewing in the comments section a lot of futures traders are like yeah ict you know i love the nasdaq trades and the e-mini s p i love it we're future traders we you know we love what you're doing like i just discovered future trading i did that stuff back in the 90s 1992 i cut my teeth on all that stuff this is applicable to forex it's applicable to bonds it's applicable to futures okay i have students that'll swear by it working in crypto for the folks that are asking about crypto i am not a crypto trader if i traded crypto i would blow my accounts out okay there you go i'm not good at trading crypto if i was believe me you'd hear about it but i'm not okay so i bloomed where i was planted okay so i'm good in forex i'm good at futures that's it okay i don't need to be anything else i don't need to be a jack of all trades and meet everyone's expectations if that doesn't you know tickle your fancy i apologize but again back to the website earlier you're welcome to go see someone else if that's not what you're looking for but it goes to about 50 of that parent price like here from here to here that's algorithmic so we have a break in structure here fair value gap here the volume of the move is inside the bodies of the candle see that we always allow for some inherent price action with the wicks and the tails of the candles but we're looking for the underlying narrative it's likely to go back in here and fill this one single candle that created that imbalance this candle's low this candle is high that small little imbalance right in here it goes up and fills in that spends some time there then breaks aggressively attacking all the stops below here here here fills in the gap and then goes right below that low why because equilibrium exists between this low and this high why did it drop like this because it hit our second target of 101 and plus it's 100 points or pips above the full 100 level where is wait where's that good grief here it is okay so we really stretched above it and then we had this now to me this looks a little bit like them trying to produce this sentiment idea that the dollar has topped i'm not convinced of that yet okay it could and i could be absolutely wrong and these highs are may be the you know the ones that top the dollar that always exists that's where i can be wrong i don't mind being wrong by not trying to pick tops and bottoms i don't mind that okay it doesn't make me feel inferior does it make me feel like i don't know what i'm doing it keeps me on the right side of institutional order flow institutional order flow is rooted on higher time frame bias okay and that being for the dollar it's bullish well it's bullish in my opinion let's say it that way so while i don't subscribe to the idea that we have topped here i like the idea that we came back down into this run and it looks like for everyone else that may be looking for resistance ideas and a break in you know the market structure and a break and re-test idea i don't think it's that simple i know some of you will argue and snickers oh it is that simple that's fine that's for your model but i'm talking about calling tops and bottoms in the marketplace that's what i'm specifically honing in on i think that we're going to revisit that 101 level and we have unfinished business above it that means it's likely go a little bit higher than that that's what i'm subscribing to right now i'm not convinced at all that we've changed gears now why am i beating this up because some of you didn't listen to me when i said that some of you didn't listen to me when i said it the second time because you have selective hearing you're waiting for the word order block or fair value gap or break in market structure because you came into this video with preconceived notions or expectations that i'm going to somehow qualify your analysis that you think is going to happen in forex so therefore when i say these buzzwords your ears are going to perk up and you'll be real attentive then and then what will happen is you're going to do something in the marketplace based on that and not even listen to anything else in this video because i'm talking too much that's going to be the excuse but you're not listening okay you have to listen and understand what i'm teaching you that's the lecture here do not try to pick tops and bottoms you don't need that there's a lot of opportunity between intermediate term highs and lows i don't mind missing the long-term high in a long-term low i don't need that i can be wrong in trades trying to be bullish on dollar i don't trade the dollar but if i'm bullish on dollar that means essentially i'm what bearish euro bearish british pound versus us dollar all foreign currencies i'm bearish on and bullish one dollar that's essentially what i'm saying here so i don't want any of you taking what i'm saying here in one sentence or one little notation that i make reference to in a specific chart and make a sentiment idea okay or a justification for your trade so just be mindful that okay all right so 15 minute time frame we finally made it south side liquidy resting below these lows in here swing low and we had cell side resting below here as well so as i mentioned too clean up here they're really building the idea that this is resistance i don't think that's the case and we might want to go a little bit deeper if it retrades back let's go back up to this here we could trade back to the 100 level maybe sneak below just a little bit to make everybody think this is really done if i was making the market for a dollar i would take it down below 100. dip it into 99.95 or 92 in that area here and then start to work it higher that's that's how i would do it because it would convince everybody out there that the dollar is probably topped and then i would take it the other direction you know what i'm talking about it happens most of the time in your trades you get in and you take something all sudden no it's not as bullish as i thought it was and it went lower i've been there focused on i'm not making fun of you all right so here is that hourly fair value gap but now look at it with the lens of the 15 minute time frame so we have this area here but then we have this imbalance right there so it comes up a little bit deeper closes that in what do these two up close candles represent a bearish order block so we can use the low of the lowest up close candle and its opening price you draw that out in time hammered it why is this an order block well it's because it's where price was delivered on the upside even though it's indecisive candles here that up close right before this displacement to the downside it's not listen to me folks it's not what these folks are taking from my videos and writing books on amazon completely wrong and there's a lot of things i'm going to keep from even my private mentorship group about order block theory until my books are released okay and i've purposely held that back why is he holding back everything you know it's because i have four books coming one's a one's a fiction and three are technical okay so i'm gonna put things out there because there's a lot of people out there have falsely stated that they created this or i copied it for something and you don't know anything about order blocks okay trust me you don't know anything about it but you know enough to find something that repeats over and over again in the second book in my trilogy i'm writing when is it coming out you'll know more about that as i come this is a whole pandemic thing messed up the delivery schedule i had for him but the second volume in that trilogy i'm gonna divulge a lot about order blocks so that way the world the community and trading will know it's mine and you'll know more about it there so anything that happens after the fact i'm going to correct a lot of people that think they need to talk about blocks because actually harming people that pay them or listen to them and it's not true so really what they're saying is the stuff that goes along with supply and demand and i'm not supplying demand but why are these candles here on order block it's because we had the change in the state of delivery where it's already dropping then it goes higher so the algorithm is putting a it's kind of like a a bookmark okay this is where it will want to refer back to in the future okay think of it like that so let's say you're reading a book okay and you're in this chapter and all of a sudden real life kicks in you got to go back to work or you can't read anymore because your spouse says you know you need to do some things around the house and it knows nudge so you have to stop reading you put your little bookmark in the page where you're at okay and then you come back to it later on well when you stop reading that's essentially where this candle closes and then all this happens while you're away from the book and then when you come back to the book here you pick up with the storyline and what was the story line it was dropping it just had a little pause in here and then we go right back to the storyline so maybe that analogy doesn't fit you but it makes sense a lot of ways to me okay it's like a a reference point that the algorithm will go back to because the algorithm doesn't know where your specific stop is at all times your broker does but the algorithm doesn't necessarily know where your stop is or my stop is at any given time but it's based on the logic that is really promoted and regurgitated all the time in books and seminars and course teachers and things put your stop rate above the high put your stop right above the highs you know it's always the same thing all the time and it doesn't take you know a rocket scientist to sit down on the chart and say yeah well if it's been dropping find a short-term high most recently and that's where right above that there's going to be buy stops for anyone that's short they've trailed their stop-loss down so what does that mean it's like anyone that went short up here and was fortunate to be right and it does this move here starts to break down their stop would be moved from here to right above this short term high that trailing stop loss mentality okay i'm not a real big fan of rushing my stop and that's why i teach the way i teach because i'm looking for things that make sense and i'm not trying to strangle the marketplace but this order block here is a change in the state of delivery it's been going lower it's likely to go lower this displacement qualifies that order block because it creates a fair value and the narrative is likely to go lower now this lower movement is short term in nature it's counter long-term bias okay you can and will absolutely lose money trading this style trading because you're going against the higher time frame order flow this type of trading if you go in and you're trying to be very nimble trying to go in and think you can you swing up and down buy sell buy sell and you just recently started you're going to absolutely blow your account okay that is exactly what's going to happen so don't do this so why am i teaching this so that way you don't do it understand that this is all part of a natural retracement and you can trust and study and back test all the things that i've been teaching you and they exist even in these moves here but you may not and don't be offended by this you may not have the skill set to see this type of retracement lower and short it that's okay you don't need to have that skill set i have students that are really good with trading contrary in setups like this that don't trust bias because they think the moment they get in it's going to turn on them so they like to take contrary in trades where they trust it more because it just makes sense for it to be broken if that makes any sense in other words they they know that this possibly makes heat going higher because they hear me saying it but that doesn't change their convictions about being a contrarian and in some ways they're going against what i'm saying is a higher time frame overflow bias but they know how to pick these opportunities where there is confirmation is not likely to continue at that very moment so therefore they'll go in and go against that bias and take trades now is that wrong no because it matches their personality and they know where those opportunities exist do i think that all new students should go in with that expectation and that mode of study absolutely not no way absolutely no way because if that's what you really are internally as a trader it'll materialize and manifest itself over time but the only way you're going to know that is by learning the way i'm teaching it because i'm teaching you how to trust the higher time frame bias okay i'm not teaching the trend as your friend because the things that they're using to you know promote those ideas i don't subscribe to so since i don't subscribe to those views i don't look at it that way so i'm looking at how the market moves from discount to premium premium to discount and also within market structure so some of you at times will point and say it looks like this or it looks like that over here it's only momentary familiarity it looks familiar but it's not there's a whole lot of other things going on that just sometimes look very similar to certain things but there's a specific criteria that takes place that i'm looking for that i teach my students and you've learned a very simple approach to that that's existing right here in this chart in the youtube model alright so you're a dollar daily chart all right so it's been a while since i've talked to the youtube community i think it's been like two weeks or so and that something to that effect um but i drove your attention to that low i said we were aiming for that and as luck would have it look it went down there so that is an example of bias that is an example of what i've actually talked to my community about for well weeks as it was starting to come down we were up here looking forward to come down to that low i mentioned this low here i mentioned these lows here and this low there and you all on youtube knew that we were looking for this run on euro the problem and this is why i'm not trading forex at the moment okay no forex is not broken no i don't think they're ever going to change the algorithm no i don't think that they're going to change their algorithm or go against the things i'm teaching because the way i'm teaching is the market itself it's the internal engines that make these price deliveries appear on your chart okay that's why i'm teaching it and with with no real reservations because i know me teaching this isn't going to change anything the level of trades that are being pushed through these markets is not going to be changed by you watching these videos because honestly i've taught for years and there's a lot of people that just simply cannot follow instructions they can't follow rules and they want to fault somebody else they're going to fault this one over here they want to fault me they want to fault the concepts when there's people already out there proving just from the free stuff that they're passing competitions and challenges and you know making money in their own accounts you're doing very well in demo they all have a wide range of experiences already and i've only started the last week or so in january so this business is very personal and it's going to reveal a lot of things about you and you're going to see things that you didn't recognize before and sometimes it's gonna be ugly you're not as good as you thought you were you're not as astute as you thought you were you're not as responsible as you thought you were believe me i learned those lessons in the 90s and it was not fun and you resist it and the folks that resist it will never get it and they'll never learn how to trade properly from anyone else because they have a deep-rooted issue within themselves so it won't make a difference if somebody else steps in and says hey i got something that's going to do it for you ict complicates things i'm going to give you this thing here you push a button and it gets you in no the same underlying issues that are plaguing the individual will manifest in any trading approach because they lack responsibility number one they lack the adherence to rules and they have not put enough time if you're not getting instant gratification you're done that's what the main critical thing about me is because i'm lecturing i'm teaching you what you're going to encounter you may not feel this is applicable to you but i guarantee you stay long enough in this you're going to be met with this and if i don't tell you how to deal with it or overcome it or think about how you should be overcoming it when you get to that bridge okay because you're all going to get to it eventually different times different people everyone grows differently but you're going to have these crossroads where you come to where you feel like you know i don't think i should be doing this anymore i think i should be doing that or the grass looks greener on that over here or this person made money over here and i haven't made money this week so maybe my stuff's broken let me go and look at this that's nonsense there's people out there that don't trade like me and they make millions because they are good money managers period that's it they have something that gives them a decision-making process they call it their system okay or their edge but really they're just good money managers period they have something that instigates the idea of a transaction in the marketplace they have a faith based system in believing that as long as it doesn't do this go down to a level where they would put a stop they'll stay with that idea and then when it gets to another level they get out that's trading okay but the idea is i don't think that profitable systems outside of what i'm teaching are linked to their actual system it's linked to their adherence to their rules sound money management and not over trading and not over leveraging because literally i could flip a quarter and you could too with sound mounting management you could make a account be profitable now that sounds crazy okay do it with a demo i said i'm suggesting to you here flip a quarter if it's heads you buy flip a quarter if it's tails you sell short do it every single day don't risk more than a half percent aim for one percent and do that buy the open sell the open that's it that's all you do use a use a 30 pip stop and trade a forex pair and do it okay and just test the idea and see how hard it is to blow the account it takes a lot of effort to blow that account but over time you can see that it can show profitability now if you take that application and apply it to okay what happens if you limit your number of trades if you remove the frequency at which you trade intro week that means what days of the week you're actually going to specifically trade on and then within those days what specific time of that day are you going to trade on and then what asset classes are you're going to trade and inside that asset class what specific market are you going to trade and inside that specific market are you going to be bullsh or you're going to be bearish so you're refining everything down to an algorithm or a recipe because a recipe is an algorithm okay you have this list of ingredients and you put these ingredients and find them in a specific order and at the end you should have an expected result being a cake or a cookie or whatever it is that you know your mother grandmother used to make for you bottom line is i'm giving you recipes now it's up to you to decide on what you're going to do with this information i show it as you see every single week in my mentorship group i talk about where the market's going to go beforehand i'm not telling you to buy or sell short anything at any one particular level i'm pointing to where the market's going to go because i've already taught you entry strategies but i'm not trying to force a specific entry strategy on any one student or all of you collectively because there is no pressing all of you into a mode because that will absolutely guarantee failure failure as an as a mentor and be failure for a community of students i'm cognizant that there is a wide disparity between my personality and everyone else's and just as well as if we were on a room we would all have different personalities as well that's going to be an issue for all of you so my teaching style allows for you to find your own style in the tools and concepts that i teach now i could trade with every single one of them and my better students can do it with a a good list of them but i don't have one student out there that can do everything well perfectly that doesn't i haven't had that yet i'd like to believe before i pass on i will but i don't have that yet but i do have some extremely good traders some consistently good profitable traders but i also have late you know failures you know these folks just simply can't get it now in the youtube community give it time you're gonna you're gonna see people commenting that they can't do it okay my encouragement to all of you is the same thing i'm going to tell you that i tell my private group in their form do not gang up on them don't make fun of them don't say oh well you know this that i don't think um be encouraging today because really if they're posting that they're hurting they feel frustrated and they're basically saying unless someone intervenes right now i'm gonna quit and i have done that there's been nobody to tell me keep going okay back in the 90s i just had to persevere i'm hoping by me showing these things publicly talking about what's going to happen where it's going to go it proves you that it's possible to forecast these price moves now what you do is you go back inside all the moves here and decipher what it is i'm pointing to and why it was useful for you to find a setup in it and is does that set up repeat enough for you to justify that specific way or approach of trading what do i mean by that some of my students can't day trade they just don't have the ability to do it they have businesses or school or they have jobs and they have to be you know making ends meet they're elsewhere they can't be in front of the charts so they have the position trade so that means they're going to have to trade on the daily chart or a four hour chart and that's fine you can do that it just takes a lot of time to move from these levels here down to here and then you got to wait a long time for the next new setup i'm not a fan of that but i'm not trying to discourage anybody that has to operate under those restraints but i mentioned on the youtube community in the mentorship videos for this channel i mentioned that we were going to be aiming for that low we got that it's sloppy on its delivery but it got down there back to why i'm not touching forex it's because of this type of movement here everything is really muddy right now the reason why currencies are not moving well is because trade is being hindered there is a supply chain congestion all these factors are causing currencies not to move if you look around everybody that is been in this business for a long time that's consistently trading profitable they're noteworthy they're kind of like the the pillars of the trading community none of them are really talking about currencies right now because it's a quiet asset class it's a sleep right now i don't think it's going to stay this way forever okay and when it springs back to life everybody's going to want to go back into currencies okay but right now it's a really slow market and it's really hard for a trader to learn in this environment because you want to see excitement you want to see animation in the price action and i get it that's what we want as traders so what i've done and i do this in my own analysis studies and teachings and trainings and the way i teach my product group too they'll test for it in the comments section you tell me i'm a liar okay if i'm not doing this every week with y'all every month every year i navigate the marketplace so i'm taking their attention to where the markets are going to be big movers where's the excitement i do that beforehand i'm not waiting for something to happen oh let's go over here now it's exciting no i'm always before the big moves start coming forex is not it right now okay index futures has been now we're also entering a period where it could get a little dry may typically can create some scenario where it's bearish i'm looking for evidence that's going to continue but we'll get into that when we talk about index futures but euro dollar delivered as we were expecting we got the lower prices and that same movement and idea of reaching for that low here is basically what i'm doing with the live streams but just with intraday charts okay so in other words what do i what i what do i promise to do with all of you you know the few times in may that i'm going to do the live streams i'm basically going to outline where i think the draw on liquidity is now what is that the draw liquidity was below this low here all this movement here each candle going lower each day it went down even though it made a low here on this candle and a low on this candle and a low here even this candle being up close and this candle you not quite yet making that low but then one day we smash down through it and we dug in a little bit deeper one more time not deeper than that low but deeper below that low on a daily basis you know we had one two three four five days below that old low and we came back up in i'm going to basically point to where i think intraday price action is going to go now i don't want any of you to take that as an invitation to go and trade on that that's the worst thing you can do not because i suck not because i can't trade not because i'm not good at analysis because i don't want you to do that yet i'm forcing you to study price action you have to learn how to tape read and if you can't tape read you will not be consistent in your trading period and a story that's the way it is because everything that you'll be doing if you make money is really not based on the market it's based on circumstance and believe me i've had periods of being profitable with just dumb luck it happened folks in the 90s i really thought when i first started that wow i read a book you know and i watched a couple videos and wow this stuff really works and what i was really doing was just buying a perpetual bull market and everything was going up i could have threw a dart at the wall and whatever it hit i was buying that and it made money everything was going up so it tricked me into thinking i knew what i was doing at the time and i didn't so i want you to take the live streams i do in may and sometimes it'll be forex majority time is gonna be futures don't be part of that team mentality futures is the better thing forex is the better thing it's just right now futures you know i have a vested interest in proving to the youtube community that number one i know those markets better actually than forex i started in futures in 1992. the same things that i always answer everyone okay let's say if you're wrong ict okay i understand i ask you all the time in the comments section what happens if you teach this to so many people will the algorithm be changed will they change the way it is will they go after people that use this blah blah blah i don't believe that's the case but let's go out on a limb and say ict is wrong okay say that the whole world goes to one currency okay and everything goes upside down and 4x no longer is there what would i do well if i was here i would go back to trading futures period so i don't want you to think that team futures is better than team 4x because believe me when forex comes back to life it's going to smoke index futures and it's going to be all kinds of excitement back in currencies okay it that's the way it is folks it moves in and out of you know asset classes are really really hot and then they go cold and something else gets really exciting it's this navigation through the asset classes that experience and those with experience doing it know how to do 30 years you know i've been doing this stuff 30 years and those 30 years the greatest lessons i learned was what i'm suggesting and talking about right now to some of you young guys okay it's just too much talking but these are the things that you need to understand because they're going to be the impediments to you succeeding because you think every day there's going to be a big move in the euro because you see something just because you think you see something doesn't mean that that market's going to do anything look how consolidated it was for this day here here here and here then finally it just whips down below that low that could be very frustrating for someone that has been expecting this thing to go down and for instance look at the folks that would have been trying to break out go short below that low here it does so here and it comes ripping right back up in the same day and that might have changed their opinion about the market going lower but i teach that that liquidity below that low is where it's really going to go so these up close candles really are just opportunities to go short and then drive it lower okay so i'll talk a little bit more about the live streams when we get to the e-mini s p part all right so admittedly this video is a lot more talking than i normally do is because i'm conscious that there are two communities here so i'm having conversations with both of you now to me it's normal i can do these kind of things i can go back and forth and start a conversation leave it and do some other things and come back and fill in the gaps i wanted to talk about but i know this is the type of video that's going to drive most of you that are really really critical it's going to drive you nuts but i promise you if you listen to me there's some really good stuff in this video so just take what you you find useful in which you don't find useful just filter out so here's the hourly chart on euro market traded down aggressively here on this day swept below that low here's that daily low let me go back that way because i've done a lot of talking probably didn't make note of it that daily low is one point zero eight zero six in one pipette that's that line right here okay so an hourly chart it breaks down slams below it and look at all this price action in here see all that this is during passover week last week when i wasn't trading and we hit that same low here we rally create a fair value gap there run right back up to the old highs in here and optimal trade entry from the high to the low we went right up into a short-term premium so as a short-term trader going counter-trend remember i was referring to on the dollar index where i have students that are contrarian if i'm long-term bullish on dollar they know where to go in and pick their shots where it looks like retail will see it as a reversal and that's how they made their model so i'm bullish on dollar they'll wait for retail to think that that bullish dollar has topped and then they'll go in and find their setups so hopefully that made it more clear about what i was saying earlier well what would that look like with euro well it would look like this we would have a run back down in to old support which is on daily low rallies creates a fair value gap buy it in here right back above the bodies of these candles into the 62 retracement level because 62 and 79 tracement levels are what i teach is optimal trade entry range but it's not optimal trading entry for the setup okay so in other words we could be a buyer down here and trade back up the 62 percentage level or the bodies okay around around above the bodies of these candles here just pick the 62 tracing level and just make it really easy for yourself but that would be a nice little run in here it's not a lot of pips i mean what is it 20 60 50 it's 10 20. 30 ish 30 40 pips thereabouts not bad bread butter type setup but that would be the version of a contrarian trade against the bias that i'm suggesting to my private group which has also been shown to you in the youtube community being bearish on euro until we got below that low here now for the youtube community you're all scratching like okay get to the point where it's going to go where is it going to go next okay this is what i mentioned on monday to my private group now i'm telling you now just because we're doing this style of teaching tonight because i don't have the time to do multiple copies of the same video in my private group then make a youtube video so what i'm choosing to do is make a very very long irritating video that has a lot of information in it for youtube so i don't have a bias at the very moment for europe i don't have a clean level it's going to go to and then reverse okay i've been specific recently and you both communities have known that but right now we're back in that sideways consolidation congestion area and we have to wait for displacement and what does that mean wait for something like this okay if we get it on the upside okay great that's fine it'll give us something to work with in terms of a range if it breaks lower it's fine you will give us something we can work with in terms of a range as well what do i mean by that well from this high that low we went below these lows in here and then we created a short term break in market structure here so this low broken came back down in fill the favor you got spent some time in here a lot of time okay this is typical with a holiday and then starting into a new week it's slow volume and then we get this little bit of movement and we pop right back up into this range high and low fifty percent of it's like right here above 50 we're going to be looking for a premium so 62 the 79 tracement level that would be your objective so if we get a displacement lower i'm going to look for this type of move here just repeated later on vice versa if it goes higher i don't care at this point because it hit my objective my objective was i wanted to see euro go below that low okay this level here on the daily chart since it's done that and i am neutral near-term on dollar i'm still long-term bullish but right now i don't see a setup to go in and say okay now there's something to do now for new traders or new students here that doesn't sound feasible you just said you've been doing this for 30 years you can't find a trade right now not on a daily chart not on the four hour chart and not on the hourly at the very moment at the time of this recording the way the charts are laid out in front of me i have nothing to go on at this very moment that's also another reason why i'd like to do this because i can't really tick off the private community because i'm not really giving this youtube channel the prognostication i usually give them but i'm teaching and lecturing and i'm giving it kind of like a a complaining contrast of what they're getting versus what you all get and neither one of you should be fighting with one another or jealous of another okay because you all had opportunity to join and no one's allowed to do it anymore so let's go on to your dollar 15 minute time frame and you can see here again really nice fair value this is what i was referring to on the hourly chart it's just really clean here on the 15 minute now when i say clean what do i mean by that we have a nice run up here it returns back to that old daily low and then we have what displacement that real energetic run higher that is algorithmic when it creates this gap here we don't care that it's still stretching up here now as a new trader or someone that is impatient that doesn't have an understanding what they're looking for it will feel like an impossibility for them to say i'll wait till it gets back down here and then buy because what will happen is once it does when it trades down like this they're not going to look at that and say oh yeah i feel good about that they're going to think man this thing what happens if it's going down below these equal lows because that's what everybody on youtube is now teaching because i mentioned it no what's the narrative we're short term right now oversold on the daily why because we took out that old daily low we went below it so now it's taken what out of the marketplace sell stops or sell liquidity so what's the market going to look for now buy side liquidity that means it's got to go higher to get that so energetic move off that same daily low and it creates that displacement when it trades back down into that i'm thinking okay well it's created this short term high it's going to want to run back up into that but even if it doesn't if i just get above the bodies of these candles in here and reach up into that 62 retracement level on the hourly chart as i mentioned right before i transitioned to the 15 minute time frame we reached up into that 62 treatment level so that would be an opportunity to be a buyer here and sell sure you know not sell short but sell your long there and be done and there's about 30 pips or so that is a bread and butter trade now that is not a style of trade that i would recommend you as a new developing student because it's going against the order flow these are types of moves that you want to go back and back test and then because you're doing that what will happen is over months and years oh here we go he's kicking the cane down the road justifying why his concepts don't work because i can't make him work that means i didn't spend enough time that's his excuse no it's the truth you are going to look for a setup that you watch in a video one time and you're going to expect it to work every single day between 8 30 in the morning and 11 o'clock and because you see what looks like a fair value gap your bias is going to be wrong or your expectation on the daily candle itself the individual daily candle which i'll talk about teach later on this video yes it's an impactful video tonight it may be boring but i got a lot of stuff in this one you're going to do something incorrectly because you're in a rush because you want to feel like you have to know right away it works for you and there is no right of way in trading except for blowing your account because if you don't know what you're doing right away you're going to blow your game okay it's what's going to happen so i talk and i teach like this so that way you know you have been fortified with all these things in advance what to look out for what not to fall victim to how to think about it a mental perspective on what you're doing as a trader and what the market should be doing they have to be in agreement and it takes time for that to happen it doesn't happen by watching a video it doesn't happen in 40 days okay it doesn't happen in 120 days it doesn't happen in the first year it takes a little bit of time so there's a lot of fumbling that you're gonna have to do to figure out what you are looking for because right now if you're just starting i'm promising you right now you have no idea what you want to do and you're probably not realizing that what you're going to evolve into the end results of a speculator what you're doing as a trading model and how you're trading the markets you don't even know what that is yet that's a gradual thing that becomes well obvious to someone that has taken this on as a business not i'm going to school i'm treating this like a college degree well that's good when you first start but you need to treat this like a business are you going to open up a business and just not worry about it every day you're going to be worrying about it every day and you can put all your time and effort into it that's how you should treat this every day whether the transactions that you make are profitable or not they're all learning experiences so that's why back testing is important keeping a trade journal is important annotating your charts and referring back to how it worked off of that daily chart which is what i'll talk about tonight also all right finally made the british pound i'm going to go through this one pretty quick because i've already spent a lot of time jaw boning all right so we had a little bit of a fair bay got here rallied up in that mention we were going to go below that low we did and as i mentioned on monday we would have a consolidation type sloppy type price action environment where we're not yet out of the holiday doldrum last week a lot of money was on the sidelines so we're waiting for the smart money to put things in motion and then it'll give us another bias as to what we're looking for i'm maintaining a bearish stance on british pound versus us dollar because i have a long-term bullish stance on dollar so everything i think eventually will bend the knee and go lower like euro pound aussie you know all those currencies should go lower if i'm wrong it'll trade above the fair value gap if it does i'm wrong as long as we're below the fair value gap here i'm bearish on cable and for new people cable is pound versus dollars is the nickname for it all right so here is the hourly chart i'm just going to make it very simple sweet to the point there's nothing here absolutely zero nothing in this chart nothing to trade on not one thing i can't look at this and say oh i gotta set up here or i could do that there's nothing okay nothing here at all take a deep breath and hear that again there's nothing on this chart that's noteworthy now think about that does it feel comfortable for somebody it doesn't feel comfortable it's like what there's got to be no there's nothing here that's the difference between what i mentioned when i was looking at the 15-minute time frame on euro i said how nice and clean it was there's nothing clean in this price action it's all back and forth back and forth it's sloppy price action okay when i say things are sloppy this is it there's nothing that you can very easily pick out as okay it's bullish it's gonna pull down to a specific level and i expect it to rally from there i don't have any of that here nothing's in this chart that's noteworthy or what i would ever put money behind so when it looks like this we roll along here is the 15-minute timeframe sloppy nothing here so when you go through your charts if the marketplace that you're looking at creates these scenarios where it's just really messy what's the first thing you should consider closing the charts turning your computer off and go do something you love to do spend time with your family good friends and hobby chasing whatever it is you're doing otherwise outside of the markets which is what all of you should have a hobby outside of this not just watch my videos or someone else's stuff have something you do outside of trading because you have to have an outlet and otherwise you're going to burn out but when the markets look like this you don't touch them i'm not talking about my community knows that i have not been really and it breaks my heart because this has always been my favorite pair but i have not been touching british pound for a long time months months have gone by i've not done one trade in this currency pair because this is simply not delivering what i'm looking for now some of you are thinking there's proof right there they're changing the algorithm no it's just a mess right now the whole world's all messed up and trade has been affected by that so it's going to show its hand and manifest itself in the currencies and this is what you have trust me folks in the offing just over the horizon there's something about to happen and when that happens these markets are gonna get real real excited and they're gonna be moving around a lot and everybody's gonna be like man i'm gonna go and trade forex trust me that day's coming what day is it exactly i don't know but i'm being patient until it manifests itself when it does you're going to know it everybody's going to know it but when that creates that man it's going to be what i call salad days it just means easy trading so don't don't get bummed out by looking at this and thinking oh this is actually a good thing because it teaches you when not to be doing anything when it feels alien it feels counterintuitive or counterproductive or the opposite of what you're in here learning about you're thinking i'm learning how to do this so i should be able to open up a chart and go and find a setup yes that's reasonable for a neophyte but you want to learn how to do this profitably right i mean i would hope you would want that you want to do things consistently right hopefully that's what you're trying to do i'm trying to promote that in you maybe that's not what you thought about when you first started but you want to be able to know why you're doing something and when not to do it knowing when not to do something is crucial because it'll keep you from blowing your account it'll keep you from being undisciplined and it'll give you peace of mind it'll remove that fear of missing out i don't have any fear of missing any of this price action here it's not gonna i'm not losing any sleep over it and you shouldn't either and when your market whatever that market is is performing like this just leave it alone take a break you don't need to trade today you don't need to trade tomorrow if you feel that understand this and listen okay put the potato chips down put your drink down listen you do not need to trade every single day despite what you're thinking and feeling you don't what you need to do is understand why today or tomorrow is a day that's highly probable that your bias will deliver to a target that you already know is likely to be treated too and i'll talk about that later in the video but you have to have an expectation of where it's going to go where is it going next higher or lower if you can't reasonably outline that then you're gambling and if you're trying to trade every day or you have this impulse that you have to be treating you have to be in there you have to be doing it that's a gambler's mentality i do not promote gamblers i do not promote gambling i do not promote over leveraging i do not promote lucky over leverage trading i promote one contract work on trying to double your account how long does it take i don't know how long is it going to take you i don't know but that should be your goal work with the lowest leverage and try to double your account if you don't have the patience to do that you're a gambler you're trying to rush to make big money and there's only one end result that comes from that you blow your account i'm telling you folks if you don't believe me watch when you try to do it and you're going to be coming back and saying in the comment section you were right i wish i would have listened and then the true test is will you repeat the same error thinking you're just weren't schooled enough yet okay you didn't have the skill set yet now you do because you watch two more videos and then you do it again then you'll write in the comment section i just blew my account because i didn't do this and i didn't do that what's wrong with me i'm telling you what's wrong with you you're rushing and you're gambling and i don't teach that so you're doing what everything i'm telling you not to do so are you really ready to be taught no once you break yourself and you have no more money in your account and you have no more money to put back in the account and you are questioning whether or not trading is for you that that is the student that's ready because they have nothing to go in and gamble with and it's all up from there or they say trading is not for me and guess what that's the right decision because you know yourself better than anyone else if you decide that you know what i've tried this i've tried that it isn't working trading is not for me well god bless you you've probably saved yourself a fortune because there's a lot of people that this will never work for because they are not disciplined they're not responsible they're not going to they're not going to follow the rules and they're not going to do things as they were taught and they'll find fault with everything but themselves and that is mental illness i experienced it i know it firsthand and it's painful it's embarrassing it is deflating it feels horrible but it's not permanent it's absolutely corrected by certain things and skill sets replacing bad habits that's all but it takes responsible discipline and a routine and adhering to it and being accountable to someone who is that someone you trust say look this is how i'm going to be doing my studies in my trading and i just want to show you what what i'm doing and it's better if you're in a community that is like-minded and that's what i try to foster i try to create that and unfortunately what happens is people on the outside that usually take shots at me or you think this or that about what i do what i teach or my students they'll say it's a cult when all i'm trying to do is empower that individual to be an independent thinker i don't want you to believe me or anything i'm saying i want you to go in look at these markets with the lens i'm providing you if i'm a fraud and these don't work you're going to know right away if you're really putting the effort in you're going to know right away if these things are valid or not but for those that have done the work nobody's convincing them otherwise now that it absolutely is the truth and it's consistent but when i say consistent that's not the same thing as it happens every single day in the same pair that you look at like for instance none of the things i'm teaching are existing in this pair right now that's why my private group and none of you have seen anything with this pair from me for a long long time because it's not showing clear clean price action so since it's not doing it i take my hand off of it and my attention goes elsewhere where has it been diverted to index futures index futures will have this type of price action soon does it mean that index futures trading is dead no does it mean the algorithm has stopped working no it just means that it's being heavily manipulated so what does that mean for you internally don't touch it this is a rattlesnake if you see a rattlesnake on a trail and you're walking down there and you hear that rattle i've never seen a rattlesnake live in front of me okay but i'm telling you what i'd recognize it if it started rallying and i'm gonna stand still and i'm gonna look around and find it and wherever it is i'm backing away from it simple well i treat these times in the marketplace just like that because there were times where i looked at this and said i'm better than average bear i'll get in here and find the honey well there you go i got stung that's why i'm talking to you like this folks you gave me your time you gave me your ear and you're giving me your trust i'm giving you the best advice anybody could ever give you don't discount it as just talking droning on pontification no this is real insight folks it's three decades of it i lost a lot of money not doing what i'm teaching you to do like i'm teaching you the very things that i fell victim to and how to avoid it wouldn't you want to do that i mean i i would literally give everything i had back in 1992 if i had someone like i'm trying to be for all of you i'm trying to be that person that has real world experience that knows what's going on proves it and i'm trying to show you lower your expectations on yourself don't try to be an olympic trader okay you don't need to be olympic just be consistent if you find a bread and butter set up once a week you can do a lot with that it just takes consistency and money management the money management does the heavy lifting the the hardest thing is finding something you're going to trust and stay with and when it doesn't deliver or when you can't find it in your market it doesn't change it it just means you stand still that's it and it's hard it's real hard because what happens if you go two weeks without taking a trade what's that going to do for your mindset for some of you it's going to try to be nuts others it's going to make you want to change the style of trading and they're both wrong 30 years taught me that books didn't teach me that books talked about system hopping but you don't really know that lesson until you blow accounts do dozens of different trading styles and approaches that don't work they have no sound logic in the marketplace why it's doing this and doing that diversions indicator this harmonic that all those things are something that promotes the idea of a religious view on the marketplace and not just time and price time and price is not a religion it's the truth that's what these markets deliver on look at the chart what's what's at the bottom of the chart time what's on the vertical axis price why are you complicating it you're saying i'm complicating it why are you you're adding triangles and shapes and all these things and moving averages and all this stuff on your chart instead of just looking at what these candlesticks are documenting where was it an hour ago where was it last friday was it likely go today where is it likely to go by the end of the week if you ask those questions every single time you sit in front of the charts you'll have a pretty good idea of what it's likely to do what happened every single time no but by itself that right there was just mentioned to you that was the first steps for me to stop looking at those books those books are going to tell you things that ninety percent of people that trade lose money on let's be let's be honest folks let's just call it like it is okay all of those books all those teachers all these youtube channels everybody out there is talking about the same things that result in the 90 percent blowout of live traders so why are you holding on to that stuff with a death grip no no no it's gonna work for me i did that same thing and i lost blue accounts over and over again crying tears weeping why can't i figure it out those things are in a 90 percent bracket of losing money if you walk down road and you see these glasses of water free to drink you walk over here you pick it up you sniff it just doesn't feel right and you take a step back and watch other people walk over and they assume they take a drink they start choking and drop dead right there how many people do you need to see pick up that glass take a drink and drop dead before you realize it's probably not a good idea for you to have a swig but unfortunately marketing is what it is okay there's always some clever little way gimmicks is what they are of making it seem like there's this new twist on something old okay and bad logic no matter how much lipstick you put on it is still bad logic and you can't change that so the idea is for you to find it in the price action the things you're looking for on the chart or in price action they must appear clearly in price and if it's not clear if it's real muddy and just choppy like this it's indicating to you that this is not a market the smart money is going to sit down and say yes we're going to operate today it's heavily manipulated it's not being allowed to trade freely it's held so if it's being held and manipulated do you want to be in there because if you are doing that you're gambling so don't do that all right so we made it to the futures portion of this long-winded video about nonsense right all right so daily chart on the e-mini s p all right so we have the market trading down into a very very deep discount if you look at the range low here why am i not picking this one here because this move started there okay that's what i'm looking at this move these are relatively equal lows so i'm just going to move over to the most recent swing low why is this swing low it will candle to the left of it that has a higher load than this one and the candle to the right of it has a higher low than that one so that swing low that one here to here that's my daily dealing range okay the market has recently retraced back down in about fifty percent equilibrium of that price move okay so that's what we're annotating here about halfway is what really essentially is being shown and also because of that the market is likely to create a little bit of a retracement now on this video i did a teaching called purge and revert okay and i'm going to talk a little bit about that tonight and how it's a little somewhat of a variation on that idea and premise but i want you to think about how the market created this low here and then the reaction and price delivery on this day here on the 19th and on monday night i was mentioning to my private group and you all know i mentioned this i'm actually going to put a clip from monday's video in here so that way the folks that were not in that group they would have the and the insights that was mentioned there that way you can see what i'm showing here is not pointing to something that after the fact i wanted you the both communities to appreciate what i'm teaching not to beat the chess not to show off not to say on smart okay but i want you to understand what i'm showing you here is rooted on sound logic it's not chance it's not gambling so because this daily chart has retraced down into about half of the move from that low that high so we basically went back to equilibrium or roughly a short term what discount so because of that there's a likelihood that the daily bias is going to be bullish on this day here and this here now we're going to look at this candle because midpoint of this candle that right there is the mean threshold mean threshold is the half point okay or median of a order block that's what this line here is representing okay so when i drop down into the hourly and lower time frame that right there is rooted on this up close candle why am i using that up close candle because from this high down into the 50 retracement of that low and high where the market goes back to equilibrium or short-term discount that means the bias has a likelihood now folks listen you want to be taught about bias i'm teaching it listen it went down to equilibrium or short-term discount the next day we can expect it to go higher so what do we do with that information if it's likely to go higher the next day or the day after that what happens if the next day is down or if it doesn't move okay you go into the next day expecting it to go higher that's it that's all you're doing it's not hard right but you want perfect you want your recipe for those chocolate chip cookies to come out like grandma's and sometimes guess what it isn't going to be like that you're going to have to take it the way it gives it to you and sometimes your cookies ain't going to rise this just so happens that what i outlined on monday panned out but that's what i'm referring to every single week i'm outlining something that because of the logic that's that one good setup that you should be focusing on as my students what am i going to show you here in this this is your premium array that means it's going to draw up into that it could be this candle is low because it's the order block they are shorter block why should i be concerned about this candle because in this move here right before this displacement on the downside this was the last up closed candle so you have several targets here you have the candle low the open the mean threshold half the order block and you have the high the high is the less likely the easiest is one down here so on this candle here when we expect it to go higher we can see it trade up into that candle's low we can see it trade up into that candle's body we can see it straight up into that candles mean threshold so it's not a matter of me picking levels and saying look how smart i am look it hit that level but what about those other levels you didn't see for those people that think like that or if you ever hear that or see people talk like that here's what you respond to internally don't even worry about them because they're not interested in learning all they're trying to do is be a distraction to you i promise you if you put the work in you will see the results you're looking for the lowest hanging fruit which one's the easiest for you now if you look at that in respect to this candle here so if you're buying on this day if you're buying down here below the opening which i'm going to teach in detail in this video if you're buying down below the opening not that i use this particular opening price but let's say you did say you bought this specific day below that opening price on that candle right there and you were buying below you could find profitability reaching just up into that candle's low draw that out in time you can use the body draw that out in time here hits it well today not yesterday's trading because that was yesterday's stream and you have this here being hit there and he had the mean threshold of the order block there so there's several targets now for you as a developing student you want to pick the easiest one which is this one here and be content if it hits that now blending that with the idea of purge and revert now purge and revert you can do a youtube search on that it's in my youtube channel it's a teaching that i'm going to allow you to go back and look at yourself but it's kind of built on that same premise here we went down we took out short term low sell side liquidity see that right below here so we purged cell stops and it's going to revert back to the high in the last three days so day one two three that's this day here so this candle is high it can draw back into so we have the s this quarter block low but then we have this idea here where the move dropping down that high is going to have what resting above it buy stops why would there be buy stops there because traders that are short they're going to trail their stop loss right there it's going to be more easily understood when we're dropping the lower time frames but just know that that's the framework i'm showing here you are going to have to listen to this part of the video a few times don't be against that okay don't don't feel like i don't want to do that trust me put the time in to listen to this portion of the video because this is exactly what nobody is teaching you because they don't know it but this is what goes on and it's also the reason why i told my private group on monday night what took place yesterday all right so we're dropping down to the hourly chart and here is the e-mini s p june contract market traded down into that short term low ran out sell stops here or sell side liquidity so it purged that liquidity then we had all this sloppiness starting the week and then we dropped down and rallied up doesn't look too clean and clear in here and does it it's okay it's about to change we're going to drop down the lower time frame because we have a bias i mentioned on monday that i felt that this was going to go higher and clear up all this here and that was the draw on liquidity now here's that part of the video i said when we get into the discussion about live sessions what am i going to be doing basically what i'm going to show you a clip of when i get to the 15 minute time frame i'm going to show you the clip from monday night's private mentorship video where i discuss before it happened where the e-mini s p was likely to go why i felt it was likely to happen and i'm going to amplify that here so that way both communities can appreciate what it is that i'm going to be doing with intraday price action the guys over in goldman sachs and you've been with me for a while you know who i'm talking about uh they like to say that intraday is just noise and one of those guys actually said he tried very hard to make it work and if anybody tells you the injury trading is profitable and you can do it consistently run away from them because they're a con artist okay it's kind of funny that you know i'm proving technical science okay because it exists it repeats but you have to know what you're looking for okay and i'm going to show you that here i mentioned the opening price on the midnight candle and i mentioned the opening price at 8 30 and there's a lot of confusion as to what that means and what am i supposed to be doing with that information i'm going to cover that in this video too but i want you to look at this hourly chart and just see this movement here to here see that you don't have any reference points inside the hourly chart here that's okay i'm going to show it to you in amplification to what i was showing my group on monday night before it happened do you see how level these two highs are here see that this is what i dub relative equal highs that right there engineers buy stops for anyone that chases this going they're lower to think that this is the area where resistance is so their stop will be placed above that does it take rocket science to understand that no every book tells every trader that reads the book that stops get above the old high and this is resistance because it went here stopped went lower it tried one more time here and then went lower so this is strong resistance now granted i'm not trying to make a case the hourly timeframe is strong okay but there's a lot of people that trade these lower time frames and they'll see that as what formidable resistance so they'll feel that this is safe the market should keep going lower they broke this low so that means it's going to keep going lower and when price starts going sideways like this slightly up it's going to look like what to them it's a bear flag so they're going to look at this high down to that level and project that same movement lower as a measured move and this type of thing happens because they didn't use the contacts that i'm providing you both communities understanding how the markets move from discount to premium premium to discount that's it and then what pd arrays within the current market structure and what narrative so what is narrative what is that well we have the market trading down into that short term low below old lows about 50 of its daily range that i mentioned on the daily timeframe so we purged the sale stops where is it going to go higher why it needs to go to buy side because it's now collected sell stops so smart money is going to do what offset those buy orders that they used to pair up with the sell stops below these lows they bought those sales valves so now they're net long how do they get out they have to sell them to willing buyers but at this point down here and over here who's going to be buying from them at a higher price the value stops that are resting about here so you have to think algorithmically how do you pair your orders if you don't have this mindset going in before you click the enter button of your trade you are gambling you have no idea what you're doing you're trying to guess you're in there seeing what would happen if i did this and then when it works you're telling yourself wow if i did that with real money i could quit my job in three months wrong and when it's bad you're thinking oh well i wouldn't have took that trade anyway i'm really cool and astute i'm an apt pupil of price action no you're a gambler you're dabbling with a demo account and you're not learning anything you're conditioning yourself to believe that these sensations that you feel when it's right it's skill and when it's not well that was just you just playing around you weren't really doing anything serious about it and that creates toxic thinking and it builds a false sense of security and in certain instances some individuals literally go out and say well i'm going to put live money in there because you know i got lucky a couple times and i could afford uh you know a couple thousand dollars and i could do this and i could do that if i made that and that's what that's what everybody does they fall victim to that i don't want you doing that you have to have a real reason why you're doing something even in demo otherwise you're teaching yourself to think well and properly about what it is that you're trying to do in these marketplaces so the logic is we're looking for to run about here and now think about that in this area here here's the 19th on tuesday i told the group that it was likely to go to here and i'll show you that clip when we drop into 15 minute timeframe but they'll think about what does your daily candle look like if it's going to likely go up to here and we're down here it's going to create what a little bit of a movement down make the low of the day then rally up to clean that little well and we're not trying to predict the closing price on the daily candle we're not trying to do that we're trying to participate in a move in the morning session that gets us long that allows us to run up into this area here and that would be your target you're not trying to get the move that goes all the way up to 45 90 if it was to do something like that i'm not suggesting it is but i'm saying that you have to pick these periods in the marketplace where it makes sense for you to anticipate and expect a certain move to begin and originate in and where it ends or where it finds its terminus so point of origin terminus buy orders on smart money sell orders on smart money retail buy orders retail sell orders that's the continuum that goes between smart money and retail you have to change your thought process about what you're looking at in the charts and that is narrative looking for the daily delivery on that candle judas swing buy below the opening price expect displacement to the upside run into liquidity offset sell to buyers move to the sidelines you're done now what does that look like on a lower time frame here's the 15 minute time frame here is the relative equal highs buy side liquidity wrestling there look at this price action in here what do you see pause the video this is that moment where you want to study and look at it okay i'm going to continue now all right so here we have this low why am i picking that low why not that low michael why didn't you pick this low michael this here is a range that we worked in and i mentioned this is brutal when i was discussing it with my students on monday and it's commentary but this movement here this is the most recent swing low it rallied up and it created a higher height right above these relative equal highs so there that 0.1 to 0.2 that's your dealing range okay i'm using that because it's the most energetic most recent low and high this is where i think the market's going to go up to because i think all of this movement down here basically has accumulated all the cell stops so now smart money's heavily net long and they are sitting on all these you know counterparty traders that either were knocked down the marketplace and they absorbed all of their cell stops or they're caught offside and retail is trying to go lower it doesn't make a difference i'm not suggesting that you should even waste any time trying to figure out what that is i'm just saying that below old lows sell stocks below old highs is buy stocks just have it in mind it's just that simple now knowing that by itself is not enough you need to know what is likely to occur here is the midnight candle in new york okay how do you know that over here on trading view click this little area down here it'll pop up a list of time zones and such scroll to new york always put your trading view chart on new york i don't care where you live you do that everything i'm teaching you will line up midnight opening price the opening price is here draw that out in time and that's your new york midnight opening price this is the price i want to preferably be buying below now there are instances where the opening price will be lower and then the market is trading higher but doesn't go back below the midnight opening price this is why i said 8 30 opening price 8 30 is when a news embargo lifts and a lot of news comes in around 8 30 typically and i use that opening price there now in this instance this is why i'm teaching it to both groups today because this is kind of like a just a dandy of a setup means it's really good i like these types of setups i'm going to show you here when it delivers something like this it's almost like it's presenting it to you on a silver platter like if you really really want a good little setup that's going to just just be a real nice cracker jacket just delivers nicely it's this one here okay if we're bullish okay and i'm assuming that you'll trust me when i show you the video clip from my private mentorship group folks that are in my private mentorship group if i'm sharing something that was edited if i've changed that video in any way to make it seem or sound like something that really didn't take place on monday at the 13 minute mark of that video please say so in the comment section okay you're welcome to roast me okay i'm only telling you that because the comment section is open on my videos you guys can say whatever you want to say i don't care bottom line is i'm proven it okay i'm proving it that way you can feel comfortable learning from me there's no sales pitch here anymore just put down all your reservations and just grab a pen and pad and listen and i promise you what you're looking for it'll come the confusion you're getting about the opening prices at midnight and the opening prices at new york 8 30 a.m last ditch for power 3 is 8 30. what does that mean if the opening price at midnight if you're bullish is lower than price is trading at around 8 30 or after 8 30 then it's likely it's not going to be a factor then you use 8 30. if there is a day like this one here where we have the opening price at midnight here we're already below it and then at after 8 30 we're below it again still below the midnight candles opening price we're really in a discount like we're really really cheap on the day when we're bullish now think about what i've outlined so far it seems like a long way here but everything i've discussed is paramount and crucial for you to understand why this is occurring because these are the things that are going to repeat don't take my word for it start back testing and logging your charts like this and you will see these events repeating because it's algorithmic it will not do it every single day but every day it will be present in something that's why i say with my motto it's every week every day and it won't stop it does not mean every week every day and it won't stop every single individual market because you have to be able to navigate some days it may not happen in the futures it might be in forex or it might be in bonds so you have to be flexible in that regard okay but every single week there's this type of setup every single week there's a setup like this inside this range it moved from here to here and then started retracing down after midnight notice that so all of this here is a judah swing judo swing is the move that's opposite to what you expect the daily range to be so if we're bullish and we think it's going up here we like this movement going down we love it now you may not feel comfortable buying the london or overnight lows that's fine you don't need to wait for 8 30. if we drop below 8 30 opening price and here's the here's the kicker we're below the opening price at midnight two we are really really oversold does it take indicators to see that no did you require some kind of divergence nope how about a fibonacci nope easy isn't it visually see what's being shown here below the opening price you want to be a buyer at midnight by itself that's always the the basis of what i'm trying to do each day then if we get a 8 30 candle that opens below the midnight candle and then we have a movement below that that move here also is like a micro judas swing for the session of new york this is the judas swing on the daily range or the daily candle so this is basically building the low the daily candle this is building below the new york session both are using the power 3 concept which is accumulation manipulation distribution so what we're saying is this movement below the opening price at 8 30 and below the opening price at midnight each move lower is the trap it's the snare that catches traders thinking it's going down we are looking for that move we're looking for that drop down not just any indiscriminate drop in price we're looking for a very specific thing now i'm down into a five minute chart same things i had on the 15 minute time frame i now have just showing and representing it on a five-minute chart i want to take a look at price study think about what you see in price action here pause the video if you're not ready i'm about to begin right there see that fair value got right there see these two down close candles that that's your order block that's bullish your favorite value got and 8 30 we have a drop down at 8 30 we're looking to the left and see where are our short term swing lows because we want to absorb sell stops because smart money will pair that with their buys and we're looking for an imbalance preferably and we just happen to have it also with an order block so a lot of things happening here it comes down hits it and then rallies 8 30 opening price we find it come back down into it find some support and it springs aggressively above the short-term highs by itself that right there's enough that's a that's a beautiful run on s p and that would be enough you don't need to have the objective up here but if you're holding it for the daily range you're going to wait for it to reach up in here and it does so here now in this area here knows what happens it rallies up and consolidates during lunch and around the two o'clock hour going to three o'clock we run back down into cell stops traders that have trailed their stop-loss up because they don't want to lose any of their profits and then they pump it one more time up into the pm session or afternoon move into the liquidity that was outlined relative equal highs on the 15-minute time frame here is the one-minute chart how can you apply what i've been teaching you on the youtube model well here it is here is the low forming and now find the setup that would occur with the youtube model so we're seeing a movement here the bias is bullish we're looking for continuation on the upside we have a target based on that 15 minute time frame relative equal highs what does the model i'm teaching on youtube where does that exist here again pause the video use this moment to really look for it yourself if you just wait for me to show it to you you waste the opportunity on learning all right don't be upset if you don't get it it's okay but i'm going to show you now what you should be seeing okay the market has a run above is short-term high so we have a shift in market structure that's bullish what's this a fair value gap i trade down into it hammers it three consecutive down close candles that's what your order block all consecutive because we're looking at one minute candles that is the order block with a fair value got buy it there and then comes back down retests sends it higher and then one more time new york midnight candle opening price opportunity again it trades up into the new york midnight opening candle trades back into another gap trades into the midpoint of that rallies up consolidates and then expands up into our objective that was outlined in that 15 minute time frame the relative equal highs let's dig a little bit deeper notice the price low here it's around uh what is that 43 70 something 476 or something like that just for the sake of clarity we'll just say 43.77 okay 43.77 is around here on this day now what i've shown is the daily chart but on an open high low close bar not a candlestick because i want you to graphically see what's occurring here now this opening price is not the midnight candle opening price because you can see it's about what is it 4404 and a half or something like that that would be just above where this opening price is so my opening price is just a little bit above this opening price so i'm not using the opening price on the daily chart on trading view you can there's nothing really inherently wrong about that but i don't personally do that so that way for clarity and continuity i don't use the opening price on the daily candle i physically go into my chart and use the opening price at midnight once that candle begins trading at midnight that's your opening candle price for midnight and same thing for 8 30. as soon as 8 30 starts that opening price on the candle that's my opening press 8 30. so i have to wait till 8 30 scandal or 8 30 exactly the time right when that happens that's my opening price i'm not referring to any opening or closing price on the candle okay what i'm forecasting with my analysis concepts and teaching my students is i'm teaching them to anticipate these types of moves so the relative equal highs on that 50 minute time frame is basically this candle's high go back and look at your charts and you'll see that's exactly what that is so this short term run below this short term low is taking all the sale stops on that day on the 18th the 18th that evening i was telling my students that that is when i anticipate that the s p should go higher and run for those relatively equal highs on the 15-minute time frame because we've already went down into a deep discount daily chart and it's likely to come back up and grab that liquidity even if it's just going to keep going lower that's still okay it doesn't change anything even if it goes higher from here and i'm wrong it's reversed and makes a longer term rally higher i don't care we're looking for surgical strikes intraday for these markets these index futures but there has to be some kind of logic so if we look at what we've done over here and how this fits the daily candle what i'm suggesting is my opening price because at midnight we're a little bit higher and i don't need to catch that very very short-term low that's lower than this one okay because that low is right here and we're actually a little bit lower than that to the left i don't need that this is the reference point at which my methods would see as an entry point so that's real close that's like right in here that's real close to the low of the day i don't need to have the load of day you don't need to have the low of the day but when you get to the new york session opening at equities 9 30 in the morning new york time this run in here that sets it up another opportunity here so we have optimal trade entry here if you want to trade the ote pattern teach on the youtube channel then it rallies up and then you're running all the way up the daily range until we get to this candle's high here which is the relative equal highs on the 15-minute time frame go back into your charts and you'll see that okay this is what back testing does it gives you the logic so what's occurring here is what it's purging cell stops and reverting back to the high in the last three days boom now for some of you that need to hear me and what i said in the video clip in my private group i'll play that for you now 50 minute time frame ump futures june contract 2022 again just brutal back and forth just consolidations and there isn't really a whole lot in here that i like that it may want to reach for except for just the old relative equal highs to me it looks too perfect it looks too pristine too classic support resistance idea okay so you know a lot of people want to sell short they want to get short they want to be bearish on this thing and notice what's happening with all that you know we're going to run higher it brought it breaks lower then they send it one more time higher clean up that drop it once more lower and now to me it looks like they're just gonna send this thing vertical to clean that up if it doesn't do that and it starts to trade lower i'm not chasing it i'm not trying to follow suit with that i just want to give it more time to find out what it wants to do because to me right now we're so deep in discount on the daily chart it can come up to this level here and really not upset anything if it's going to continue going lower that's my point in saying that all right so hopefully i've covered a lot of stuff tonight i talked about a lot of things that students have asked me to touch on in my private group and i've obviously seen some of the comments referring to the opening price what is the opening price what is it why should i use it and how do i differentiate the importance between the opening at midnight new york and that of the 8 30 candle in new york session so hopefully it's been a little bit more clear for you but the main thing is you're looking for an opportunity to anticipate the expansion of that daily candle in one direction or the other either higher or lower and in that direction higher or lower where is it likely to go and the easiest thing i teach is old highs and all lows and relative equal highs and relative equal lows those two ways of looking for pools of liquidity are the easiest most visual representations of targeting there is it's simple because it's based on sound logic that the algorithm will never be changed because of because old highs right above that's always going to be by side liquidity buy stops are going to rest above that and below old lows there are cell stops resting below that it's always going to be that way folks it always will be that way don't send me comments in the videos please don't send me emails asking me that question do i think by me teaching is it going to break it are they going to change their route they're not changing anything they can't change it because that's the way these markets book that's the way it is folks it's the way it is the sky is blue not all the time but the sky is blue the grass is green not all the time but the grass is green you follow what i'm saying so these are rules we live by sometimes there's going to be these outliers these things that creep in that cause your interpretation of price to be incorrect and guess what that means you did something wrong does that mean that you're a failed trader no it just means you made a mistake that you're human i'm human i'm gonna make mistakes i'm gonna read it wrong i'm gonna interpret it wrong i'm going to react too late i'm going to react too soon i'm going to anticipate things that are not likely to occur and then either i have to take the loss or i reverse these are all things that you're going to have to be met with in time and you're going to have to see whether or not this is for you and some of you in all honesty this isn't going to be for you not my stuff alone but trading in general because it's risky and don't ever think that something magical is going to happen if you're not consistently profitable in a demo account and you're not consistently finding setups executing them getting in and getting out with confidence on the lowest of leverage see that's what i don't like about i know some of you are you i'm i don't know how you guys link like when you i don't know how you guys link in the comments people link me but every time i try to link someone either i'm putting their name in wrong it never links it so i never do that but they'll make videos and i see it as a mention in youtube sometimes it's a day or two late so it's not like i'm ignoring you but for whatever reason i get these notifications that are days late and i see folks that are doing videos and are recording themselves actually entering in the trades on the paper trading application trading view which is great but they're using leverage that everybody knows that they are not really in a position to afford so i know it feels cool it feels flashy and you know it might feel like you're playing a video game i don't want you to have that mindset i want you to think about how you can make this as boring as possible because if you make it boring you won't be a victim of your emotions it'll be just like you go to work i'm not saying you love going to your job but you know doing those things that you go to work to do yields you what that paycheck at the end of the week that's your minimum expectation get to work and do what's expected of you anything above that then obviously it's up to your manager to decide whether or not it's warranted to receive anything more than your standard pay but you need to treat this just like that it's a business so when you're doing your executions don't be influenced by trolls or hecklers in the comments section saying oh well you know you you're doing micro lots one micro lot it's not about that size of leverage it's about you finding the consistency of getting in knowing what you're looking for in terms of managing the risk in terms of the points or pips not the money not the money the money is a derivative of doing the right things in the beginning you need to focus on doing the right things the logic needs to be there not the reaction emotionally and psychologically to fake demo money don't do that you're actually causing yourself barriers it really is creating a barrier for you to find success if you do those things it feels cool it feels fun like yeah if i would have been a real trade i could have made this much money but you didn't so let that be the reality you didn't so you're really tricking and conditioning yourself improperly which is the opposite of what i teach my students with back testing whereas i teach my students when they do their back testing in their annotations they write in there as if they saw the trade happening beforehand and by doing that it's like self-talk you're speaking to your subconscious and your subconscious is going to refer back to that as a false memory because it's a positive reinforcement it teaches you because of pattern recognition and over and over again being exposed to the same elements and you're reinforcing yourself with your own comments and your own cheerleading you're fortifying your expectations going forward on this pattern yielding something in the past not that it's going to absolutely work in the future all the time but we as price action traders we look for signatures that repeat nothing is guaranteed that's going to repeat that's why we have to have stop loss that way we know that there's risk in this market every market in trading has risk but if you're going to hone an edge or a model you need to have a framework and you start by back testing and at back testing in your annotations you talk about how it feels good to see this move deliver as i was expecting from this fair value gap up to this bicep liquidity pool during the hours of this and this and this is what my model suggests i should be looking for each day notice i didn't say i was stupid i was playing video games and i was watching some youtuber talking about some nonsense and i missed the trade setup i should have known better never do that kind of stuff not in your back testing not in anything that you're recording in your journal everything has to be positive you're sugar coating everything in your back testing you're tricking your brain to see that as experience so that way when you see it forming live you're not going to be in fear and trepidation of oh it's going to be a painful experience and again when right now you don't have the experience yet but because you keep logging it with back testing you're filling your brain up with a lot of pseudo memories so you're doing the the ideal utilization of a lie this is called what it is you're lying to yourself and children love this you're lying to yourself with positive reinforcement okay so that way when you look at something forming in real time it will be remembered and you won't have any negative triggering because of toxic annotations or toxic thinking you'll have memories of oh yeah i remember seeing that in your subconscious you may not see it or understand it or feel it when you're doing it but your subconscious reverts back to those experiences that you've logged with positive reinforcement don't take a demo account and do that same thing with i'm going to over leverage my demo account or paper trading account and do a size of leveraging that there's no way i would be able to number one put the trade on because i would be too scared because i'm a new trader and i'm going to be afraid of any fluctuation if i put on a million dollars worth of leverage i can't really sit through the spread opening up on me when i put the trade on initially let alone weather the ups and downs and initially you know as the trade pans out you're teaching yourself to anticipate a hopeful outcome with ridiculous leverage and you're teaching yourself that that negative drawdown that you're experiencing is not something to be worried about because you're only looking for the dopamine hit if you did it right and that video game high score means absolutely nothing in your growth you've created a speed bump and sometimes a barrier to being consistently profitable think when you do those things what you're saying is i'm putting blinders on i don't really see the real risk here because it's paper money and i want to show on my video a really high profitability in the end result because you want clout every single time every single time i see one of my students whether from the youtube community or some of my mentorship students that are in private group that have youtube channels they'll make a video and they'll use really high leverage but they may have executed extremely well manage the whole thing from beginning to end my comment consistently is next time even though i've commented and said you're well done on the other stuff i will always tell them next time use realistic leverage that's my only criticism not because of me trying to kick the legs out from underneath them i'm not trying to steal their steam or their drive or motivation i'm being the best influence i can because i don't want them filling their head up with things that are toxic because that's that's what that is it's all about clout and you don't want clout you want consistently profitable trust me being consistently profitable feels a whole lot better than clout on the internet i don't need everybody to love me and look at me i've been here for a long time and there's a lot of people that hate me for no justified reason but the point is none of that stuff causes me to lose any sleep so don't invite those environments where other people can influence your performance your expectations on yourself your model your trading none of these jokers on the internet should have any influence on you none they don't have it on me why because i have rooted deep rooted sound logic in the things that i'm looking for you all are experiencing that you're seeing it firsthand you're seeing it and it's encouraging so don't make the mistakes of adding these little things these flavor enhancers to your experience okay and calling them something that they're not because they're not going to make you better they're going to actually hurt you by over leveraging just because you want to see big numbers show up on your when your trade everybody watching knows that you put a demo trade on everybody knows you put paper trade on they know so don't you know parade around with it like it's a big deal it's not so the way you make it more respectful to your viewers and also remove the element of clout chasing use the smallest leverage let people that want to heckle let them heckle you worry about being consistent if you want to showcase your skill set do the executions and use the lowest leverage possible and let that be the example that you're showcasing so i think i've gone through the whole laundry list of things that i'm supposed to cover tonight in this and i know it's a very very long video i know it's probably long-winded for some of you to like to see me get right to the point but this whole thing was the point and it really is a clinic on how to operate and engage the marketplace using what i'm teaching even with what i'm teaching in the youtube model and i'm just so thankful that the community has really received it well um the comment section is just the love fest and i absolutely love it please don't call me the goat i won't ever heart your comment if you do that it's not i'm ignoring you i just never do that um don't call me a king i don't i don't like those things either appreciation or you know the things that you've observed in your own development i love reading those um i just thank you for all of your uh your support of the channel i think it's wonderful i think the community is growing and i think it's just a healthy experience for all of us and i'm finding a great deal of pleasure doing it which is what i was hoping i'd get from it so 228 000 followers that's uh it's pretty crazy like it's really growing fast at this pace i'll probably have a quarter million by the end of the year which is really nuts but thank you very much for your time hopefully you've got something from this one and until i talk to you on hopefully tomorrow i guess it will be morning so i'll have another video up on youtube tomorrow night around 10 o'clock until i talk to you then be safe

all right folks welcome back it feels just like yesterday last time we'd smoke all right so here we have one of those instances where as luck would have it the hands of fate the planets aligned all those factors came in on something i gave you an analysis last night now before you start snickering and rolling your eyes and sending your husband up to slap me on stage just understand that this is just one piece one little piece of price action in the delivery that the algorithm will likely not every single instance but it will likely repeat okay it's the logic that i've shared on this youtube channel and i've been asked obviously if you read the comments in the videos can i show an example of this working in london session for forex no problem to do that i set the stage with the analysis last night there are folks out there that will say i don't know how to pick the tops and the bottoms or the highs and the lows of the day they don't know what i'm teaching so it's easy for them to say those types of things and a new student may stumble upon their comment may stumble upon their youtube channel and whatever their medium is they follow that logic without investigating it or looking into whether or not these things that i claim are true so without a safety net last night i outlined it for you i explained what it should do why it should take place and therefore we watch and do i see in my chart like you should see in yours what i outlined not exactly to the level i was outlining but the general premise was there what i mean by that well we were in this area here and i mentioned that i felt that it was going to go below the 100 level and if i were making the market in other words if i was the market maker providing the parameters at which the dollar index will go down to set up a buying opportunity i would take it down to the 99 uh 99.92 level okay and you can check me on that with the video i uploaded and i can't edit a video on youtube once it's there it's there okay so i know some of you are actually downloading them let's that's fine but go to episode 19 which is the one i just did last night and listen to the 20 minute mark around 10 second in that vicinity and let it play for a minute or so and you'll hear me outline the very thing that you're seeing in your chart right now so the question is going to be how do i know to call that level in why did i know that it was likely to set up a london setup well i'm going to teach that to you tonight so understand this is not the model for my daughter this is not an addition to the model i'm just simply answering questions because i got a lot of them and i'm not trying to push this inside of the model for this youtube mentorship because the next step is going to be can you go into london and do live sessions so we can copy what you're doing i'm not going to do that okay now some of you are going to be upset say oh well see you're not proving anything well if you're not seeing this as proof move along okay just move along i'm only going to do what i'm willing to do okay and i'm having fun showing what i'm showing and it's really enough only those individuals that want to be spoon fed set ups and trades and piggyback my ideas they're the only ones that really push and twist my arm and they're going to be frustrated so i'm just letting you know that's not going to happen so don't ask i don't care how many times you present it nicely in a comment or request it's simply not going to happen it's important for you to go in and find these setups on your own using what i'm teaching so i mentioned that we would drop below that 100 level why did i pick the 99.92 level okay well if you look at the price action right over here okay we had this run up at the beginning of that candle right there just draw that out in time i gave you about 99.95 99.92 level okay a small little range of about three pips that's what i was eyeballing last night now i was talking to you obviously before midnight now there's things that i teach and have in my repertoire that helps me fine-tune the low of the day you know i'm not going to teach that here and then because i have a community obviously i'm obligated to i'm not obligated here okay so i don't want to be thinking you can guilt me into doing more than i'm already willing to do but just know that there's things that i didn't basically use at my repertoire at midnight that will help me fine tune the actual low within about two to three pips sometimes right on the very low but it's not needed okay the idea that i just gave on the fly last night when i was doing the commentary was really simply just rooted on the idea of this extension and ending it right on that candle's high and just eyeballing it so that's what i was looking at i expected it to drop down i'm not convinced that we're going to see this top yet so i felt that it dropped down here and also being a setup going into london that's what i would expect and i'm going to teach you how to use that information if that's what you want to investigate and study on your own but notice that we ran up above these relative vehicle highs and that's what we ran for the intraday price action target so the height of the day that was set initially around the midnight time frame it dropped down creating the entire run lower creating the london low real close to where i was outlining it not exactly obviously but it's good enough for government work and the market starts to rally and it takes out the initial high of the day but more specifically it aims for these really clean levels you have this high here here and here remember i was teaching just like this level here the market does not like to leave that that is not efficient now it's efficient for technical analysis retail 101 where they'll see that as resistance it looks perfect that's what they want because the books teach that the books are meant to trip you up it's flawed logic folks i mean i hate to say this type of thing to certain individuals because they they take aim at me like i'm trying to belittle everyone else it's not that i'm trying to belittle anyone else i'm trying to shake you by the lapels and simply say look listen to what i'm saying don't believe what i'm saying investigate the things i'm stating in the video so that way you can come to your own conclusion either i'm making things up or there's really logic behind it and you can dismiss 99.9 of the things out there that everyone looks and relies on having your charts as far as analysis concepts or indicators you don't need all that stuff so if i'm suggesting as i mentioned last night in the video that we would drop down here and then start to go higher that sets the stage for what if this is going to be a point at which it reacts and goes higher as i was outlining around this time period in the video that means the opposite should be seen for euro but before we get into that let's fine tune this a little bit more on the 15 minute time frame you can see we drop down creating the low of the day in london open that's our kill zone that i teach here on the youtube channel it's two o'clock in the morning to five o'clock in the morning new york local time so if you are using the time window thing over here set it to local new york two o'clock at five o'clock in the morning that's the kill zone for london open market comes down creates the low of the day runs back up back into an order block here i'll let you look at the lower timing frames and you'll see that is in fact an order block and optimal trade entry and the market starts to create its run up into the relative equal highs sweeping that as a daily objective now if this is the low of the day and if it's what i've outlined in advance and you see that last night beforehand this is what i expected to see price drop down in and then start to go higher at the same time euro runs all the way back up to the previous week's high how is this likely to be a false breakout we have to use inter-market relationships like i'm showing you with dollar index so if you're trading 4x it's important to relate your analysis in the trading market okay for instance if you're looking at euro that's your trading market you have to have a barometer something to measure its movement with and that's market relationships so having that with the dollar dollar coming down to a level outline last night that it would be a bullish area it'd be a sensitive price point to see in advance higher because it's relationship with euro it's inverted so if dollar is going down to that level that level being 99.92 then it's not a surprise to see euro rally higher as it's doing that but what is the euro reaching for this high and it went so far as to go up above the previous week's high so they really reached up in there took out the previous week's high and at that same instance right there that's when dollar hit the objective i told you last night that would be a buying opportunity for a dollar if it's a buying opportunity for a dollar then it's a shorting opportunity at that very moment look at your own charts and study the moment it hits this level here it's the same moment that the dollar index is hitting that area i was outlining last night for a buying opportunity for a dollar so this is a false breakout because my analysis was done and shared with you openly that that would be a buying opportunity for a dollar setting the stage for what as i outlined i'm bearish foreign currency could i have bought that sure because i'm expecting the dollar index to drop down to that 99.92 did i no i went to sleep i was tired so i'm not concerned about that i didn't take the short either i don't care i don't want to be in every single move and i'm not trying to trade forex right now but to prove to you folks that are sitting out there asking to see if it can be done in london does the concepts work can i call a move can i give an idea can i do these things before it happens yes but simply because i can doesn't obligate me to okay i'm not here trying to perform magic tricks for you okay i'm not i'm not trying to do that i'm trying to teach you to trust your own analysis and lean on your own experience even in the early stages when there isn't that much of it it's okay you learn to grow gradually all right so the 15 minute time frame you can see that the euro went up into its kill zone here two o'clock in the morning five o'clock morning new york local time so it creates the high of the day so in this price run we're to start stripping it down i'm going to make it very easy and not make this video very long but i'm going to jump right to a very small time frame chart 2 minute has the very clean fair value gap so after it ran above that old weekly high the market trades lower and takes out that short term low now some of you might see this short term low and say well why didn't you use that low instead of this one here well the reason why is the fair value gap forms right here on this candle once that candle closes the very next candle it opens essentially right at that low so it hasn't really moved away and hasn't really shown me what displacement something energetic where it moves away from that fair value gap that's the important factor so we have the parabolic gap here and then it moves lower than that short term low now we have a shift in market structure the market could have came back up into this run here and offered an entry there but it didn't notice that it went a little bit lower that's fine and then rallies up to that level here this is the entry point now think about where your stop loss would be and think about where your entry would be based on what i taught you using new york session this is an opportunity to pause the video and think about the frustrated annotations you're smirking aren't you thinking i'm not positive so you just might as well get on with it ict okay so here we have a zoomed in two minute chart and here is the fair value gap level that you would be putting your limit order in so it gets filled essentially right there remember it's not going to be placed in the marketplace for a shorting opportunity or entry on limit anytime in here because it has to move away from the fear of a gap so it doesn't on this candle here so we have that run through this short term low we have displacement it was energetic move lower away from the fair value gap it doesn't get to it here it goes a little bit deeper we wait we don't chase it we don't go in here thinking oh well i missed the move we still have time see all this over here the kill zone for london open is still open so we allow for that retracement higher your fill here maybe one pipette maybe a half a pip or maybe a full pip above this candle's high that would be your entry but we're just going to use the actual candle high that would be your limit order entry hypothetically 1.0924 and four pipettes that's your entry your stop also be above the high here that comes in at 1.0936 and a half and the heat or the drawdown that you absorb hypothetically if you would use that entry point is 1.09301 so basically not even five pips okay so well about five pips around about five pips of drawdown so essentially 25 we'll call it the 30 so call five pips there it is done so five pips to draw down and never came to your spot with this gearing okay if you use sound money management how much can you risk if you're risking you know a thousand dollars per trade okay you're thinking about money-wise don't do that you think about it in terms of fixed percentage risk own equity so that means you're simply going to look at how much money you have in the account take that times that by one percent okay one percent is the maximum preferably you should be doing a half a one percent or maybe a quarter of one percent you're learning you're not trying to do a lot in the beginning you're trying to just simply trust the idea of seeing these moves none of you should be going into demo none of you would have done this obviously because we're talking about in hindsight but i'm showing you the relationships of how when the market went to this level here and cleared the buy stops on the previous high on euro that's the very moment that the dollar index went down to the level outline it would be bullish so the teeter-totter effect or the inverse relationships that if the dollar is going to go higher that means that it's going to have weight introduced to euro and it should start to go lower so your entry here and your drawdown and your stop all those being what they are here if we go out a little bit further and i'm just using a five minute chart so i can put everything in the fractal in other words the fractals just move up and then down that way you can see it all and have the candles still be clean and have everything on one chart so that's the only reason why i'm showing the five minute chart it's not that i'm doing anything special with it okay it's just to show you the overall dynamic of this price run up the rejection the optimal trade entry that would be used with the fair value got used on the two minute time frame all the levels and things here being as they were on the two-minute chart and if you did a fibonacci run from the the low here by this one because it was the most energetic starting this price right here that would be your parent price leg 50 is around in here so that would be a nice objective initially that would be your first target if you're going to hold for the full day it could go down to this area here and lo and behold we have that imbalance it trades right into that rather handsomely so there's your example using it i gave you the framework beforehand i told you what to expect in the dollar index and everybody should know that the euro is going to be the opposite direction of whatever the dollar is going to do so hopefully this has been insightful to you and you got something out of it until i'll talk to you next time next week next tuesday actually lord willing enjoy weekend and be safe

all right folks welcome back this is our 21st episode of the 2022 free ict youtube mentorship little tongue twister there so we're looking at the hourly chart on the dollar index why are we here why are we looking at this well i'm looking at this because i want to show you the relationships between a risk on and risk off market if you've been following along in the comment section and if you haven't paid attention or even noticed all my videos in this mentorship the comment section is open okay so you're welcome to make your appreciation known you're welcome to you know prompt me with specific questions that you want to see me kind of like touch on without making uh you know too much of a long-winded request for it i can kind of get a feel for what you're looking for and i'll work those ideas into the lessons that we can hopefully get everybody's understanding on the same page i may not respond to your post i mean not you know directly answering sometimes if it's short and easy i'll do that but if it's a question i see a lot of across the other videos as well i use the videos to kind of like answer it so it's important to take notes because usually you'll find that the questions you have are answered in the progression through this mentorship if you're coming here later than 2022 all right so one of the questions i got and i get this a lot for people that have not been trained by me the idea of using the dollar index is it useful like when i look at the forex market like if the dollar is going higher obviously that's going to put pressure on the foreign currencies and it'll be less likely for them to have sustained rallies they're more likely to have sustained declines so dollar up foreign currency down dollar down foreign currency up the reason why that's occurring is it's a risk on risk off scenario dollar if it is going up as we have here this is a risk off scenario okay risk off scenario implies that generally every other market or asset class will start to decline and this is treated as like a flight to quality okay or a safe haven so money pours into the dollar and it pours out of risk assets that would be like foreign currency that's why i've been telling you to look at the euro dollar to go lower and make a new low on this daily chart and today it did it and now it's random then also this applies as well to the stock market and index market so obviously i'm kind of like pushing the index futures in this mentorship on youtube but it's applicable obviously everything i'm teaching here is universal so it works in everything now i'm not co-signing crypto as a reminder i do not trade cryptocurrency i have absolutely zero experience trading cryptocurrency outside of a demo account or a paper trading account i've never done anything with it i've never opened up a crypto account i have no interest in ever going into that asset class and there it is okay i see a lot of you asking that in the comment section so i'm going to try to throw this out there every now and then as a reminder because i don't do anything with that asset class a lot of students that trade them and they swear by my concepts work in there but i personally don't do it okay so there's that i am a forex and futures trader so that way you guys can know what my specialty is and i want to show you this chart here and remind you of what i mentioned in the previous week in our meetings together in episodes i said that we would likely see the dollar index drop down if i was making the market for the dollar i would see it go down to around 99.92 can go back and listen to the videos and obviously you'll see it it's there and hear it then i said i would run the relative equal highs and start to run it higher i gave you the objectives of relative equal highs and mentioned like 102 103 and you know even my private mentorship group knows there's objectives as well and we have it here okay so i'll leave it up to you whether or not you find this inspiring or not knowing that this was likely to occur for a london setup and then rally higher i want you to look at the relationship between this price move here and go back into commentary where i was referring to that daily bearish order block on the index feature okay so i was talking about the the low of the daily order block the open of the order block and the mean threshold halfway and then the high of the order block being the less likely level be traded to and i'll talk about that when we get into the e-mini s p portion of this episode but for now let's take a look at what the relationship looks like with the dollar versus the e-mini s p so this is the june contract for 2022 of the e-mini s p futures market and you can see as the dollar creates its important low that i called publicly you guys know it i've said it i explained it to you in detail as this dollar was going higher what was going on in the e-mini s p see that inverted relationship there that's why i could go back and listen to the recording when i was talking about that bearish order block on the e-mini s p i said that we're going into may and it's usually a seasonal decline and i'm going to be looking for signatures to warrant downward pressure in this particular asset class and reaching for those relatively equal lows on the daily chart hello look at your chart folks this is this is what it's like to be mentored this is what it's like to know what's likely to occur with tools that make sense there's nothing ambiguous here there's nothing you know splattered across the chart it's just simple sound logic okay i'm hopefully inspiring you to simplify which many on the outside looking at what i do will make snipe remarks like oh he over complicates things and i'm not complicating anything these are very simple ideas and it helps you build the idea of bias it gives you intermarket relationships and intermarket analysis to give you the the trust okay why did i feel you know confident to publicly say that 99.92 level well i explained that why did i think it was going to rally from there because i'm bullish on dollar why did i hint that we're going to be going lower into the e-mini s p e relative equal lows and as we enter into may that's a seasonal tendency so all those factors came together and my experience of almost 30 years was used to hint at something for you to study and if i'm right or if i'm wrong you get to be a judge okay you get to see and weigh me in the balances i've laid it out there in your hands you see right now in this chart what i was forecasting the reasons why i was doing it why i said what i said and why it looks like it does in your chart today all right so here's that daily chart and here's that bearish order block i was referring to and the high i said is the level we don't look for it to be traded to and you can see we didn't even get to it there okay so we route up into the order block and then we had the weakness that was expected as we go into that may month and we're reaching into these relative equal lows that's the next draw on liquidity but for now again just keep your study inside this order block that's taught in this youtube channel okay so while it's not a main factor in the model i'm teaching in the mentorship for youtube here i leaned on that as a basis for my analysis why i felt this was likely to go lower that's the order block that's the one that makes the likelihood of the market turning in this area and then going lower and attacking the south side below here below the relative equal lows here is next and then this low here so ultimately we're looking for a run below here for the cell side now it might want to go down below here and give a little bit of a retracement if it leaves this portion open that might want to rally from going under here up there i don't think it would do that personally but it could happen but it's likely to you draw into that old low here now how we trade once we get there that'll be interesting because i don't know if it's going to accelerate violently to the downside or if we're going to have a sharp retracement higher i don't know that okay i don't care to know that right now i'm just looking for and submitting to the idea that we're going to keep drawing down on the daily chart each daily candle should be expanding lower and reaching into this area okay that's what i'm expecting that's my ideal scenario now if you look at the daily range here today we had a little bit of movement above the previous day so we rallied above monday's high and then failed and accelerated to the downside fell short of just running below these relative equal lows but i still believe that's where we're likely to go a little bit of consolidation in here dropped and we had a nice rally in here now admittedly listen closely folks because this is one of those times where i didn't get it right and i have no problem telling you i was expecting this to rally just a little bit higher and maybe flirt with that 4320 level i thought that we could get one more spike up into that and then i was expecting to roll over and go lower that did not happen okay so let's go into the lower time frame 15 minute time frame here is the midnight hour new york time and the opening price there notice we only had one two little moves above that and that's a really anemic movement for what i was expecting a little bit more pronounced rally higher i wanted to see a little bit of judith swing about 20 handles 15 handles to that effect like that and then break down and create something like this okay but we didn't get it so some of you may be asking and i believe it was michelle in the comment section mentioned that uh it didn't appear that power three was in effect today it actually was but sometimes it's really really small little movements like this and it may not be useful to you but what happens is when you enter the london session which we do here at three o'clock in the morning it breaks down relative to new york local time okay so three a.m new york local time there's a lot of folks in the comments section that are referring to and confused about daylight savings time and such all of that is resolved if you simply just listen to the instructions i gave every single time i mentioned the time aspect if you use this little area down here on trading view and toggle it to new york and all you do is by clicking it a window will pop up scroll to where it says new york you highlight that one click it and then you're set you don't have to worry about it don't worry about daylight savings time don't worry about you know anything as long as you are aware of what local time is in new york set a clock on your computer that always tracks the local time in new york 24 7 365 days a year if you do that you'll never have any confusion about what you should be doing relative to time okay so if you have a small little movement like this it can throw you off if you're expecting like i was i wanted to see a little bit higher rally so in the morning i was looking for maybe a little poke above here didn't happen we broke down retraced back in bearish order block and the imbalance and spent a little bit of time here and then rolled over right before the 9 30 opening okay and i'm going to talk a little bit about the 8 30 and the 9 30 what times you know are useful what are they beneficial to your analysis and what you should be concerned about okay because there's a lot of questions about that but ultimately we moved into the lunch hour had a little bit of retracement here broke down once more and then aggressive selling really aggressive selling into the pm session into the close of the day if you look at the opening price at midnight local time new i'm sorry new york midnight local time that's what this here is that's the opening price this price is useful for trading the london session that's two o'clock and five o'clock in the morning new york local time and it helps me frame the power 3 for the daily range if i'm bearish i'm looking for something to rally above that opening price in london that's my ideal scenario i'm looking for that personally as you can see we really didn't get much of that today it was extremely heavy and just wilted and went lower sometimes that's going to happen folks and in this instance i missed a setup i don't get in what i'm thinking i'm expecting to see so i'm human you're human you're going to look at something in the chart and you're going to have something that is your favorite model uh whatever pattern is you're looking for and it may not even be my stuff you know say you're just here casually watching you're probably not in your head saying yeah i've had lots of instances where i was looking for my particular setup and it didn't materialize and it went the other way without me you're going to miss moves you're going to misinterpret it you're going to read it wrong that's going to happen that's why you have to use a stop loss that's why you have to be controlled about how many times you go into the marketplace and you also have to have some measure of flexibility and that comes with experience you're not going to always be able to see that this isn't going to go up for you initially it's just going to just wilt and go the other direction so when we get into the 8 30 hour and i have the lines really light here because i want to be able to show where the highs and the lows were on the respective candles so this is the 8 30 and this is the 12 8 am midnight candle in new york so this is new york and this is midnight new york so there's a distinction here the beginning of the day this is where i look for the daily range power 3 setup and or the ideal scenario from bear so i want to see something rally above that opening price if i'm bullish i want to see it decline below that opening price okay that's pretty much the basis for the opening price at midnight it may not be a factor for you like it is here it's not much of a use you know for anything except for well here it opened and it just basically went lower from there at 8 30 the same thing i look for those types of scenarios now i'm looking for weaker prices i'm looking for it to trade lower and does it rally above the 830 opening price it never does it's too heavy it just wilts okay keeps going lower now the opening price at 8 30 i use that for again power 3 for the new york session the same thought process i'm using for the opening price at midnight in new york time that opening price fund bears i want to see a move above that's what i dub a judas swing a false rally or a suspect rally i usually like to fade those types of moves as it goes up i sell right into it it's scary for someone who doesn't understand what you're looking at but if you know what you're looking for and it takes a lot of experience and learning and back testing and seeing things you'll be able to do those types of things over time but that same element of trying to look for a short above that opening price in new york when i'm bearish i would expect the same thing to happen for the new york session a rally above that opening price at 8 30 and then decline so i'm looking for something to rally above that and fade it but it isn't doing it today so now look what's occurring here this is really important that you understand this part of it you know that i've been bearish i've made it public knowledge here did we rally above the opening price at midnight no did we rally above the opening price at 8 30 no and we're bearish what does that indicate to you obviously with the benefit of hindsight it's extremely bearish it can't even rally to a short-term premium above the opening price at key levels and time so we have extremely heavy bearish market so it's not going to give us these stunning little short-term rallies that we can feed it's just going to stay heavy and either you get in where you can find small little pockets of imbalance or you miss the move entirely now as it happens today my wife went on a trip i had to take her to the airport i was only able to capture two thousand dollars worth of movement in the s p e-mini that's the only thing i could capture when i got back i didn't participate in the afternoon and looking at it now i missed a really really huge opportunity there was no trading whatsoever in the afternoon my money was made short on e-mini s p in the morning session and that's all i had for today if i would have just held on to what i had in the morning you know i could have done around twelve thousand dollars today alone but i didn't hold on to it i had other things to take care of and that's that's the reality of things you know real life creeps in it's going to happen but for those of you that are trying to learn these concepts these types of movements are going to be very frustrating in the early stages of your development because you're going to feel like they're changing something they're aware of this it's this stuff goes on a lot it happens in the futures markets like commodities like corn soybeans gold oil um stocks sometimes the markets are just simply too heavy and they're not going to rally for you okay to short into it doesn't mean that they've changed anything it doesn't mean that the concepts don't work it just means that this is a market that is extremely bearish and when it's extremely bearish you have to trade it differently and i'll show you what i mean by that here and i'm not trying to inspire much outside of the mentorship but i know some of you have asked this in the comment section plus it helps my own personal group to understand this as well so it'll be a little bit of a refresher for them all right so here's the london open setup this was the move that set up the only real sound entry in my opinion that took place today here this displacement fair value gap rallies up bear shoulder block fair value gap runs into it and then you hold it because at the micro structure shift below the short term low the imbalance we went back up in this inbounds here remember when i taught you about this this one here can be traded two on a spike it can get up in there but your entry is on the lower fair value gap do you see the logic working here you are going to use a stop that's going to allow for the market trading up into this one so you may not like that much risk you may not be able to take this trade that's all part of this game but you can trade a micro or maybe you could i shouldn't say that you can i don't know what all of your your risk parameters are what you can work with in terms of margin but while you're learning in paper trading obviously you you can use anything because it's all hypothetical money and you're learning the skill set but the rules are still sticking to what i gave you in terms of the logic if you have two fair value gaps you're using this as the entry and you're using this as the risk don't always assume that you can get up here and get the best entry because it never went there see that so it's things like this this is what i refer to as a signature in price action these are algorithmic things that repeat but you have to have the discernment and experience and know when it's likely to occur when it isn't likely to occur so anyway let's talk a little bit about the 8 30 time period and 9 30. all right so here's 8 30. i've got the inbounds here after 8 30 now normally with the model i'm teaching you to look for something to the left prior to 8 30. some kind of short term high we want to see it rally up and using the opening price at 8 30 which is here we want to see it rally above that run some stops then break down and create this type of scenario where it has displacement and a imbalance it rallies back up into the imbalance and sells off the model doesn't exist in today's price action on the five-minute chart it doesn't give it to you there okay so i'm going to give you coaching if you will to kind of like show you what was in price and some of the things i was looking at to help get in sync with the move but i didn't ride the whole thing out okay and believe me i'm looking at this today wishing i just would have had at least one of the two contracts i had on one still and just let it run and i could have done you know about eight grand or so but i didn't do it okay i was leaving i was taking my wife to the airport and it's just better if you're not going to be in front of the charts and anything can happen you have to get delayed out there phone doesn't connect with the you know the broker it's just better just to be away if you're not going to be paying attention to the marketplace just simply completely close the entire position also i'll throw this in here too uh shortly before i started doing the recording here i saw a question do i ever hold overnight in these current conditions i stopped holding overnight like 24 hours years ago we had a lot of things going on in the world that changed my trust just like i used to hold things over the weekend and expect continuation going into the opening on sunday and monday i no longer hold over the weekend so i am 100 in a session or a day and out before the close like i'm not holding 24 hours i'm not holding 12 hours you know i'm not doing those types of positions typically my trade is anywhere between 90 minutes to two hours maximum that's about the the length of time that i'm holding and i'm i'm looking to take mine and get out and then reassess things because there's just too much risk right now in the marketplace all asset classes and things are now starting to get a little wild and it could get a little bit more wilder okay but the five-minute chart has the imbalance in here we saw that run and the model i want to see it run above the opening price at 8 30. the opening price at 8 30 is the new york sessions opening price now don't get confused with the new york midnight candles opening price because the new york association in the name new york session is the 8 30 to 11 time period new york local time so i'm looking for this framework to offer power 3 which is a fractal element of accumulation manipulation and distribution that's what power three the three things that is empowering you is understanding those three elements accumulation what's accumulating short positions okay why because it's bearish so smart money would accumulate short positions then anticipate manipulation above the opening price they would assume more short positions there then it starts to go the other direction and they distribute their short positions at some important low that's that we're able to forecast then obviously it's relative to those daily equal lows and old daily lows and projections with the fib all those ideas come to mind in concert with in agreement as well with time of day okay so we're looking at a movement down into around the lunch hour beginning at noon okay creates the important low there we have a retracement during the lunch hour one more time it punches above the high here then it breaks down consolidate start street one two three and then you can expect continuation going into the afternoon session we're not gonna talk about the afternoon session because honestly i wasn't participating in it and it is what it is i'm familiar with this morning because i had some horses in the race today okay so we'll start getting a little bit more detail here here we have the four-minute chart the imbalance here this is one again that is not rallying above the opening price at 8 30. now it's showing 8.28 but that's because i'm showing a four minute chart so don't let that confuse you but the opening price again never got traded above at the 830 candle so whatever that opening price is at 8 30 you extend that out in time and you want to see that rally above now when you have this expectation the other aspect of time is the 9 30 opening that's when the equity market or stocks themselves start trading their new york session so what happens at 9 30 what am i expecting at 9 30 well no number one 9 30 is just when the opening occurs and there's initial volatility now it can be whip saw where it can go up and down real short term and go both directions in a small range sometimes it could be a really large range and clear both sides of the buying cell and then whatever the real move is going to be for the day we wait for that to unfold today we can see at 9 30 it just starts to run lower it doesn't give us a rally at all so it just starts to speed up what's already in motion from three o'clock in the morning during the london open session so at 9 30 all it does is just start to accelerate down okay and the same ideas being shown on a three-minute chart you can see here that a little imbalance gets a little bit more refined trades up into it rather handsomely breaks down and here's another everybody got with a bearish order block now this is one in here where it's useful because you have a little bit more insight as to what it's doing it's too heavy it's not likely to rally there's no reason to look to go long start looking for reasons to get short and anytime you get an imbalance and we're above those relative equal lows on the daily chart because it's going to draw down into that that's the that's the heaviness objective okay why the prices keep going lower lower lower lower is because they're gravitating towards those relative equal lows on the daily chart okay so go back to the chart where i mentioned in this video and showed the daily chart i had that little blue line that's where price is being drawn to okay the algorithm is marching every minute every hour every day to that level how long does it take to get there i don't know that but i mentioned in my group that i didn't want to see it happen like we're seeing it right now because it's it's too fast and it doesn't give a lot of opportunities to get in with it and ride it so you either have to have entries like this which unfortunately isn't scalable with the model i've shared publicly but i do have obviously opportunities to go over it like this and show you that how you can still use the idea of the fair value you got to get in with it but you're going to have to leave out the element of a rally above the opening price at 8 30 and 9 30 just creates a lot of volatility okay the initial surge in the new york session as the stocks begin to trade basically so as a recap here before i go into the next slide midnight new york time that opening price i used that to trade the london open session that's two o'clock to five o'clock in the morning and also to help frame the idea like say i sleep through london which is ninety percent of the time what i do today like i don't do a lot of london session trading and because of that when i wake up and i'm looking at the market around seven o'clock in the morning or so i'm looking at what has happened overnight and did we create a scenario that i would be looking to trade if i was awake during london if it happens then i know that i'm really built in with an advantage on the daily bias because if i'm bearish and it creates a rally above the opening price midnight time in new york and it creates that rally that little judas swing that explained many times already and it starts to decline and i'm below that around seven o'clock in the morning i know that i'm likely to create another little short term rally but it would be above ideally above the opening price at 8 30. but it may not do that and price just remained heavy below both opening prices at midnight new york local time and 8 30 new york local time so everything was extremely bearish and it was just so heavy it could not mount any meaningful rallies many times in my early development i got crushed on days like this where it felt like okay it's too too low now it can't just keep going lower so i'm going to try to buy it now because you know indicators told me they were oversold 1992 1993 1994 i blew account after account after account doing that and it's frustrating now obviously with three decades of experience behind me i know what it's trying to do and where it's trying to get to and it's getting there in a really fast rate of speed now obviously you can get there a lot faster than that but i don't i don't want to do that because it gives no real opportunity for me to engage and participate in and it doesn't give you as the student to engage also with your demo or paper trading account to practice but as real life sometimes is it's unfair okay it doesn't give us what we want sometimes our expectations and our wants are denied and in today's climate that is not popular that's why this market and trading these markets is very very difficult especially for like the millennials okay that ideal perfect always come exactly as i expected sometimes is denied and either you accept that and navigate the markets within perfection and without the ideal scenario for your model or you're comfortable with just letting go and not doing anything and being accepting when it comes to big moves and you can't participate in it there's lots of moves folks over the last 30 years that i missed that were huge big huge moves for instance bitcoin i called that thing i called that thing at 7 500 to 20 000. and then right before 20 000 i said it wasn't going to 20 000. it was 19 700. and i said it's going to go to 6 000. and everybody laughed and went down and i said i was going to go down 3 000 but it went down to like 32 and then i think a couple times i i had it wrong publicly and then i said that we would go to 20 000. by christmas i think it was uh 2020 and then i said thirty thousand modern years and i was off by about 18 hours it went to 30 000 on the second i believe it was on january 2021 and then i said 55 000 and 66 000 that was about as far as i could see it go and we went just a little bit above 66 000 and hasn't been doing much since but i didn't do anything with that with real money so i missed a huge run in something that would have otherwise paid out a lot of money and i've missed a lot of moves in the futures markets and a lot of commodities i missed a lot of stock moves you know while i was teaching forex there's a lot of stock movement and index futures that i didn't participate in guess what it's okay i'm able to still find trades i'm not starving and that's the the reality you're going to have to come to terms and the grip with you have no way of participating in every single move and don't think that you're going to find every big move you're not going to participate in every single price swing you're not going to folks i miss moves you're going to miss moves and it's okay it's part of this game this business is going to still run and do the same things we're looking for all the time and you're not going to participate in every move okay so give yourself the permission okay to be human you're going to do it wrong sometimes you're going to see it for something it's not and you're gonna miss that big move i had a little piece of this today but i didn't get the whole thing i wish i would have but i didn't and it's okay i forgive myself for being a good husband taking my wife to the airport i know this is all too much stuff and you don't care some of you like to say those things in the comments get to the point the point is you do this you're going to have these elements creep in and how are you going to deal with it you're going to get mad and go on the social media you know blurry out and curse and say these markets suck no that's not what you should be doing you should just reason with yourself ahead of time say okay i'm not going to be able to do everything i'm not going to participate in every single move and this is what happens sometimes it doesn't mean the model is broken i promise you and over the next couple weeks you're gonna see the model delivering like it's done in the past and it's fine it's gonna there's gonna be times when the market shifts in and out and the market structure is just too overwhelmingly bullish or too overwhelmingly bearish in this instance you know the bearishness i gave you guys just was a lot more bearish than the model would permit for entry but you can see there's fair value gaps in here you can use to participate dropping down to two minute chart let's see again refined in real nice here and then once more in here and then drop down into that noon time creating an important low which is what i taught you in this mentorship already and that two minute imbalance you can see on one minutes right here and here really nice delivery there and these are just simple little imbalances to get in sync with what is already in motion not needing to see it rally above the 830 opening price because it's not likely to so it takes a little bit of courage to get in here and trade these types of setups but that's what you do or you don't do anything and you just tape read you watch it when it doesn't it's okay i would like to see it drop here and into the drop yes and you study that and give you another fair value gap in here that's not highlighted and it rallies up to a fair shoulder block and sells off and your stop is above here and just because it goes down lower it doesn't mean jam your stop loss to here because that's what happens you need to have time and price behind you before you start moving your stop loss and ultimately trades obviously lower into that noon time all right so i think that's going to be it uh the next episode on thursday i'm going to show you a couple things inside the trading platform on tradingview that i think are useful it that answers a few things and one of those students made mention that could i literally go in and show how to set up the fibonacci so i thought it was kind of simple already but obviously some of you are really really new and you're not familiar with the tradingview platform so i'm going to add that at the end of the video on thursday coming up okay so that way it's at the end and anybody that already knows how to do it they don't have to go through and watch all that stuff but i'll give you another teaching and lesson obviously on thursday and until i talk to you then be safe

all right folks welcome back this is the ict mentorship free youtube mentorship for 2022. i hope you're doing well i hope you had a wonderful opportunity to study and learn this week and keeping up with the lessons so we are looking at the e-mini s p daily chart this is june delivery contract month for 2022 and i want to kind of like bring you back up to speed to what we were looking for over the last weeks or month or so remember back here we had that bearish order block i outlined that as an area to watch that and we're entering a seasonal tendency so we're going to be expecting lower prices we got lower prices i showed you the relationship between the dollar because it's risk off so we have all the decline taking place in the equities markets and i said that we would be likely to draw down into this relative equal low so i'm going to kind of like do things in the trading view platform so that way some of you folks that are asking questions in the comment section like how do i do this and where is this on the platform admittedly most everything i know about trading view my own students have taught me so there's gonna be a comment posted and pinned by me underneath this video it'll be trading view tips okay if you have a tip that you want to share with the viewers that are new to tradingview please by all means just make a post and outline it as best you can i'm sure they'll be well received i might even learn something too all right so we're looking at how the market did in fact trade down into our relative equal lows so this was the draw on liquidity okay now when i train my students and when new students come to me the first thing they want to know is how to pick the right order block because they know it's one of my concepts they want to know you know which is the entry candle what's the entry point where do i get in at okay and that's the easiest thing out of all the learning okay once you understand what the market's likely to do where it's going to draw to okay where is it going why should it get there okay if you do majority of your studying and watching the tape okay reading the tape which is kind of like what i'm gonna outline and showcase in the live streams in may uh just before i get any further in this conversation the live streams will only be in may i'm not trying to make a ongoing thing of this i don't want to promise you you know an ongoing thing but i am going to showcase some things in live sessions that way you can see how to train yourself to look for these things okay i will not be giving you trade recommendations okay i will not be entering trades in front of you i'm going to be outlining basically what you saw me do in this mentorship outlining where this is going to go and it went there i'm going to be doing that with intraday charts okay and i'm gonna point out certain areas to study watch how price reacts right here and look for this type of thing to occur here because i want you to understand what it's doing why is it likely to do what i'm gonna outline okay the best thing that can happen is for me to get it wrong sometimes okay so that way it'll disarm you it'll feel like okay well you know if i don't get it right ict himself didn't get it right here or there okay so i'm going to do my best obviously to try to educate you and show you what i think is going to happen but invariably there's instances it's going to creep in it's not going to be accurate okay i'm going to read it wrong and it's fine do not do not take what i'm saying in my commentaries and or my opinions over the chart that's going to be live don't take that as trade advice do not take a trade and i'm going to say this every single time i do the live stream don't act on it because you don't know what i'm doing you don't know what i'm viewing you don't know what i'm trying to teach you none of that okay so you want to sit still and just observe and take notes they will be recorded they will be on the youtube channel for those individuals that are not going to be able to be present when will those live streams take place there will be a new york session between i think i'll start around eight o'clock in the morning so that way we can get the chart set up i'll give you my views overnight what took place and what i think that cannot counter may present and kind of like build the mindset i will not be talking in the chat room okay the little chat thing on the side you know you guys will be saying whatever you want to say i don't care i'm not going to be looking at that because it'll be a distraction the agenda that i have for that particular day it would be very distracting for me to to read comments and questions and because i know your question is important to you all of you no matter how simple it may be i'll feel compelled to want to answer everything that flashes across the screen and it'll disrupt my concentration so i won't be looking at the chat okay i'm not ignoring everybody for the sake of being rude i'm just ignoring everybody so i can stay on task okay so there's that but we'll begin around eight o'clock in the morning and we'll close it you know whenever i feel the need to do so but i'll be willing to go up to 10 30 11 o'clock okay which is a very long long session i know they may not all go that way i won't be doing it every day either so it'll be a hand-picked selected day in advance that you'll know about and i'll post it on the community tab on my youtube channel okay all right with all that stuff out of the way let's get back into the nitty gritty here so i outlined this area here in this low and i said this would be the draw on liquidity so when you're on trading view over here there's a little segment where you can have a choice of certain things now you can do this so it looks like this is your your bullseye where the market's gonna draw to you're aiming for that in other words or you can use the little magnet icon i teach with that analogy like up here imagine an you know a magnet of some kind down here and price is going to be drawn down to that level here so this is where the liquidity was and they tapped into it today all right you knew about it up here you knew about the order block up here you knew about the seasonal tendency on that line and we have this really nice decline here so i want to take you into the marketplace and strip this down a little bit and give you some more details so we're going to the hourly chart this is why i do powerpoint slides it's really easy to get to where i wanted to be all right so we had a run here yesterday just kept pumping higher higher higher just fell short of this high and then so we had a decline and then the normal pause and then gapped it down then rallied it back up so between this candle's low and this candle's opening right in here that's an imbalance coupled with an actual gap so i want you to take a look at that okay now we have this candle here small little piece of that one here this one this one this one and this one they go just above that area here this is permissible price action in other words this is something you have to get used to okay look at the bodies of the candle see how they're staying inside of that imbalance it reaches for liquidity and stops on these wicks but the bulk of the volume is being held inside this imbalance notice that so now we have the market release go to the downside and then here is nine o'clock in the morning i want to go into 8 30 actually let's go down to a 15-inch chart so here's 930 that opening price here at 9 30 what's actually happening is the equities are opening up the stock market starts trading that's when you hear the bell ding ding you know sudden everybody's clapping their hands on tv whatever that's what's occurring here it's opening so it's running a short term high right here and then breaks lower creates an imbalance here so on the 15 minute time frame what do we see did it take a high out yes did it break below low yes was it displacement yes it was energetic did we trade back up into it here yes so in here you could be a seller and get in sync with the run to try to get positioned for if you are a swing trader or short term trader this could be your entry and an aim for that old relative equal law which is that blue line here remember the two equal lows on the daily chart i drew a line on that's what this is here okay and it ran down into it today at 8 30 right there we're using the opening price did price trade above it yes it's in a premium it's above an old high that makes it a premium too i saw i believe it was a young lady and i apologize i don't recall and i didn't make a note of your name so please don't be offended but i know i saw it where it was saying something to the effect that you don't understand how it could be in a premium because it's above an old high any time the market trades above an old high that is a short-term premium because it's going into liquidity any time the market trades below an old low that's a discount okay now just like the purposes of what people use overbought oversold indicators things can be overbought and still go higher things can be oversold or in a discount and keep going lower okay see that's why i'm suggesting that when people are studying price they can't just assume that an indicator is overbought so therefore it's a good sell or a shorting opportunity it's not always but if you understand the narrative within market structure market structure is not the answer it helps you frame an idea but the idea must be in alignment with the present narrative narrative is why should the market go where you think it's going to go on that particular day based on the climate the economic calendar events and the volatility that's being offered for that particular trading session or day so these are all things that you're going to need to study and i teach on this youtube channel and i'll teach a little bit more when we're doing a live session because it'll be more practical then so that way you're over my shoulder you're looking at it just like i'm looking at it and i'll give you my internal dialogue and kind of like what i'm thinking that is the most salient at the moment so that way your attention is on the right things at the right time but power three which is the open rally up or manipulation creating the high and then the movement lower and then distribute their shorts below an area where there would be stops so smart money would be selling short the buy stops here writing this out and an offloading their shorts to sell stops below those relative equal lows remember when we see those relative equal lows on the daily chart traders are going to look at that as a breakout there's lots of traders out there that have long-term trend following systems and models and if it breaks below those areas they want to be short so that's going to flood the market with what market orders to sell at the market well that's a perfect counterpart to smart money being short up here because they want to buy it at a lower price and while up here they're aiming down here is it hard to believe that when we were already outlining that last week in the week before no we have visibility we have the ability to forecast certain things that should repeat if the algorithm is in fact in control and we understand what the algorithm is doing and i'm suggesting that my experience should indicate that we have that does it deliver here it is okay so you're taking the logic of certain principles and concepts and blending them with market structure we're looking for lower prices it should reach for a specific low but also how does the present narrative allow for engagement with the daily range or power three everything i've taught you so it's the open rally smart money enters near the high today above the opening and they get out down here at an important low and the market closes near the level of the day let's go into a five-minute chart one two relative equal highs you see that now if you're looking at the lower time frame charts let me get this off here because it's no longer useful if you're looking at that like that here's the opening price you know there's what resting above that buy side so buy stops or buy sell liquidity is resting here so it can run up and just to the left of that also you see these highs here they're real close to one another too so for good measure they might want to come up here and clean that out this is a little too much i think it's too rich for the expectation to get to that high but in here is reasonable but here at least okay mark punches up through yes it does take those out then it breaks down comes one more time back above the opening price and then gives up the ghost and aggressively runs for the sell side below here now for some of you that would be enough getting short up here buying it back below the lows and being done and walking away there's nothing wrong with that if that's your model but we're going to take a closer look inside of this area here and see what we see all right let's drop down into i'm just gonna go right to the one minute chart just to save time all right so we have in this area where the market ran above those relative equal highs here they are here the market runs up then it breaks down right here see that right there that's a swing low breaks below it was it displacement yes does it mark come back up into this little area here yes is it about the opening price yes is that enough sure it is you can be short there you have to weather this one more run up into your entry and you may have a little bit of a down but your stop loss if you're entering in this fair value got your stop has to be above the very minimum the candle that creates the fair value gap that's here so your style is going to be above that for good measure you know conservative up here oh but ict that's a lot that's a big stop well look how volatile it is you want to be knocked out of the trade prematurely or are you just concerned about making the maximum amount of money on your trade dismissing the level of risk that's what gamblers do i'm not trying to teach gambling so when you're practicing on your demo account keep that in mind that way you're not trying to overextend yourself the sell side below these lows in here after it hits the fairway you got here and one more time into it well the opening price it breaks lower and aggressively runs below here so not a bad little run there let's go back up to a five minute chart okay and we're gonna go look at the afternoon session here is 1 135 and i remember i stated at around 1 30 that's when i like to go back in now i've taken trades earlier than that but i'd like to see 1 30. after 1 30 the lunch hour has been smoothed out and then there's usually some kind of a retracement higher when it's bearish or retracement lower when it's bullish and you're seeing that here the imbalance relative equal highs it runs up into that right there that's an area you can get short on market delivers a run lower here's another little fair value gap in there it runs up into that that's a short aiming for what that line here that's that relative equal low on the daily chart so today huge huge opportunity day lots of points that could have been uh made available but i did something this morning showing everyone kind of like what reading the tape examples will be like when i'm doing the live session i did some executions just to prove visibility to prove i was expecting a certain run and i believe i was on nasa yeah i was in the nasdaq so let's go over to nasdaq okay that's in here so we're going to zoom in here on this bit of business all right and here is what i had in mind when i was looking at the chart woke up this morning my wife is out of town with my daughter so i woke up and just because you know creature habit your spouse ain't next to you so i had insomnia so i sat up and i was looking at the charts and said well you know what i see well let me ask you what you see before i do it okay what gave me the backdrop for all this in here which i'll explain in detail in a moment but what gave me the realization that this is likely to turn here and go lower studied the entire fractal that's being shown okay pause the video some of you just refuse i'm never going to do it i see steve stop asking me to do it all right so we had this high here we ran above it and then we had the market shift so buy stops taken breakout artist taking in on the market long and then relative equal lows broken so we have a shift in market structure on a five-minute chart in a time when it's bearish we're looking for those relative equal lows to be tagged on the s p and this is not the s p i understand that but the expectation is we want to see these two indices go down on the daily chart so heaviness should be the you know the protocol going into our trading day in here we have what displacement below these lows so there's a lot of energy there so right above that what do we have fair value got oh there's one right here too right what did i teach you this is where you do your entry but i t you didn't enter here right i wasn't looking at the chart yet i'll get to that he's in my mind he can read my mind this fair value got here we expect that to stab up into it so our stop has to at least be in a position where it can weather that so what does that mean that means that you have to either have deep pockets and allow for your stop-loss to be inside this here or you use the micros which is fine um i don't want to do a micro man i want to be in there 20 per point okay but you have to have an account that will allow for that if you don't have that then trade the micro but i don't want to do that okay gamble but not because i taught you to do that so here is the order flow inside of that fair value gap here again a little bit of extra runs above into that fair but you got there i'll put another rectangle so you can get a visual representation of what i mean by that i mean you can clearly see it obviously but i want you to just see it by contrast see this is the rules this is why i've been teaching you okay if there is only one fair value you got then you just put your entry there and you don't expect it to go up into any deeper retracement but because it has another one here expect it to stab up into that now i know some of you in here want to be an ict junior and you want to be in there on the highest candle when you're selling you want to be on the lowest camera when you're buying and i understand but this isn't always going to happen so if you're really only trying to aim for that you're going to miss moves and if it moves like it did today that's that's a heartbreaker because it moved a lot and if you weren't positioned in it and you spent the rest of the day kicking yourself without being greedy about trying to get that instead of where i've already taught you you'll probably miss the other moves that take place later in the afternoon and you get nothing for the day all right so anyway so we had a shift in market structure we move up into a fair value gap here and we have a break lower fair value gap here relative equal lows now look real close folks okay relative equal lows a high being taken here we break down these two candles move right below here that's the same thing as these two candles here being broken with this move here it's a fractal this whole move here is the same thing here just smaller and it creates the same thing the fair value gap here the market trades up into it the body's kind of exp you know respecting that little area moves a little bit above it that's fine but then breaks aggressively lower does it take out the low yet no retraces up in now i have two okay not one i have two narratives in play this one here where we have a shift in market structure there so this is a long term high here we have another break lower it would imbalance so it's an enemy term high this is a bigger one than that one right so this is a long term high intermediate term high by definition they're both enemy and term highs because they have imbalances but this one is lower than this one and this over here is lower than that one so this is a turning point making this by the hierarchy of swing points and marker structure this is a long term high energy term intermediate term because of the imbalance but how they nest together for market structure long-term immediate term now when this is retracing up this is going to be a short-term high inside of a market structure that is really predisposed to go lower because we have long term and intermittent term above me this should respect the underlying order flow and go lower and i'm looking for that lower price that's below here there's cell stops resting below that so as it retraces back up into this up closed candle what is this up close candle pay a shorter block that's not what you've been teaching this michael on this model right i didn't say that's what this was i'm telling you how to read the tape okay but i do teach order blocks on the channel so we're gonna go into this right here so inside this shaded area this is what i'm going to be executing in not what that color i am okay that's good enough may not be your choice but it's mine now all right so we're going to drop into a one minute chart every time i do this i always imagine somebody that has a little bit better understanding how to work with the tradingview platform they probably have a whole lot easier quicker way of getting to where i'm trying to get to sorry all right so we're inside of that blue shaded area on the five-minute chart i'm also inside of this green candle here that's a bullish order block so what i'm doing is now i'm going to calibrate which just meant simply means i'm going to go down and with a top down analysis approach refine that order block that was on a five minute down to this one so the market retreats back up into here into that order block and i'm i'm trying to aim once it hits the midpoint of it i want to get in around that time okay so i'm entering there on that candle and then i'm holding in all this and it drops back down now some of you might look at this and say oh but this is that order block fair value gap here and what happens if it rallies well it does a little bit but what's it subordinate to all the things i outlined over here and on the five minute chart over here with a higher swing high so the market structure is bearish i'm not looking at this setup this is why i'm telling you i tell this all the time okay is me teaching my order block theory me teaching my fair value got concept is it going to become ineffective no because number one it takes a lot of discipline you have to be absolutely organized you have to know what you're doing and that's why a lot of people just teach it from hindsight because they can't really they can't really do it so you can sound real smart you can sound real educated and in you know institutional quote unquote but if they can't do it it's useless so if i'm showing you these things and i'm telling you also look around majority of the people that parrot what i teach that means they're mimicking by saying what is i already said like an echo but they're really not doing it they're not doing it like i'm able to do with it that should be your comfort that people by far and large humans are lazy creatures okay they're lazy and they're not going to be predominantly rule-based disciplined responsible they're gonna be lazy and they're not gonna do what's supposed to be done so it won't change anything okay it won't make these things inferior it won't change their superiority it will not make them ineffective they will remain constant now the algorithm i don't care how many people learn from this youtube channel okay i don't care how many people rip me off and try to rebrand and change the name of everything i've taught all of that saturation will not change because what i just said the algorithm isn't going to change there's new suckers coming in all the time pt barnum said it really really accurately there's a sucker born every second so they're you're never going to run out of liquidity somebody's born somebody gets old enough to start speculating and trading boom they're in the marketplace and that liquidity will just add to the liquidity that will be on the other side of your tree so there's no reason for you to be worrying about whether or not this is going to be in effect i've been teaching this for a long time okay privately and listen if i honestly believed in my heart of hearts that this would fail and stop working if i taught it i would not teach it i wouldn't i would have never even mentioned it and i'm being honest so take heart there's no reason for you to be upset about or worried or concerned it will remain as long as those markets are trading these elements will be in these markets there it is all right so the market rallies up it's stats above the order block here but it's just the wick see that the bulk of the volume and the bodies of the candles are inside that order block then the market does what it breaks and shows displacement here remember what i said about this pattern here relative equal lows it breaks down and it goes back to a fair value got here it is again relative equal lows displacement fair value got what does it do go right back up into what the fair value got end and look closely at the bottom of the bearish shoulder block see that bam hits it you watch me looking at the chart it's there and then i'm entering on that candle i'm not entering it because i wasn't really looking at the screen it's a second when i was i was holding the phone this morning but i wasn't looking at it here because this is a one-minute chart and i was doing something else and when i looked back at the screen i seen it went up there and hit it and after it filled it then i put my market over to go in and sell two i sold three contracts here i sold two contracts here and then i entered again here after it did what retraded back up into this bearish order block here so it moved down came back up in and i'm selling short here there okay what's the low on that candle right here look at this figure right there so 13 334 and three quarters and my entry as it ran up into it on this candle the entry was thirteen thousand three thirty five so it was only a quarter of a point above into that candle that was my entry it had a little bit of heat here so on that entry it was one contract here so notice what i'm doing i'm entering at the largest portion of the setup or you know the framework for the trade i'm going in with my maximum position size first three contracts there then selling two here and then i'm adding the last one here at logical precise areas it's not randomness it's not willy-nilly it's this not flipping a coin it's not guessing there's logic here okay so when the market has this heat on it here the highest value that candle goes to is thirteen thousand three hundred and thirty nine and a half so four and a half handles that's the heat i took on that there but only on one contract okay because i have two contracts that i'm short from back here and i have three contracts short from over here so i have all this built in equity with five contracts so the one contract here that only has four and a half points of heat on it or draw down it's insignificant i don't even worry about i'm not thinking about it and that's why i when i pyramid and i build in large positions i'm starting with my biggest position first and then i'm going smaller and smaller until i can't do any smaller i don't ever do the final one contract and do one more and one more and one more i don't do that that's i don't need to do that so once i had that position established then i submitted to the idea of it going down to that level that i drew out on the i forgot what time frame was now but we'll draw back out in a second but here is the exit here i bought all six back at 13285 even i want to be just above the level because it might do these little shallow runs and it might not give me my fill it does a little bit of that in here and then finally digs a little bit deeper i just thought i had to wait a little bit longer to get the fill but it happened right there and i posted on the community tab when it happened boom and showed you the little screenshot there it is now that's reading the tape that is reading the market that's getting familiar with order flow and for those of you that are students of mine for a longer time than just recently you recognize this as a market maker cell model so i was selling in an area where distribution would take place so all this stuff is there it's logic i'm going to say this point because i know there's people out there going through my trade statements and you're looking for precision uh there's a lot of things that i'm doing in that state in those statements that have nothing to do with trying to be precise you guys wanted to see an account go up i i provided that i also provided a way for my students they were asking me that i'm obligated to to show them where if they went into a period of drawdown how they fix it and also had lots of questions like and i did it this morning with let me see where was the entry yet the second one where i did two contracts right there okay when i did that one it was after i did the or was it let me go back and well does that make a difference the one where i had the fair value gap i said i didn't see it when it was forming and filling it in after it filled it it was still close to it so it was a close proximity entry a lot of the trades in that td ameritrade account i'm using close proximity entries and i'm also using things that you don't know about okay i'm also proving to some of my students where if they got into a marketplace and they take a trade and they don't get stopped out but they sit through draw down how the weather that you are not privy to the conversations i'm having with these students so don't assume that you're looking at those statements thinking oh this is this is all he's got that's not all i got i'm actually doing something else i hear somebody out there talking saying they can do things and i can't trade and i'm baiting them i want them to step out but they won't okay i want them to think that that's all i could do and even then they wouldn't butts because he knows i can do better than that this is this is not even the best there's other things you can do with my concepts right from this youtube channel that's more precise than this i know it sounds hard to believe but it is what it is i don't want those statements that i was sharing because like everything else of mine people take my stuff remove my name rebrand it and they say you know this is my stuff this is my creation this is whatever and they sell and they scam if i give statements that have real time and sales with live account and i'm producing like you see here is it hard to imagine someone taking that and showing it to people and saying that's their results and scamming them think about it folks everything i do there's a rhyming reason for it i'm not reacting to someone else's negative discord so today this is the last bit of business here and we're done so i did all this overnight going into a pre-new york session then we had all this back and forth they pumped it up over the overnight high here and then we go back into that discussion we had earlier so they ran the high here with this run up and at 9 30 that's when we expect that volatility to come in and that's right here okay so a little bit of whipsaw in here boom rallies in my live trading account i took a long in here and i got out at uh i think it was 13 409 i wanted 13 4 25 but i was a little apprehensive thinking that they may not stab through it they were getting real close to it and it's hung around and i got out just a little bit prematurely and that was it and i didn't take anything until later on the afternoon so a small little scalp in here made about 740 bucks i think it was and uh that was it my attention diverted because i'm mr mom right now not my wife's not with me and the two children i have that live with us still i'm in charge of homeschooling them still and running this business and i have two boxers that are highly demanding of my time and i know some of you are saying get to the point get your point the point is i'm a real person okay so i'm not able to be in every single move because i'm doing other things and i have a life i know it seems like i probably don't but i really do and as introverted as it is and is as simple as it is i love my life and i like doing the things i like doing in my life but the markets are not everything in my life but hopefully you got something out of this and you can see how we did again uh draw lower on nasdaq and i think that will be it for this one i'm going to go back to e-minis to p and you can see your relationship there so both of them moving in concert both of them moving in tandem but look closer okay this is why i went back to the e-mini s p why'd you do that ict do you see that look at the high here at uh two o'clock in the morning 2 30 in the morning today friday april 29th 2022. the rally here after 8 30 it creates the high but it's lower than the high it took 2 30 overnight i'll go back to nasdaq see that 235 and we have a higher run on nasdaq so this is what i teach is smt okay it's showing it's showing a willingness to correct the correlation between like markets these are closely correlated assets the s p 500 stocks composite and in nasdaq 100 stocks composite they generally move together in tandem not all the time so if we're bearish and we're expecting lower prices and we see this but the s p doesn't do it that's showing you that this is a stop run and it shows that s p is really weak so this gives you confirmation without using an indicator okay without having anything on the chart it shows you oh well let me just do it here when you have the nas back up like this you can do a comparing contrast by hitting this little tab here and we're going to add this e-mini s p new pane so it plots it below and then if you're comparing highs you want to go over here good little gear price source you want to change that to high and you can see high to high high to high higher here lower there so it looks like it looks like a divergence you see that with an indicator but it's not an indicator it's price so i use intermarket relationships and correlation and correlation used properly there's a lot of people that are talking about correlation they have no idea what they're talking about but if you look at the idea of this relationship here it gives you like an x-ray view of real accumulation and distribution this is distribution because it doesn't see the same rally higher that the nasdaq did okay there was two other things on my agenda here i mentioned to one of the young ladies i would show the fib this is nothing else so you guys are all welcome to turn the video off because this is not going to be teaching really anything it's for those individuals that just want to calibrate their fibonacci and also some of the little points that i add to the chart and i'll show you how that means here price note had someone asked me how do i put those little annotations on um just anchor to the high you want drag it over if you hold down the shift button it'll make it level you can also do that with your trend lines so if you want to add here if you start dragging it if you put the shift button it'll automatically toggle it and keep it straight and so many of my students were so helpful because it used to drive me crazy so anyway i know i told you i warned you folks it's not going to be arm burners it's simple stuff for people that are new all right um the last bit of business is the fibonacci okay so i'm going to anchor your fib to two price points me get this off here all right so once you have it on your chart highlight it and then go over to the little gear and go to style and style these are the settings okay all you do is go in click the little box here type in the numbers you see just like i have here now if you want to see projections on how far down or up the moose will likely go this is for equilibrium so if you want to see discount the premium that's what the 0.5 level is it's 50 and you can see by having this on here it starts doing standard deviations okay and if you want to calibrate it to the daily range here it'll give you a pretty good idea of where your low should form now this was a little bit excited because it went below an important low but that's enough for government work if you want to show optimal trade entry levels and you're pulling the fill up i'm just taking this off so that way your attention is right on the levels that make up optimal trade trade entry rather the 62 and the 79 okay and you can change these make them a different color to stand out i don't like to do that but you can see it here so if we were looking at it like this here's the optimal trade entry levels and it trades up into it here let me zoom in can you zoom in itt i young like you are all right so here's the high to the low optimal trade entry and trades up into it here and into the fair value got bam that's what makes it optimal so there's your entry here and you can start going back in and we can do the projections here again go into it now move this out of the way do one standard deviation two standard deviation one half standard deviation and i think that's enough for this one so the range from the high and the low you can get that for your discount the premium but for optimal trade entry i like to use the bodies lowest open or close in the swings and you can see how nice that gets right up almost into the 79 percent tracing let me see that i'm going to take this sphere there you go line off you can see how yeah it cleans it up are you saying what the book say is you don't know how to use a fibonacci you have any idea how many people have said that over the years they actually made videos about me on youtube saying that stuff look at this i don't understand what he's doing it's the bulk of the volume i'm using the lowest opening on this candle here inside this swing and inside this swing i'm using the highest open or close and that's what's being plotted on optimal trade entries here i look at this as stop running just like this is i want to get to the heart of the matter okay i'm getting to the point this is extra for the people that didn't want to stay so the optimal trade entry level here now if we start looking at the projections down here we have one standard deviation down here project up over here boom see that hits it and then we have a nice retracement up so this is a good area to take profits here and it's also below the low so how far can i go below this low ict well there's a standard deviation right there and it does so handsomely then we have a nice little retracement then it gets wild right before the opening okay but that's the things i promised it would be at the end of this video that was supposed to be on thursday and i appreciate you guys being you know patient not going all crazy in pitchfork and you know torches you said you were gonna do a video on thursday real life kicked in folks all right and i think that my friends is going to be it and i will touch base with you lord willing on tuesday of next week until i'll talk to you then enjoy weekend and be safe

all right folks and take a look at the e-mini micro nasdaq 100 index and i'll show you the imbalance we're in here this is the initial one you can always imagine it could stab up into the second one which it's really a sense it's just done now so that could be a cell i'd like to see it come down here first now outline this as i go this is kind of like the end of the road for the drop down before it runs tuesday's highs that's what i'm thinking this is fomc i'm waited a few minutes for it to do its initial shakeout so this is the end of the race lower that's the little checkered flag here notice i have that so it's not like me talking after the fact you can see i'm doing everything here there's where we're looking for it to drop down in and run out the tuesday highs that i was mentioning on my community post so we're looking for the trade down in there now it could sweep a little bit below that because to the left of that imbalance that i'm highlighting in turquoise there's a cell side of the pretty pool resting just below it but for now i'm just focusing there so it could drop down into that level now there's a couple ways to use this information you can do a trade here with your demo account compliance reasons and look for it to run out the short term low and or wait for it to potentially trade up into the higher time frame fair value gap and the reason why you could potentially wait for that is because it's fomc it has like a knee-jerk reaction kind of like non-farm payroll there's a initial leg then another leg then like a fake out leg and then a real setup comes which is what i'm outlining here in that blue shaded area so i'm noticing that it's likely to draw down here so i'm drawing this outside we can see the diagram is dropping okay the idea is to drop down here first is the quick move i'm looking for then the run through tuesday's high all right so it should start dropping in here i don't want to see it go too much more than that because that would upset the fair value you got that is not yet traded into i think that's going to be the the next real drop so right here's where i'm thinking initially there's cell side resting right below that low so you could be a short here and your stop would be right above that most recent green candle to the left of where we're right now and you can see there's no replay button being used here the candles are painting the replay button is dim it's not even a thing with me that's not true now is it i did recently in the mentorship video use the replay button but i felt awkward and i just wanted to do it just to be funny so here is the drop down in here now i can revisit the bottom and under that fair value gap and bump it kind of like a support resistance idea and that would be a shorting opportunity if it were to do that and again this thought would be placed at the high of the most recent green candle to the left right there see that that's a short right there okay the market is likely to keep dropping in here i'm looking for that little bullseye that blew bull's-eye right below that short-term low and that blue line if you notice when i first started the recording here that was really just an order block so it could bounce there a little bit but ultimately my interest is from where we are now down into that checkered flag area and it doesn't look like i got enough room so i'm gonna probably have to move that over to the right a little bit and again the mindset is we're dropping down okay even though it's it really initially just ran the tuesday high but it's done shallow okay the vocabulary i'm using here is running the tuesday high not sweeping the tuesday high the difference between sweeping would be like what it's done here that will be a sweep that's a real shallow little run above that red line that's tuesday's high okay so it swept that and we're coming back down post fomc so kind of like look at this move here we're making and if it can drop down to that blue shaded area it might just if i'm wrong it might just go down to that little bull's eye and then run higher from there i'm hoping it doesn't do that i want to see it trade down into that blue shaded area a little checkered flag is because that's like the end of the race for bears they get into that then it should start the real move higher running tuesday high running tuesday's high means it runs right over top of it and it just doesn't look back sweeping is where it just goes above or below a low or high you know i mean like if we're going to sweep by side that means it's going to go up a little bit and then go down and reverse okay if i'm saying we're going to run an old high for relative equal highs that means we're going to run through it and continue so that way there's a little bit of an understanding here what i'm saying when i say that i try to pick my words carefully so that way you understand the distinction between what i'm expecting as a sweep and reverse back into the range or expansion move where i think if we can get down here and i'm going to scrub this over because you can see we're getting running out of space here it might take a little bit more candles than i first thought oh let me get this back here there we are oh there it is this thing i'm telling you i look like a noob i see these are new all right so we'll see if we can drop down into that and i had to make another video for my mentorship group so i got to get started on that one so here's a bearish order block it can come back and hit that and resume going lower all right not bad not bad let's see if she loves me you can see no replay button everything's dynamic here all right about to run into that cell side liquidity pool just anchor this here so we can see visually when it drops below it change the color here's a little bit lighter than that one oops too light okay that's good enough that way you can see it i'll take this off here all right and there you go now i'll come back to this in a moment all right as you can see the market did in fact trade down look at the bodies of the candles respecting that blue shaded area really really handsome price delivery and it dipped down a little bit below but that's fine i'm not worried about being that accurate the main thing is going down into that area it turns and then runs tuesday's high look how much more dynamic that is now what i did was i took the low at the turn after it made it to run into that little blue shaded area once it started rallying and it took out the swing high around that thirteen thousand six i'm sorry thirteen thousand one fifty basically crossed back over where the fair value gap is the larger one that drop down into once it trades above that then i'm gonna use the high initially at the 2 o'clock hour down to the low post 230 that range i'm using the fibonacci to expand up to a target and it came up to 13437 even i'm just waiting for it to hit that and once it does then i'll go into the fibonacci and i'll show you you know what this looked like how i measured it and all that but hopefully you can see that it's done the majority of the move which was outlined on the community tab before i obviously did the video i did the video here you know marking it up that we can see it wasn't a replay thing it wasn't something after the fact it's something that i'm teaching you all here now the question mark at the bottom lower left hand corner what that is anchoring is the high that was formed at two o'clock or what would be shown is 1400 here on the chart down to that low where the question mark is so what you're doing is you're going to get measurement of the range okay where's 50 of that below 50 is where that fair value gap is that's in turquoise so that's the target it's dropping down into it so it's a matter of looking at this and really there's technically oh there's one two three four five six seven eight there's eight trades in this this whole entire thing so um once it trades this level here i'm looking forward to hit that and then i'll go in and kind of show you some things about what i'm referring to that as the eight setups and this might not be the real setup that you would be looking for it might be something one of the eight that i'll show you but that's the unique idea that i want you to adopt as a student of mine i don't want you all thinking well we all have to have the same setup no you don't have to have the same setup in fact you're not you're going to come to the conclusion that you know the things that you're looking for are going to be much more important when it's uniquely selected not me pushing you into a mode saying this is how it's going to work every single time just for you because it's not going to work that way so you have to find a way to grow comfortable with the concepts and how that applies to the present market conditions and how you select your setup and i'll show you eight of them in here that way you'll know that this is what you're looking for and it fits your criteria and you may not take any of the other seven out of the eight but the main one here is obviously the one i highlighted it's the one that is the highest form of analysis that we can see exactly where it's going to draw to before it turns around so you can couple what i've shown you here with what i've out outright came and told you basically that i'm looking for the drop down at fomc at two o'clock once it drops down into that usually around 2 30 it finished its initial leg where it prices in whatever it's going to do either high or low and then starts to rally so you can see it's pretty much close to that in terms of algorithmic delivery just a little bit past 2 30. we're about ready to hit that target here and there she is all right so let's dim that out and i'll take you over to the fib portion and i'll explain everything to you that way all right so now obviously i'm going to take you back in i'm going to use the fib here and what i'm doing is anchoring it to the high down to the low now this is the most extreme now usually i'll use the highest open or close and the lowest opener close in the price swing when it's not expected to have a whole lot of volatility because it's the fomc it's more likely to be much more volatile that means the extreme of the ranges should be considered that means now i'm going to use the wix you get asked a lot all the time you know in the comments like you know why does itc use the wix and why does he use the bodies and what does he differentiate i just taught you okay so i'll show you two forms of that and actually i'm gonna do this backwards didn't i yep i did i'm going to draw it from the low up to the high i'm looking for upside objectives okay so low up to high here's one objective here's two objectives and now we're just falling short of that one okay so that's kind of the extreme target for me today but if you look at the body to body it'll make a whole lot more sense in a moment there's that target i was looking for right there in the earlier portion of the recording okay very very gap initial one here drops down hits the order block which is that blue line here it bounced up into the fair value got this is what i was suggesting this is going to be the mean one so let's see run on liquidity drop down start to drop even lower hit an order block then rallies up hits the fair value gap that sets the stage for the decline down into the area i highlighted in advance said this was the end of the road for the bears it starts to rally comes back down in rallies once more takes off takes out tuesday's high much more meaningfully and rallies again pulls back into an imbalance here rallies again pulls back into an imbalance here after taking our target and even continues to go higher from there okay so let's take a look at some of the trades you got the run here ahead of fomc that i would not count okay that's that's a setup but that's a gambler's setup before the fomc announcement so we have the drop down then the fair value gap here so that's trade one the return back to the fair bag up here that's tree two drops down in below here you would close your short if it's a scalp here is a long idea as a scalp to take us up into i said look what you're resting above this high here and then into the fair value that says the short down into the objective i was looking for now right away some of you are thinking man i'm not spiderman how do you expect me to take all these trades i'm not folks i'm not any one of these things that i'm outlining here could be a specific setup that fits your unique model okay that meets the criteria that you're looking for then it drops down here that's a buy and you can share this here as an order block there rallies up and it comes back down into the order block these two down closed candles here because now this is where i said we were going to turn and i said that we're going to run tuesday's highs now sweep them like this it's going to run them okay so we ran right over top of them here so it rallies up comes back down in retracement rallies again small little imbalance you can be a buyer there rallies and again here this is one that i didn't obviously mention or you see because i stopped recording as it ran through here on our objective okay and i think that is going to be it so i i don't want you thinking this is an invitation for you to try to trade fomc or like a non-farm payroll event they're very very risky extremely risky but they're really fun to go back into and study from a hindsight perspective or if you can watch it live it's a wonderful case study that we can look at how liquidity is taken how it runs to the other extreme of the range and how it starts to deliver institutional order flow all down close candles should be supporting price as it goes up and running out to stays high in a much more meaningful manner hopefully you found this one insightful until next time be safe you

all right folks welcome back this is going to be episode 24 of the continuing series of the free ict mentorship on youtube for 2022. all right so i want to kind of like sit you down for a minute get your attention because if you don't have the proper mindset for this one this could be taken out of context and viewed in the light that is not really my aim okay so i want you to think about why are you even watching these videos are you trying to learn are you just entertaining yourself or are you here to try to be disruptive because if you're trying to be disruptive i don't have any time for that so i want you to understand what i'm going to show in this video this is not going to be a repeating theme i just want to let the foundation be laid here if i see any comments that are either disrespectful or just meant to stir up chaos and and create a ruckus i'm just gonna ban you from the town and your post won't appear okay the comment section is open you guys said i don't open the comments up i've been opening them up all the mentorship videos are open okay i use your comments to steer the future direction of the lessons i try to incorporate things that you may have asked or shown a concern about respectfully if this is not for you then obviously you can go watch tom dick and harry go play in market replay okay that's fine but here i'm teaching you things that actually work in the live markets i'm not pulling some strings that to make you feel like you you're learning something that is a gimmick this is real market delivery those of you that are really sincere about learning obviously you have a lot of work ahead of you and we are in the development stages early on in this mentorship so that means you have to understand that this is the discovery where you see this pattern you're supposed to be going back through the data in your old charts not trading not even demo trading okay you're looking for this pattern through back testing now some of you have asked to do a back testing episode i will do a back testing episode okay but i want you to understand you have to have the proper mindset here you have to be responsible you have to be attentive and you have to listen so the things i'm teaching the things i'm saying suggesting to you you have to make them applicable to your own journey you can't just watch and think okay i've seen him do this a few times in a video i understand it so i'm gonna go out there and try to do it so i i want you to understand in light of that idea or direction that some of you want to take just know that that's not the proper way of doing it okay so some of you are unaware that this is the other part of the ict experience so when i'm communicating to community here not only am i doing it in the comment section very very rarely but i also talk on the community posts and if you go on the youtube go to my youtube channel and click on this little area right here you'll see it it's kind of like my twitter like my update area sometimes i'll prompt you to look at certain charts or i'll encourage you give you ideas to think about you know where you are in your journey and sometimes i'll share a youtube channel for a specific video it's not meant for you to be able to talk to me here but you can obviously say anything you want in the comment section just know that if it's something that's disrespectful you can say whatever you want on your last post okay because i'll just make you invisible you won't be here anymore and you can keep creating accounts and i don't care it just takes one little click of a button for me you got to go through the whole overcoming row of email addresses and all that business and you know i don't get tired of clicking hitting ban i don't get tired of doing it it's really easy in fact it's fun but this area here is the other segment of the mentorship so with that in mind i made this post a little while ago and today's date is may 5th 2022 and i know some of you try to remind me to make these posts with the date and i just don't i don't remember it so i'm used to doing twitter and twitter used to do a time and date stamp all the time it's just i'm a creature of habit like anybody else i don't really think about it when i'm doing it but i made this post this morning i said good morning constant reader i know right that fomc was pretty neat huh now try this one open your nasdaq 15-minute chart and e-mini s p 15-minute charts drop a horizontal line across those smooth criminal highs in both index i'll explain what that is in a moment see how we dropped into a discount overnight study how they treat those relative equal highs today and non-farm payroll friday as you were so i'm encouraging all of you to open up your charts and interact okay because some of you just want to watch my videos and that's it and think it's going to translate from just watching and then now you know how to do it no you got to get in and study it so i prompted everyone to look at their chart this is kind of like what i was drawing your attention to now as one caveat here that little blue arrow that is me drawing the specific so that way we know what we're talking about here where my attention was really drawn in on this i'm watching this i got that little bubble there that little gap right there i'm watching and i'm waiting for that to drop down at 9 30. that's that little judas swing okay i'm waiting for that judas swing to happen where it drops down at 9 30. if it goes into that area there and then it creates displacement then it looks for a fair value guy and if it trades back down into a fair value gap inside that displacement then i can go long and i'll look for a run into that 4303 okay i did not tell my mentorship last night that i wanted to do this very thing here but if i was going to tell my mentorship anything this is what i would have said okay i would like to see it drop down into that area and then create the model that i'm teaching here on the youtube channel now read what it says here it says you are studying this and i am watching this okay pray tell does this in any manner whatsoever suggest in any manner at all that any of you should be buying or selling this no it doesn't for years i've been asked to do live sessions i've been asked to trade live in front of people okay the number one reason why i have refrained from doing it is what we're going to talk about next because responsibility is lacking predominantly across all countries all age and demographics it's simply something that most people in trading lack okay now it's going to be very easy for me to sit in front of a chart and say this is what i think is going to happen i think it might go up to this level or go down to that level that is not a trade idea that's just bias it's logic that's the extent that's the extent of what i'm gonna do in the live sessions the reason why i already said that in the beginning and i didn't change gears because of what i'm gonna talk about tonight but this is important okay mindset is absolutely crucial if you young guys and gals in here are already bored do yourself a favor turn this video off don't ever watch another video by me because you're going to cheat yourself from the absolute best prevention of ruin if you continuously try to just watch my videos pay intermittent attention and then think you're going to glean any real understanding because this is highly technical i have simplified it and you're going to see two very simplified approaches to what i'm trying to teach so that way i can get right to the point but these are the parts that cause people that don't want to listen they don't want to pay the attention to the things i'm teaching you these are the parts that will hurt you if you don't understand it do you want to succeed because to succeed you need this part not the little patterns not the little things i can draw on a chart that stuff that's the smallest part of it how you think about yourself what you think you're capable of doing and the management and observation and respect of risk is going to determine what your success is going to be i wish i could grab you by your lapels and just shake you and say listen this is the part you need to learn it's not full of lamborghinis it's not full of patek philippe watches and flossing in front of everybody i talk to you this way because i genuinely care about your success that's all that's all i want you to be able to do is take this information the logic and do well with it i'm not trying to bore you or burn through minutes just for the sake of hearing myself talk i want you to understand and some of you simply don't want to listen have to be a critical thinker i'm training you to be a critical thinker i'm going to give you two examples tonight of what critical thinking is not all right this individual here it was in the comment section okay and this is the poster child for why i do not sit in front of people and trade with entry stop targets i don't do that because invariably someone's going to take something i'm doing or saying or applying to a chart and they're going to do something with live funds and they're going to come out and say just lost a thousand thanks a lot now i don't know who this person is this person may not have actually taken a trade and lost money this person may be a troll this person may be a genuinely sincere individual at this point i don't care but i want to highlight this is the very thing folks this is it this is the thing that prevented me all these years to sit in front of all of you and entertain you with trading because someone's going to do something and when they do something by their own actions and it's painful for them if they lose money guess whose fault that is because it's not mine it's the person that lost the money listen everything i teach here is under the guise of demo and paper trading that's compliance i don't give trade advice i can talk about where the market's going to go i can give my opinion about that market opinions that's not trade advice it's the same logic the same idea in the same language that all of my paid mentorship students sign an agreement and they give me indemnity they know going in that everything i'm saying is under the pretense of demo and paper trading and you can't make money with demo trading but guess what you can't do either you can't lose money either so it gives you that freedom to think about what you're doing without the tug of war of making and losing money some of you in here are so high strung and so impatient that you just want to go out there and say okay i'm going to watch this video i'm going to get a hint from ict like i'm giving you some kind of secret language for signal service and i say this stuff to my own paid mentorship i said it for six years every time there was a new group coming in they know there is no new group coming in and stop listening to these yahoos out there saying that i'm gonna start another mentorship and i'm gonna sell i'm not selling no more mentorships folks because of this kind of stuff okay i'm not doing it so whether this person lost a thousand dollars or didn't i don't care that right there is why i have prevented myself saying no i'm not going to do it because i know there's going to be a lot of you out here that are going to hurt yourself because you're not ready none of you should be trading this model with live funds we haven't even gotten through all of the content or the the process of what it is you're doing with it today you're getting another piece of it but this is the crucial part this is the stuff the boring stuff the things that you don't want to listen to the things that you want to go through the people that want to come in here later on and say here's a minute marker when he starts really teaching and you want to avoid the crap i will delete your posts if you do stuff like that it's disrespectful not only to me but the other viewers because you're really taking their attention away from what is the real lesson you're all entitled to your opinion but if your opinion is disruptive or disrespectful i won't let it post now you can disagree respectfully and those posts stay on the comment section but nonsense that's meant to start a ruckus your channel will be blocked then you have folks like this who cannot be taught now again this could be a troll this could be someone that didn't really take a trade today because really the logic as i'm going to prove tonight really wasn't in the marketplace today for this model and it can't be argued there's no way you're going to be able to say that what i posted this morning is lined up with any of the logic that this model uses so again this person may have done something foolish or maybe they're just here to troll that's fine it doesn't matter because the posts that were made even after this indicate that the person's really not properly prepared to learn how to do this and or really not interested in learning so they're going to get removed they may come back in another form but any disrespectful comment will be removed this statement right down here at the bottom highlighted take accountability for your actions if you're taking trades number one you gotta take it you gotta take accountability for your actions those are your actions i didn't reach through the screen i didn't go to your house i didn't go to your apartment i didn't meet you at your job and press your cell phone to get you into a trade in fact i didn't tell you anybody about a trade i said study watch i'm watching this okay that is not indications that's not instructions to buy or sell anything so don't get caught up in all this frenzy to be pushing any buttons yet because none of you know what you're doing all right i appreciate your patience getting through that how to get it off my chest and i promise i won't do it again because it's already been done here just know that if you act like those individuals i won't see your posts all right so may s p we won't cover tonight but it's kind of similar to what this is showing here but the e-mini nasdaq 100 features june contract delivery month 2022 this is a daily chart and i felt that this morning we could have popped through stabbed above these relative equal highs right in here and then created this run lower that's kind of like what i was prompting study that because if it happens you can see and study and back test now that the market's already moved you can go back in and look and see if the model in fact did what i teach now this is actually a good lesson because it shows where i'm looking for something to form but it doesn't form it doesn't create a losing trade it doesn't get me into something that causes me to buy it when there really isn't an entry pattern there this is the proof the evidence that the model has validity so if you have a valid reasonable sound logic behind the model whatever model that is then it should prevent you from taking bad trades not all the time but sometimes when there is a really big move going the other direction that you don't see or expect it may do its job and keep you from getting into those bad traits and i'll show you the logic here today i want you to be a critical thinker okay think about what i've already taught about this model in the comment section below if you think that this model appeared based on what i showed in that community post say so if you don't think that this model appeared based on what i showed then say so as well also i'd appreciate if you would include in your post where are you all from folks like i want to get like a a broad range view of how far i'm reaching i know i got a lot of people in different countries but all you just tell me what country you're from you don't have to be specific with your address or social security number i'm not that interested but i would like to know you know where everyone's from but here's the logic with that one hour chart and that relative equal high so this is the framework i'm looking for a run above here if it can get above that then what it could wash out and go lower why would that be possible in terms of a pattern or a setup or the logic what would be the catalyst for that what like what was the reasoning for you being interested in these relative equal highs number one it's thursday it's thursday and it's ahead of non-farm payroll friday now nine farm payroll friday is usually a volatile day it can be messy it can be sloppy sometimes it's just a really just a dud it doesn't really do anything other days it could be extremely volatile like the fomc but because fomc has done what it's done i don't think that the non-farm payroll numbers is going to have that much impact but i was looking for these relative equal highs to be taken out then drop lower than create the model that i'm teaching so that's why it's kind of drawing your attention to them so that way if it did present that you can have something to study now what's the catalyst that sets the run up into those relative equal highs i'm going to talk about that now much like i was suggesting in that post we had dropped down into a discount i posted ahead of the 9 30 opening where equities open up and that volatility that comes around 9 30 i want to see some kind of a manipulation in price so if our focus and i was trying to get your attention up here if our focus is up there and it's dropping down and it's ahead of 9 30 what are we likely to see drop down get traders thinking it's going to go lower and then rally up not just go down indiscriminately and then go higher it's got to do something specific i'm interested in this area right here that's what i posted in that community post saying i'm watching this and that was that little area right here for all of these videos that i've been posting it's very specific i'm teaching fair value that that fair value gap is right there okay so dropping down into that that would be a point of interest for me so that i can go in and look for something that gives me my setup so in other words this here is just where the trade might form hear what i just said where the trade might it could it may not it's absolutely going to this is a promise there's no way this can fail because that logic doesn't exist in trading except for over leverage and over trade you're gonna blow your account that's a guarantee okay but that fair value gap that's the place in terms of price where should the pattern form by itself it's just price but we have to incorporate what element first algorithmically it's time so i'm teaching you elements of time at that 9 30. we're expecting some volatility dropping down into that area here which at this point at the chart it doesn't do yet so i'm looking for it to drop down into that area if it does then i'm going to be looking for what i teach you in this model so with that area shaded right here this is a 15 minute chart you can see we traded down into it the candle stopped right at the old candle high and the next candle just gave up the ghost right away we should notice that we did have the initial criteria which is trading below an old low so what's going to be resting below that cell stops so they go down run out the sell stops traders are caught in then what what's the next logic we got to look for displacement it's got to trade back above this old low it's got to have displacement above that did it happen here no here is a five minute chart now if you're looking at this with that same low here it trades down below it did we get displacement above that oh low no it just went down consolidated returned back to it but melted didn't do anything above that oh low there was no displacement no energetic move so that way you can look for a fair value gap to trade back down into the buy so anyone that would have looked at this and bought today is not using what i'm teaching they're just impulsively pushing a button and if they lost money you have to fault yourself for that i'm not the good i'm not going to be the target for all of you that fail don't listen and want to gamble and when it doesn't work for you because you took a guess you took a stab at it you just wanted to see what was going to happen and you lose money you can never do that with me even my paid mentorships those students they can't do any of that either because i never tell them to go into anything and buy or sell anything nothing i'm not going to co-sign your financial ruin it ain't going to happen none of this can be placed on me the responsibility is solely on you the viewer and it's a lot of responsibility and some of you simply are not going to be able to do this not because it doesn't work but because you are not responsible you don't have any self-control you don't want to listen you don't want to have any rules in those rules look at it like this folks in the videos i'll suggest folks hey look pause the video here study it so that way you can really look for it before it's revealed there's a lot of people they make jokes and say i'm not going to pull i'm not going to pause the video i promise you if they're sincere in their response saying that i promise you they will not learn this okay it will not happen because they're showing a a trait that is simply not conducive for success in doing this business so it doesn't work like that it's not easy it's not netflix and chill it's ict and study your ass off okay that's the way it is and it takes a lot of logic that you have to adhere to and you have to break yourself there's a lot of things you're going to try to do impulsively if you do them here and it works for you you make profits you're going to be in here in the comments section high fiving me yeah we're killing ict style when in fact you just got lucky because then the next time you take another trade impulsively you're going to want to fault me you're going to say you weren't around when i posted that comment this morning i spent the day with my wife i haven't seen her for a week and i'm not obligated to babysit anybody through a community post i don't even do that with my mentorship that pay me okay so again it's all about responsibility and i'm placing the logic in your hands it's up to you to go through the charts see if it fits you if it doesn't fit you folks there's a lot of other ways to trade there's lots of ways to trade you don't need to trade my way okay i'm biased i believe mine's the best i believe i can outperform anybody in any style of trading and i can do it consistently will that translate to you no but i'm saying and promising that you're going to learn how to read price better than you ever imagined it's worth the investigation look into it see if it doesn't hold up but don't do things outside the rules i'm giving you and that's why i teach this way slow incremental pieces because invariably you're going to do things impulsively if you lack self-control if you don't have self-control you're going to blow up and folks listen there's nothing worse than thinking you understand something in a rush and then go out there and trade with live funds and blow the account it hurts it's painful it sucks and it's easy to say oh it's that guy that wasn't there to tell me what's really going on you know if he would have told me this or that i wouldn't have lost money no because i'm never putting any of my students in a position where they have to be handheld through a trade they're putting their self in that if they did it at all and they gotta get themselves out of it that teaches responsibility and you have to own those results good or bad they're yours and that's why i tell everybody when they find success in this and they like to say hey it was it was all credit to you ict you know without you i couldn't have done this wrong wrong the only thing i did was show you how to read price i did not sit with you and push a button so if you took on that risk if you sat through the learning and worked through all the back testing and studying and forward testing demoing and producing a track record that you can feel confident in then and only then with the time that you choose not when i say so because i never tell anybody with live funds in fact right now i'm reminded don't trade with life funds when you make that decision should you ever do so you've done it on your own accord so if you make money whose success really is that it's yours and it's well deserved never ever champion me for your success now you can thank me for helping you with the logic but i didn't help you make money and just this well i did not help you lose it either those buttons getting pushed you push them and you have to sleep with yourself knowing that that's the results that you provided and there it is you live with it and if it's a bad taste in your mouth swallow it's the way it is it's bitter medicine but it's good for you you'll learn from it or it'll take you out of the business and that might be the best thing for you if you can't stick to the rules this game has a funny way of taking you right out of it the people that are consistently profitable it's not by luck and they're not stupid they have a logic they adhere to they have rules that they trade with and they have to stick to them when they deviate from them or do something outside of what that role-based strategy is then it's reasonable to expect ruin or loss and those moments are most painful because you can look back and say this is not what i should have done that's what i shared that other guy corbs video about i'm sure he has a strategy but for whatever reason from his commentary he suggested that he just lost control of himself and started doing things that made no sense anybody that's ever traded with life funds knows exactly what that means if anybody has ever treated life funds they understand what that man was saying i know i've done it a lot in the 90s i know exactly what he was talking about but it feels like it's never going to work and you just want to pick yourself up you're going to have losing trades folks okay in your journal right now today with today's date make a promise to yourself write it out i promise that as long as i'm doing this i'm going to endure losses notice i said indoor you're not going to be defeated by those losses you're just going to have to endure them because trading is all about managing losing trades you got to trade your way out of a losing trade every single time you get into market every single trade as soon as you start off you're under the commission you're under the spread in forex you got to come out of that every trader is a losing trader that finds success out of loss or suffers ruin in it that's it that's the only two things that can happen all right so now let's talk a little bit about the model and give you a little bit more details and i probably feel like i beat you up and you're like man this is depressing this is not what i was hoping to hear i promise it was good stuff for you okay now i want to talk about where do these setups form so in your journal this is like a subtitle area for this video where do setups form okay think about that for a minute when you're looking for this idea that i'm sharing the fair value got where would you expect them to appear in price obviously i've been teaching you to run above an old high or relative equal highs and if you're bearish that would set up a scenario where the market goes up sweeps the highs breaks back down below the highs short-term lows taken out with displacement and then you go back through that displacement leg looking for a fair value guy to short into that's pretty simple logic isn't it well visually i want you to understand it okay so that way in your mind i do this exercise all the time with my students can you draw out with a diagram like if you were at work and you're trying to explain to your friend or co-worker what it is you're looking for in price now they're not going to understand what you're doing but how would you draw it out in price or in a napkin with a pen or pencil what would it look like well you have obviously a level of relative equal highs and we're just going to use that green line as an example of that and price is moving towards it small little correction or so it runs towards it again and then finally it runs through those relatively highs okay at that moment as soon as it goes above it you start panning back through all this price running here and find the nearest short term low because that right there is going to be your trigger it's not that it goes above this old relative equal high and then goes down below that that's not it folks that's not it you have to see it go below that and displacement with the energetic move take out a short term low that's how you filter out these trades that may not be high probability so that area right there as soon as you run above the relative equal highs in your mind you're looking for where's the trigger because until it takes out that short term low there's nothing going on there's no trade there there's no set up there then when there's displacement that displacement leg and price action that right there is your foundation to the setup that's it once you have that then you can go into that area and look for the fair value guy that's the logic that's the pattern that's what you're looking for this is if it's bearish now if those relative equal highs would have been traded through this morning i would have expected this scenario okay before it ran those relative equal highs i was looking for like down here price was trading down into that area i was showing you my interest today i'm watching this where it was likely to go down to this is kind of like the low in my mind i'm kind of using it as an example what i was expecting price to do once it got down into that fair value gap that i was saying i'm watching this that little arrow okay i showed that little gap i was expecting this type of movement to set up the run above those relative equal highs but there was no movement here to set up that run either so two scenarios that i would have loved to seen develop just did not pan out it just simply wasn't there now i'm going to teach you another approach and this is kind of like what i was expecting and had it panned out this morning if it would have gave the real setup which it did not i've already shown that that little fair value gap that i was waiting to see a response in it didn't do it just melted right through it but if it would have done this but this is going to be the cell version okay just reverse it for the going long idea if you have a old fair value gap above you okay so you have an old fair value you got and the market's below it and it's trading up and you're bearish but you think it's going to go up that fair value gap the same logic when it trades up to the relative equal highs once it trades into that fair value gap it doesn't have to completely close it if it trades up into it anywhere between here and here is good okay it trades above it you can really make it simple and say okay the low of the fair value got treat that like the same logic that you use for the relative equal highs doesn't that make it simple and easy that way you don't have to worry about how hard do i need to know you don't need to know that because you're waiting for something to happen what is that once it takes out the low of the fair value gap and trades in there you go back through that leg and see okay here's what there's that trigger that's that shift in the market structure you're waiting for then you have the displacement leg so once you have that you can go back in and look for the fairway okay so that's the two entry strategies for this model there's no other way of worrying about what does it look like this now visually this is what you're doing okay it's simple if it feels like it's not simple watch this part of the video a couple times and then go back and look at price action in live data and in old back testing go back and look at old moves and you'll see this logic is there okay it's algorithmic it repeats unfortunately today it didn't give me the setup to allow myself to sit down with you tonight and say okay this is what i did because i was going to trade it okay i was going to enter at the low run the highs go short and write it down that way too i was going to do it but nothing panned out it didn't mean that the models broke it doesn't mean that the models broke it doesn't mean that i can't find winning trades it just means that the market did not provide the structure to allow this to form does it result in a losing trade no because the logic wasn't utilized that would have put me in a losing trade it never formed this right here reverse the logic here apply it that's the homework apply this logic here does this appear in the fair value that i was drawing your attention to this morning on the community post no and no one can manipulate and say it was it just wasn't there folks so it's just a missed move and there's nothing you can do about it except for beat yourself up and say oh i wish i woulda coulda shoulda and that stuff doesn't make you money and it doesn't take any more money out of your pocket so don't do it don't waste time doing that it's toxic thinking so hopefully i don't need to bring up all this negativity anymore and address any of it like this because i'm never going to entertain it in a video again but i want to lay the foundation and provide my response to anybody that would think like this or say this whether they're trolling whether they are sincere whether they feel like they've been victimized okay you've done that to yourself if you pushed a button and you entered trade you did that nobody in this community including me chief of all of them never told you to buy or sell anything you're never going to have instructions where i'm telling you to buy or sell anything it's always going to be study this observe this watch this that's that's what i'm saying they're not code words for anything they're specific elements of study put your attention here watch and see observe is there any characteristics repeating with the logic that i teach that's not trading okay that's not trade advice that's not investing advice that's not money management advice it's just practicing reading price action and that's how i teach it might not be for you maybe you want me to drive around in lamborghinis and and lie to you about stupid stuff that ain't gonna work in the market that's just not what i'm gonna do that's not me i do things in the charts that make sense i teach it it's transferable knowledge but you have to be prepared to receive it study it practice it and endure all these times where you look for something to be there and it doesn't happen and then a move takes place that you've missed that's the test are you going to lose your mind because you missed a big move like today i used to do that when i was younger and it got me nowhere but backwards don't live in your losses missing moves is a loss taking a monetary loss in the market is a loss taking a demo trade that's a losing trade that's a loss the mental impact on that you have control over you can decide to amplify every bit of that or you can say you know what what can i take from this so that way i can never be hurt this much again by it because it will repeat but you have to be able to condition yourself so that way when these knocks and trips and falls and setbacks when they occur i've been here before that way it doesn't completely derail you that's an important lesson and unfortunately no one really touches that because they all pretend that they never make mistakes and they always catch the runs and i'm just not that kind of guy i'm honest i'm gonna tell you if that doesn't fit you again change the channel until next time be safe

all right folks welcome back this is our 25th episode of the free youtube ict mentorship for 2022 and i want to open this video up with a very brief monologue okay all right some of you are trying to scrub the video get past this part but bear with me just for a few moments please i want you to think about how i opened this mentorship up how i promised certain things i said you would learn specific logic that would repeat that it would be algorithmic it would look similar each time it does it there would be specific rules implied that you would have to follow and i taught on the basis of time and price so there's going to be things that obviously repeat with those themes but i want you to go into tonight's lesson with those promises in the forefront of your mind is what i'm teaching and has what i've been teaching exactly what i promised are you seeing it in the chart yourself now i'm not asking for a show of hands how many of you are profitable trading with live funds that's not what i'm saying here none of you should be trading with life funds with this you're all still learning it i'm reading some of the comments and some people are raising their hand up saying i just killed it today using what you thought made this much money blah blah blah i don't want you doing that okay because what you're doing is you're rushing in because you have a sugar rush you have a high right now because you're seeing things that make sense to you it resonates with you and that's great but don't be in a hurry to get out there and try to make money yet there's things like you'll see tonight that will help you still when you think you've already learned it you haven't and this is for the folks that are commenting in my videos saying that there are other people that'll teach what i'm teaching better and to the point nobody knows what i'm teaching i'm teaching this for the first time okay and you don't know the details behind what it is i'm teaching you don't know how far i'm going to take it and most of these guys don't even really trade so they sound like smart geniuses after the fact with market replay or old data and they have my vocabulary what i do is i call it before it happens i outline it why it should happen because that's proof of understanding the logic that that's understanding the algorithm i'm not implementing like i'm not putting anything in here with supply and demand and mr chris laurie can come here and tell me if i'm teaching or trading anything like him because i promise you none of this is found in his stuff period okay so when you see folks say this person teaches ict better than ict or more to the point really what they're saying is they truncate the concepts down to demonstrating hindsight so that way it makes them able to sell courses to the neophytes notice i'm not selling you anything i have already made millions of dollars i don't need to hold my hand out and ask you to pay my bills i do this because i love doing it i don't have a paypal i don't have a credit card swiper i don't have a cash app i don't do any of those things i do this because i love doing it and i am absolutely loving hannah fx or hannah 4x youtube channel because number one it's given me the female perspective and someone i think that is really trying to make a a go of it and i'm not concerned whether she really sticks with it long term and she may come to the conclusion that this is not worth it for her or it doesn't really jive it doesn't matter i'm interested in her development i'm interested in all of your developments obviously i can't follow every single person that follows me on youtube and some of you may be feeling slighted like why'd you pick her and not my channel please don't look at it that way understand it from a father's perspective because i look at all of you like my children even those that are older than me i try to teach you with the mindset that someone that has been through this longer than most of you if not all of you and i don't want to see you get hurt but i also have a daughter that i'm trying to inspire to do this on her own because i don't want her relying on another man to feed her to take care of her and i also want her to be able to break those lines of feeling comfortable because she's our daughter so i'm actively interested in this particular youtuber for the reason because i have a daughter that i'm trying to draw affinity with trading through her okay so it may not work but it's just me seeing how another young lady that is inspired to dig into these charts and understand what they're doing why they're doing what they're doing and hopefully that will inspire my daughter okay so for the folks that are emailing me and saying hey look can you follow me can you do this can you do that just understand that it's not my interest to try to you know sprinkle myself over everyone's channel because i think for the most part when i make an appearance in their comment section it's just like a rush of people coming in and like high-fiving me and you pray praising me in their comment section i don't like that i don't want to do that if you all would just refrain from doing it i'd probably comment more on other people's channels but i think it's rude okay i don't think it's appropriate and to those that i have made a appearance in their comment section and my friends and associates and students that have come behind and created like a circus environment around it apologize because that's not what i'm showing up for i'm going there because either i watched your video i felt that you gave something that was useful to the community or i just i just liked it so there's that so with all that let's get into the meat all right so we're looking at the e-mini s p futures june 2022 delivery contract price action for the daily chart now before i get into this please write this in your journal okay put your sandwich down and turn the tv off excuse yourself from your children and your spouse go in another room i promise rowling will be here for a couple minutes tonight everything i'm teaching you here works in forex okay it works in forex it's not limited to index futures please stop asking questions in the comment section that are answered if you just simply paid attention to the videos i've already produced okay maybe some of you just recently got to this and you came to this video first don't start here go back to the very first one okay now when we're looking at the daily chart i want you to think about what it is that i talked about before happening explained in great detail why it should take place and when the chart looked like this remember i was talking about how that specific order block was a catalyst for setting up a future move that shouldn't see the high of that candle pierced in other words that's the most unlikely level that's being here right here okay price should not go to and through that this is the most unlikely level to be traded to with a bearish order block now for some of you like oh can you teach order blocks i've already taught and introduced order blocks for some of you that are asking about order blocks watch my sniper series okay the scout sniper series it's in his youtube channel it's free i introduced the order block there and i'm also teaching more throughout the other series and specifically in this one now that's not the whole of this model it's not the secret sauce okay the fair value gap is what i'm trying to teach you to focus on because that small little area in price action that is the thing that is the easiest if i were to be asked simply what is it that's the easiest thing for a new trader to sit down and understand right away that's what this mentorship is this is somebody that has never traded before that doesn't really know a whole lot about technical analysis this is my introductory version of that uh there's a lot of people and hannah mentioned this before she doesn't believe that my concepts are for like the neophyte the brand new i went in with that mindset with this teaching series now obviously i'm not going to teach what a pip is i'm not going to teach you know how to calculate you know the smallest fluctuation in price because those things can be googled okay there's a there are obvious things that anyone can look up but the basic of basic understanding the time axis down here on the bottom and the price access up here and understanding how to find the time frames like this is a daily chart you can see that right here i work through trading view you may not want to use trading game maybe you use sierra charts maybe you use ninjatrader maybe you use tradestation two all those things or td ameritrade there's all these different brokers out there but what i want you to learn through and practice through is trading view okay you don't need to have a subscription to do what i'm showing you you don't need to pay for anything you'll see ads and it's okay but the bottom line is is i want you to look at the charts like this then you can segue into whatever your platform is and work with it there but understand learning the way i'm teaching you with this medium is the best way of doing it so with that understand that i mentioned that we would go into this area here not trade to the top of that candle and all this is mentioned in this mentorship series go back and watch those videos and i mentioned that we would draw down into here and into here so underneath that low here in these relative equal lows that's cell side liquidity what was the framework that led to me telling you that this was a bearish order block or watching that and that could set up a run into our may seasonal tendency now seasonal tendencies are times in a year where markets or specific asset classes will move generally not always not a hundred percent of time not absolutely never going to fail they historically have produced price swings that follow a seasonal tenancy that means they usually happen and one of the things i like to use as a i guess an analogy would be i live on the east coast of the united states so if i live in the east coast of the united states and i reside in maryland okay would it be reasonable for me to expect snow on the 4th of july no what's more likely sunny hot okay so that's the seasonal influence well that same influence not that specific not that that dramatic obviously but there are periods in the year where the markets have a tendency to do certain things may tends to be a month where the market in index futures and stocks they generally drop they go down i gave you that beforehand i explained it to you now i didn't give you the details about it but just understand going in every single year about the last week or so of april going into the month of may there's usually a tendency for these markets specifically the s p the nasdaq the dow the russell that group of markets tends to be weak not all the time but generally if you study go back through old data you'll see that's true now by itself it doesn't really mean much but in the hands of someone that's initiated with what i'm teaching you it is a road map to consistency you can practice and learn a lot about price action by doing this every single year going through old data and then you can forward test it going into next year and all the years after but what took place was we had these relative equal highs i mentioned this they took the buy stops or buy side liquidity out who's doing that smart money these individuals that go in and they sell to these buy stops when it's like this and at the same time when we're entering a period of time where there's a bearish seasonal tendency that means bearish prices lower expected going into may so we're seeing a run on liquidity here with this high so it bumps above these highs and then breaks down then we go into an area i mentioned that it's very shorter block and i said we're gonna aim for here and then under here and another under here okay so i gave you a perspective beforehand so that we could study it each day looking for lower prices going in looking for the pattern i taught you in this mentorship around specific elements of time we had this big move from here down here where it attacked the cell stops or sell side liquidity what took place here smart money sold to the buy stops so now they're sitting with a net short position how do they get out of that position they have to buy it back how can they buy it back at a cheaper price guaranteeing them that they're going to be buying from lower priced sellers fine to sell stocks here sell side liquidity rest below here why are there sale stocks below there because traders have models that want to capture these types of moves and expect things like this high to be taken out before they start trailing their stop loss large fund traders not retail rick that trades on mt4 okay that's not what i'm talking about but historically you're going to find out that retail traders are going to have many times their stop losses in the same area that large funds will the only difference in the only contrast between the two is that retail rick or people that are very small speculators the small traders liquidity is so minute it's tiny it's irrelevant but that argument is used by people that don't understand what they're talking about because they'll say what i'm teaching other quote unquote institutional traitors or other youtubers laugh when they say they look at what i'm teaching they say it doesn't work or it's nonsense or it's a fallacy these same people aren't going out and saying how it's a policy when i'm calling you before it happens and now when i say things like that that takes people that want to come in critically and say look he's bragging i'm not bragging i'm asking you all to come in and investigate the things i'm teaching if they don't hold up they won't hold up but if they hold up and the things i'm talking about happen before they happen what does that mean does it mean it's luck no is it leaning on any retail logic no it's not support and resistance it's not supplying demand i'm trading with factors that are outside of that so what is it i'm teaching you liquidity i'm showing you that market efficiency paradigm that i taught early in this series where you are being trained to go into the marketplace and look at how liquidity that is resting in the market or will be engineered to be there where you want it to be what's that mean above old highs those buy stops are being triggered so smart money can go short they're selling short to these buy stops and they're gonna buy it back from resting sell stops that are resting below here sales liquidity so we're not looking at patterns sake trading we're not looking at indicators we're not trying to reinvent the wheel rename old retail logic that's flawed and gimmicked i'm teaching you a whole different perspective on how these markets look they have always looked like this the advantage is that everything is switched to electronic trading that means it's much more efficient and faster so me teaching this is not going to change the fact that this is what goes on okay it will not stop working you will have losing trades if you treat with life funds understand that i have losing trades you're going to have losing trades but you're going to understand why you're wrong you won't beat yourself up about it if you're smart and listen to what i'm telling you to do and avoid the things that toxic thoughts build but you will know more specifically the times and locations where these formations are likely to be successful understand the difference between that it's not promising profitability it's not promising 100 win rate i'm not promising you a high rate of return because all of you are in a driver's seat but look at this chart is this not what i outlined before it happened absolutely it is so this is on a daily chart this is answering the folks that say you know i don't want to do this intraday trading with your target audience my target audience is whoever wants to listen and then they're going to take what i'm teaching and scale it to whatever time frame they want to utilize if they want to be a swing trader this is it this is the model that i showed you right here just being applied to this time frame if you don't see the logic behind it it's because you're still early in your stages of development it's okay don't rush it don't be in a hurry to understand everything and feel like you're you're going to lose your mind if you don't have it understood you know in a couple weeks just enjoy the process i'm giving you the logic and i'm showing you where it's going to go before it happens when it's applicable i'm not promising to do that i'm not an oracle for you okay all right so we're looking at this area here where it drops below this old low it does it here and here on a shallow basis but then we have this real nice decline yesterday on monday's trading so i want to take you into this right here and kind of like build on the idea of what liquidity does once it takes out old lows like this what can it do so we're zoomed in on monday's trading here here's friday's trading and i want to take your attention to something i talked way way way back in 2010 when i was on baby pips and i was contributing to that community and as a reminder one of the things i taught was study the last three days the open the high the low and the close in the last three days now for those of you that were part of that community back then and knew me then it was my laboratory experiment to see if anybody would start seeing the things that i saw early on in my development because nobody really sat down and said hey ict you know look at the open high low and close in the last three days and you're gonna find this thing okay but if you were doing those types of things nobody not one person came to the realization of the fair value gap nobody did okay so no one's going to be able to come out and say oh yeah i was that guy no i was that gap nobody did that okay i shared this fair value got because number one it's powerful two it's not going to stop working and it's unique to everything else out there and it's very specific where it forms and i give you some criteria on how you can find where they form also that are not necessarily where you might expect but i'm also going to incorporate some of the things like rebalancing and then where does this formation form i want to take your attention into this candle here last friday's low so if this was monday go back the last three days you go here here and here now is there a fair value gap in that no but look what monday's trading did it opened extended down and closed near the low it was rather large range today okay great wonderful what do you do with that information go back to the previous day's low if you go back to the previous day's low this is going to be important because if you do this the next trading day which is tuesday today's production video date the 10th of may 2022 if we open up and because we're below those relative equal lows on the daily chart and we're below this swing low also we're now you know in a deep discount we don't try to pick bottoms okay we don't try to call the long-term lows while markets are bearish try to avoid doing i know it seems like it's possible because everybody makes videos on youtube and they write books and they do articles and they say they did this and say they did that they picked the top they picked the bottom i promise you i know a lot and i have lost more money more money trying to do that than any other thing you don't need to do that okay so now think about what this bias has been on these markets what have i stated publicly you all know i've been bearish right so when you see a big down day like this all the indicators are going to flash oversold oversold okay i'm not trying to pick a bottom but indicator followers will look for bullish divergence because they think they're going to catch the ultimate low and they're gonna ride it up when they even if they were lucky to buy the low the chances of holding it long term not likely so it's a fallacy to try to pursue that don't think like that when we have a bias collectively as traders i'm not just saying me specifically for my model if any of you are trading try to avoid trying to pick the tops and the bottoms there's a lot of meat in between the major turning points and you can afford to be wrong at the end because once you're wrong it'll be obvious then you can get insane and go the other way if you have draw down just work on getting it back and then working that middle of the move type idea it serves you well but i want to take this idea here and we're going to drop down into a lower time frame after we see today's price accident trade right up in here now this looks like an indecisive day so if you're looking at a daily chart it can be a little confusing like you know what took place this is a mixed day they'll call it no no no no no let's go into this formation right here okay i'm going to give you some logic now here's the time when we get into the ict videos that a large percent of you do not want to do this part you're welcome to obviously not listen but you're going to miss the opportunity of learning i want you to look at this price action in this fractal now what is a fractal fractal is a piece of price action that's doing something that i'm trying to draw your attention to okay we're studying a very small segment of price action that's a fractal so if we're looking at this and this is that old low that i extended on the daily chart now it's being visualized on an hourly time frame so every one of these candles is not a daily candle which shows the highest high and lowest level daily range it's now an hourly chart where it shows the highest high and lowest low of each individual hour interval i want you to think about what you see here now for those of you that are new don't be discouraged if you don't see what i'm going to show but pause the video and look for what you can identify from what i've taught you so far in this mentorship do not rush through this pause it think about what you see and then unpause the video when you're ready you know who you are you're missing out you should have paused it alright so let's add some detail first in perspective you want to break your daily ranges up by the day and i talk that midnight starts to cross over to a new day i don't care what anybody else tells you this is how the algorithm works it operates on this timeline okay it's on new york time so at midnight here on tuesday we start here the opening price is here if you draw that out in time it goes up it goes down and it comes right back to the close to where it opened up at midnight and it would get very close to what that daily chart showed that indecisive candle where it was a lot of wick to the upside a little bit of wick down to the downside and a small little body okay that looks indecisive on that time frame but if you look closer and you start framing out the things i taught you here is relative equal highs old low what's resting above relative equal highs buy side liquidity what's resting below and all low sell side liquidity the market runs above at 9 30 it hits that old low that red line here that old low it hits that there right at 9 30. then all of the buy side is purged that means all of these spy stops have now been drug into the market by their hair kicking and screaming they're in they're caught long or they've been short and they've been knocked out of their short position either way it doesn't matter to us we just know that that buy side liquidity is likely to be utilized to set up an idea for smart money to be short why because the bias is bearish we have not changed gears we're not trying to pick the bottom so if we're doing this like smart money and we're looking at the market like this and we want to be short up here at this trigger event which we'll look at in a moment where would you want to off set that short position well you have a nice little short term low here so you can take partial below that it hits it beautifully and the previous stays low and it does that run below that low here just as handsomely as it did here so let's go in and use the logic with this idea of rebalancing monday's daily range keying off of this level here notice that the buy side liquidity is ran first this is really important folks if we would have gone down and took the previous low out then ran up here that to me is not bearish this running above buys liquidity here at 9 30 hitting that without having this low taken out that is bearish because it's within the context of the bias that we're looking for when we're operating in the a bearish bias what we're essentially saying is the market's going to go up to a premium for one of two reasons run an old high or highs to take out buy side liquidity so that way smart money can counterparty with them with their short positions they're going to sell to those buy stops then seeking to buy cheaper sell side liquidity that would be their pool of liquidity to offset distribute their shorts below here so they're going to sell here at a high price and buy it back at a cheaper price this is not a random unknown low it's in the marketplace soon as that day close that low is known to everyone but the liquidity resting below that is not necessarily a target or utilization for anybody in any other retail idea that's what i'm trying to shake you by your lapels and say pay attention i'm showing you how to look at the marketplace like smart money not like white golf this is not like off okay it's not sam side and stuff all these things that people like to attribute this is not it this is mine this is i'm telling you how these markets operate and if it's not happening after i say it happens or should happen then i'm a fraud it's fake it doesn't hold up but guess what it works folks look at all the people that are now digging their nose in their charts now with this idea come on now it's catching fire because it's simplified now and i'm showing you what works and it's exciting isn't it it's interesting to see these things panning out all the time every single week every single day and it won't stop the second pool of liquidity is the sell side liquidity so it runs the buy side first with the bearish bias so it's doing what i've taught in this mentorship it goes up to a premium then seeks a discount see that now we're going to drop into a 15 minute time frame zoom on in and get a little bit more details here and now i have added the 8 30 time frame here and we have the relative equal highs the market at 8 30 we're looking for what to happen the news and bar go to lift that means that the algorithm will start seeking liquidity as early as that time frame now it might wait till 9 30 and this candle here is 9 30. notice it hits it right there where we're drawing your attention to because it's rebalancing that entire monday range it's going back to the previous day prior to monday it's old low on friday so when you see that it rebalances the big drop on monday it tricks people into thinking that it's made the low and it's going to keep going up when the only thing it has done is it's gone up to a logical level on that daily time frame that rebalances all of that sell-off on monday it's been rebalanced so if you look at the ninth on the 15-minute time frame this does not look like it's an imbalance but on a daily candle it's a large down day so all of this movement here is big in terms of distribution on the downside this is retracement back up into a logical level which is friday's low and it hits it based on the elements that i taught you and it's following what the logic is that i shared publicly in this series look for relative equal highs at 8 30 it's going to start looking for high or highs to run that's these over here how far can it go that's that friday low there's your framework this is that judas swing that fake rally up okay think about what the daily candle looked like before we started dropping down the lower time frames it was a big wick up and a little bit of a wick down but it was a small little body on the candle for tuesday's trading but if you look at it from the lens of power three how i teach you the accumulation at 8 30 use the opening price that's down here draw that out in time the rally should take place above that it's a logical level i'm teaching you then it creates the pattern that's in the mentorship fair value gap market structure shift then starts to show displacement and distribution to the downside attacking a discount array so this is your power three where it opens rally's up creates the high and trades down there's your move power three but it's inside that daily candle that looks indecisive right so you have to understand what you're looking at relative to time and price when you do that it takes away all that confusion it provides more clarity we're going to drop down into a five-minute chart and start building this into a very visual representation of what you've been learning in this series midnight new york news embargo at 8 30 is lifted now there wasn't a whole lot of news this morning admittedly but this still the same logic relative equal highs at 8 30 starts the algorithm what's it going to do it's going to run for a premium why because the bias is bearish it's going to return likely up into that friday low to rebalance monday's trading its bearish candle is being rebalanced and at 9 30 am the equity market opens that's what this little manipulation is okay what is 9 30 that's when you expect this little type of a move but it begins at 8 30. so that hour-long interval we're expecting when we're bearish a run higher to set up shorts now the short can form inside that hour or it could just provide the leg that sets up the framework that will eventually like i'm going to show you here provide you the setup so all all of it is a matter of studying what the market's providing you it doesn't change the rules i'm not bending the rules i'm giving you the logic behind when these algorithms do what they're doing when price starts to spool from 8 30 up in to friday's low at 9 30 that's that manipulation time where they create that little opportunity where it looks like it's going to do something but it's generally the opposite of what it looks like on the chart and large retail is going to see that as it's breaking out it's going higher and they're going to buy it and chase it and then they have their hinder parts handed to them and then they just run the daily range against them to take out the cell side over here okay but i want you to look inside this five minute run here and notice that this whole area is shaded here that's the judah swing that's the fake rally in a down move that will be profitable for shorts but at the time retail won't see that they won't identify they won't it won't make any sense them they'll be caught off guard but i want you to go into that range here this right here that is your displacement price swing that right there that's the leg on a five-minute chart you strip that down and you start going from five four three two and one until you find your fair guy you got so we're going to do that now but i'm showing you how you're going to put your fib on the high and the low of that for those that don't have the benefit of going back into hindsight you may be watching this video far in the future i've included it here that way it's already done for you for for study purposes the 40 44 and a half level is equilibrium or 50 of the range between the high and the low that run here that drop down why am i neuting this because we have this swing low broken here now it could have stopped there and started to move up and we would use that range from here to here but it just kept breaking lower lower lower so it broke below this low and what looks like this low here so it was several short-term lows that were broken nonetheless this is the displacement price leg so this price swing here you shade that while you're learning and then you start breaking that down into lower time frames so right now we're on the five minute chart i'm going to keep this shaded area here one but we're just going to transition from the five minute chart down to the four minute chart so here's the four minute chart 9 30 is this candle here that's your judas swing at 8 30 it starts its run this is the algorithmic price run goes to friday's low rebalances the entire range on monday's trading it changes the narrative when retail traders think and it's created the low all the bullish diversions they will be seeing other indicators and such they're they're screaming dubai and breakout artists are looking at this break here because they think this is resistance broken now oh it's coming back down to it this is what is this resistance broken turn support right okay breaks down a little bit okay then it starts running okay oh this is one of those instances where it was you know went past a little bit but it's still going to go higher you can almost read into the price action what retail would be expecting here but we're looking for something very specific in this shaded area here we're looking for a fair value gap do you see a fair value gap of you would say this yeah i didn't know that you read my mind ict why not that one what if that what would happen if i went into that and sold short well first of all if you did that you were not following the rules because from this high down to that low this is equilibrium we need to get to a premium we don't want to sell in a discount that's not what we're doing here so we have to get to this level here 40 44 and a half or higher that's a premium based on that price swing do you understand what i just gave you there like that's a hardline rule that if you just follow that it will keep you out of so many ill-fated scenarios now it's not a hundred percent that you're gonna follow that and never take a losing trade because some of you are asking for that secret recipe like i had that if i had it i wouldn't give it to you okay so it doesn't exist and i don't have it so on both sides of defense just stop looking for that expect to lose money if you're gonna trade and you're using live money you're gonna lose money it's a promise i'm guaranteeing you you're always going to run into a scenario that will eventually lose capital money will be withdrawn from your account it sucks it's not fun nobody signs up for that they sign up for well if it works in my favor i could make money i could make enough money to go on vacation each year i could pay my car note those types of things okay and some of you take it to an extreme where you're going to be rich and you ride around and charge airplanes and drive around in cars that cost too much money to each their own all i'm saying is i'm gonna teach you how to read price okay so let's keep it germane to that so there's no four minute there they go on the three-minute chart inside this pink shaded area that's the displacement leg is there a fair value gap you can pause the video here if you want if you need more time all right for those that are prepared there is no fair value gap here either nothing to do yet so you drop down into your two minute chart okay do you see a fair value gap in the two minute chart you can pause the video if you need more time all right if you're not prepared pause the video lo and behold the unicorn here's the favorite you got small little imbalance right in here and we took out the short term low now some of you might see this if you were watching the two minute chart okay say you watched the two minute chart and you saw this short-term low broken here or maybe this one here and you saw this is this displacement one could argue perhaps it is okay now i'm going to give you the alternative this is not twisting the rules it's just showing you the logic of when you put a trade on in your demo account hear that compliance this movement lower creates that fair bay guy yes we have a short term load taken out there okay this entry on this fair bay gap if you utilize that where would your stop loss be it would have to be at least above the candle that creates the fair bag gap that's this one here so your stop will be above here did it hit it no so even if you would have utilized that you're not stopped out with this right here now you might get scared to death when it running up after it moved in your favor like this then comes back and retraces but you cannot listen to me folks you cannot open a trade up like this and put a stop above here and watch it go down here and want to trail your stop loss real tight you can't do that you have to hold with a certain measure of risk open and this is what filters out so many people in this industry they can't do this they either rush to get out of a trade that's marginally profitable because they can't stand it they're making money and they're so used to seeing it turn against them and stop them out or squeeze them if they don't use stops and they get out with big losing trades once they start getting marginally profitable trades they get out prematurely they don't even hold it for the models rules or they trail their stop-loss so tight so quickly it strangles the position it doesn't even give the chance to move and breathe so how do you do that we're going to talk a little bit about stop placement now initially when opens the trade up the rule is you want to use the candle that creates the fair value you got that high just above that okay one tick two ticks above that that's sufficient enough if you are scared and you just want to use a nice handsome ample stop you would use a swing hot here oh that's a lot of movement so what they have micro account positions that you can trade with so you may not be trading them any trade micros if it requires you that much of a stop to sleep at night okay knowing that what you're doing isn't going to wreck and ruin you then use micros it's five dollars per point or handle versus fifty dollars per handle on a mini so it's scalable it's something that most people should be able to weather if you can't weather something like that with a micro then you're really trading is you're not prepared to trade you don't have enough equity and you're underfunded okay and i don't mean that to be talking down to anybody that's just the real skinny okay a lot of people try to go in here and they want to trade with 100 account and you're just asking to fail you really are asking to fail so you can't be under-capitalized but once you place your stop here or here when do you start moving your stop well you want to see a larger shift in structure when this low is taken out down here then then you can move your stop down say it was up here then you can move it to here okay or maybe here why because it's already broke down so it's not going to go down here and come back up here if it does then you're probably wrong or it's going to consolidate which means it's going to be an ugly condition to be working within anyway see the logic there i'm accepting the fact that i'm probably gonna be wrong if it stops me out but who cares if it does why would i have that opinion of not caring if it stops me out how many times have you seen this pattern form think about it over the course of a week how many times does a pattern form it's forming somewhere every day it's flowing everywhere either in the london session overnight highs and lows or it's forming in a new york session i'm teaching the new york session because you have the advantage of knowing what took place in london that's that's why i'm teaching this does it work in london absolutely does it work in asia not that often and that's why i haven't pushed hard for asia i know some of you hey i need to know something in asia for those ideas and those traders that are really focused on trading that time frame and because they have businesses or that's just the way they can trade only it's the time that they can be in front of the charts you want to be trading the yen pairs for forex you want to be trading the new zealand dollar and australian dollar they tend to have a little bit more movement during those periods because that's when their markets start so you can look for this type of pattern to form there on the one through five-minute charts in the asian session so i gave you that that's as far as i'm going to go with it i'm not going to be doing all kinds of videos about it just know it's one of the most ill liquid times for me i'm letting the market create those periods of the day where a lot of traders are starting early because like anything else we're really quick to get into something but we rarely ever finish it and students that come under my wing are really good testimonials about that they'll come in they'll say i'm going to stick with this but then they realize it takes a little bit more effort than they're ready for and they quit and trading in general is like that and they think that because in new zealand wellington doesn't really begin today they think and they teach and all these other traders have to say you know wellington starts the 24-hour cycle and it does not start the cycle this is how you know someone doesn't know what they're talking about these algorithms operate on new york time and it begins at midnight period and the story i don't care who's brother's cousin's sister knows this guy that works at a bank that says ict's fool crap i don't care bring those people here challenge what i'm showing you here okay show me how this is wrong that's all i'm asking because i'm doing it i'm proving it and everybody else is seeing it themselves so do you dismiss the evidence do you ignore it you walk around with blinders on because maybe i'm not the person that fits what you were hoping for in terms of a mentor i'm being honest and i'm proving it i'm showing it to you it's repeating why argue why wrestle with it take it be thankful you know and and do something positive with it so here's what we have we have the whole model identifying a setup moving back to a rebalance of monday's price range back up to friday's low hitting that level there and then creating the setup that's happening at the time elements the same way i teach it in the series and here it is boom comes in hits it breaks down pairs up with a sell side liquidity smart money sells short here and then adds to it here breaks trades in here during the lunch hour your limit order if it was used would be filled during the lunch hour not around 12 30. the only thing about this day that i did not like is i would have rather seen it deliver this movement here just ahead if not right at 12 o'clock that's the only thing that did not line up with what i was expecting today i was looking for this candle right here to punch down and hit that level go through it like it did here and it was just about 27 minutes later so that's not bad right i mean looking at it like this doesn't this make sense seriously folks in closing doesn't this logic make sense the market goes up to trick people and they think it's going to go higher or not those people that are short making money going down in other words their orders that protects them or puts them in a new trade going up or out of a short trade that buy side liquidity is attacked the algorithm goes up there not because people bought it not because smart traders work together to get the trade to go up there because of their buying pressure that's not what this is folks the algorithm goes up there whether there is sufficient volume or not that's the dividing statement when i say those types of things people that think they understand these markets people that have made money doing things that have nothing to do with how these markets book it's hard for them to understand what i'm saying because their faith based religion on their system prevents them from seeing the obvious logic that's being shown here these markets are controlled they're rigged and they're algorithmically driven how many times do you need to see these things before you can just lay down all the other ideas there's no reason to buy other people's courses and i'm not going to get flamed for this and then i'm gonna invite more trolls i don't care okay you don't need to buy any courses you don't need to be in anybody else's subscriptions okay teaching rehash stuff what i'm showing you here if you put the time in learning this you will not need to do anything else period you won't need to worry about breakers so you won't need to worry about mitigation blocks you won't need to worry about buy side bill and sell side inefficiencies none of those things that's also taught in the things i teach in my private group why why would you want anything more than this this is so easy this is so easy it doesn't inundate you with so many things and variables that's what's going on right now i'm gonna be honest with you folks my private group which no one can join anymore is so rich with things that make it almost impossible for most of the students to pick what they are going to settle in because everything i show works but they can't settle in on one thing because they're like a kid in a candy store and because of that they're not really fully engaging with one specific approach with this listen to the comments we'll read the comments actually some of them are actually in the comments saying this worked for me and they've been charter members for years what was it i did what i've trained them to do but they weren't willing to do on their own which is take what makes sense one pattern one setup applied time and price theories that i teach around the algorithmic ideas and then look for that one setup and submit to it just that and make it very very simple that's what this is folks i can do this with a breaker i can do this with a mitigation block i can do this with a just a stop run on buy stops i can do it with a run on cell stops i can simplify all this anything i trade with i can do this the same way i can strip it down to a simple model there's no need to ask me to join my private group folks so please stop asking in the comment section please stop sending me emails i don't want your money i don't need your money okay i don't need any of those types of things i i want to do what i'm doing here i enjoy this i have a t-shirt at heart i love doing this and the fact that i'm seeing so many people around the world dive into this and find their own niche in it and it only takes the time to invest in reading the things i'm showing in the chart listening to the logic i'm teaching in the audio commentary and then doing the homework assignments of back testing and looking at it you will decide at that moment if this is something that fits you if it doesn't fit you there's no harm in that i'm not offended by that i have people that paid me that said i just can't make this work for me and i have other people that are killing it what's the difference personality and capacity some people can't do it at all some people can do it they just haven't done the proper things in the right order this is a simplification what i have done here in this series whether you realize it or not my mentorship group that have paid me some of them were kicking and screaming because i've done this others majority have been very appreciative because they have used this to help understand what it is that they should be doing with all the other things i taught now when i say that it sounds like i'm dangling a carrot oh he's got more secret stuff and this is better there is nothing more easier readily made just go out and start doing what i than this okay i swear to you okay listen folks this is an invitation if you are a private member of my mentorship okay tell everyone in the comment section that this is something that has been spelled out very simply and plainly better than any other model that i've done i've done 12 specific trading models in my private mentorship this one here i stripped down i made it very very simple with the expectation my daughter would learn it this is the easiest ict application you're ever going to get i literally sat down and said how can i take something that my daughter who has no interest whatsoever none how can i make this so that way she could see it when to expect it when will it form how to figure out where it should be and what do you do once it forms that's what i've done here is it hard for some of you it would it would feel like it is because i'm reading some of the comments and it's because you haven't spent enough time that's all but i promise you when there's more examples shown and you go through the videos a few times it'll start to become more clear if you're trying to apply other things like bollinger bands and garbage like that you're you're not using the model and you're not going to get the results that would be otherwise available to you if you just do what i'm telling you to do and avoid the things i'm telling you to avoid that's it i promise you this if you give this um three months of study serious sleaze rolled up diligently going in every single day back testing and looking at it and then for at least two or three more months of forward testing it six months six months with just what i've taught here i am confident i am absolutely confident that you will have found your model it's simple it's role based it's visually pleasing to see because you know what you're looking for it's a specific time pattern with the algorithm so you're getting in sync with what the algorithm is going to do just like smart money does okay you want to be like the composite man this is what the composite man's doing he's not looking at white golf schematics and i know that might upset some of you that's not my intent but they're looking at liquidity like this they're looking at how the market's going to allow them to fleece the uninitiated that's just the way it works folks you might not like it it might feel unfair so therefore i don't want to believe this guy he's talking conspiracies call it whatever you want to call it i call it the market until next time be safe

all right so we're gonna be doing a quick little ditty on institutional order flow i'm gonna be trading against daily bias okay and going along here and it's on the basis of the cell stops or cell side like already being taken we've already traded into a fair value gap around that 4 000 level and i'm treating with the idea that it could run up here and take out the buy stops above the high of the day it doesn't need to do that to be profitable so my draw liquidity is here and noting the buy side liquidity will take in clear profitable shorts all right so this is kind of like the the idea okay the draw on liquidity now it doesn't need the trade here to be profitable that's just my best case scenario so what i want to do now is draw the buy side and sell side liquidity pools and i'll show you the framework for the logic of why i'm entering where i'm entering it and i want you to take a look at the chart first and see if you understand what i'm capitalizing on pause the video all right this here is the sell side liquidity so the market has dropped below those relative equal lows i bought those cell stops so cell side is taken okay so you can see that here and now what i'm going to target even though i think it could go but it may not really get there it can go to 40 51 and take out the high of the day but let's say i'm wrong what am i going to aim for this is what i'm going to take the bulk of my position off at and i got to make this show on top of the line okay and put it on top all right so i'm reaching for that now the bulk of my position i'm going to try to pyramid and build this this is a little bit bigger than just the four contracts but we'll see what i get now try not to worry about that profit and loss that's that's the distraction pay attention to the price so we dipped inside that fair value gap just to the left of us and we went below to take out the relative equal lows that's noted here for the south side liquidity being taken so i'm looking for expansion to the upside retail sees that as a bear flag okay so they're thinking lower prices i'm not even if i'm wrong about it not going to 4051 i'm confident that we're going to go up into the buy side liquidity that's needed in blue okay so far price looks nice it's respecting the unbind narrative i'm acting upon now i want you to also monitor how i manage my stop loss even though i'm trading against the daily bias the fact that we traded down three times intraday and took out yesterday's low by doing so uh that lack of follow-through kind of like bolsters i'm gonna do two more here trading on to the order block okay so now i have six contracts long and i'll move my stop up just a little bit underneath that low right there it should not trade back down into that if it does i'm wrong and that's fine why do i feel confident about placing my stop loss there because if you look where i have my stop it's basically inside of the lower end of that fair value gap and the old short term high around 9 30. so i have market structure supporting the idea and we've already taken cell side liquidity out we're back inside the range between where my stop loss order is and the short term high i have noted for buy side liquidity so bicep liquidity is the next draw on liquidity i'll take four of the contracts off so i'm going to annotate what we're doing here we're just bumping the order block there straighten this line out here okay hold down shift when you're dragging your trend lines and treating view it'll automatically straighten them out and that is an order block bullish order block is what i'm annotating here so you can see this is all being done as it happens i can shoot bubble gun and walk at the same time all right and that's what i'm looking for i'm looking for that type of movement so that way we understand what i'm internalizing what am i seeing what's likely to pan out that's what i want so now i'm going to study see if price does in fact deliver with that premise in mind again if i'm lucky it could expand up into that 40 51 in the quarter but i don't need it to because the bulk of the position which is now six contracts i'm going to take four off above that buy side liquidity should i get the opportunity to do so and i'll do it on the basis of a market order all right so far we're getting some response off that order block level i've annotated ocd is flaring i like things the way i like them folks all right nice little caffeine bar there caffeine bar is something i named big green candles if i'm bullish i want to see that i'm embarrassing i see it i don't like it so i'm just being a little facetious here you don't see that type of stuff called before it happens that precise but it's okay i'm gonna give you some more evidence here today now this is what you want to do also if you're practicing reading order flow tape reading you don't have to necessarily put a demo account position on i'm doing it just simply because a lot of people like to see it okay this is me just making sure you understand that i see this before it happens not speaking in waffles where it's hard to tell what i'm saying what i'm expecting it's very very specific nothing ambiguous is being hinted at in here okay so cell side has been taken this is now being dimmed so that way the focus is on the the levels that are more pronounced in color now see there's two down closed candles the higher candle of the two i'm going to draw an older block on it can drop down into that pick up momentum from there and then the algorithm will likely reprice higher to the bicep liquidity or around that 40 36 level so i'm allowing for and preparing myself should it trade down into that level it might just touch the higher wick of the two down closed candles i'm anchoring to i'm using the uppermost opening price as kind of like the level i'm looking for but that small little wick high it might just touch that and be enough or may not even touch it at all but when you're watching order let me make this a little bit more thicker so you can see it be able to track what price is doing now this is one of those instances where you're looking for price to kind of like drive higher you want to do it in like big candles speed delivery right to where you're looking for traders are now trying to go short because they looked at that imbalance the 8 30 the quick sudden drop the market has come back and rebalanced that now it's starting to drift lower people that follow imbalances and things like that because they've gotten real popular lately that idea they're trying to sell short on i'm going against that and i'm targeting them okay so that's a that's a buy right there some order block right there all right i would adjust that line but i've already outlined what i'm saying here it's basically touched the little wick so if i wanted to add one more which i guess i could i could buy one here just to prove the point but it is what it is let's assume that this is all we're going to build on i want to see it rally higher from here notice i'm not in a hurry to rush my stop-loss up very nice price delivery there so think about what's being shown here the down close candles are supporting price we're seeing expansion and where is the bull's-eye get ready turn 50 my eyes are not what they used to be folks i'm sure if it was a rattlesnake i'd be bit by now uh there it is i should have checked my most recent ones at the top all right so we'll put that right here that's our bullseye okay and i can bring my stop-loss up to break even i'm actually going to get that a little bit higher now you can see the profit and loss for these guys that like to see those numbers flashing all right so i'm going to take four off when it runs above that high and then i'll consider moving my stop up and see if i can get lucky the rest of the day i have things i have to take care of administrative things and video production so should we get this run up above i'm going to close four at market okay just sitting here waiting for it to deliver and again those odor blocks were drawn real time you saw it happen i've outlined it gave you the logic and we'll see if we can get some magic there we go so i'm going to show you the executions here and we can see the the business okay and i'll leave it up to the market to decide whether or not it wants to go up here and take the 40 51 and a quarter level it doesn't need to at this point i've booked over five hypothetical thousand dollars in this example here reading order flop and that will be it for this one i believe and i'll just change this color here because now it's been fulfilled and my typical sarcastic ribbing gotta be me so here is the final here is the buying four four thousand six and a quart and a half and then buying this here so the initial was buying the fair value gap sales ops then the order block then selling four above here and i moved the stop loss up and it tripped me out right there on the final two so hopefully you found this insightful until next time be safe

all right folks welcome back this is our 27th episode of the continuing series of the free 2022 ict mentorship on youtube all right so massdeck daily chart for june 2022 and here we have friday's trading here okay friday thursday wednesday tuesday monday so we had a nice little decline down in this week and then friday we have somewhat of a retracement if you've been following my community posts on the youtube channel i mentioned this morning that the 12 553 level is too clean and you can kind of see it in here like look at the high on this candle it's twelve thousand five forty seven and then here this high is twelve thousand five hundred and fifty three so i'm using this as the higher one but these relative equal highs that's what i'm looking at so i'm i'm thinking that it could draw there now i was giving it the opportunity to do so today based on what i showed in these short little vignettes i've posted on my video section i was out about today so obviously i was sharing what i could on my phone i don't generally trade on the phone i can manage a position but i'm not generally trying to enter trades and such but i made a mistake today and i was trying to exit as i'll talk about in a moment when we get into lower timeframes but i was showing segments of me recording where the market was what it was doing when i was entering the whole business and you'll actually see the execution errors and all that business here tonight but uh the relative equal highs that was the draw on liquidity now the draw on liquidity does not need to be traded to to have a profitable framework or setup okay so what do i mean by that well if we're below this objective and i'm thinking and if which you thinking the same thing if you think that market's going to draw up to that level whether it be today or into next week you look for a setup that will allow you some kind of participation in this expansion towards that it doesn't need to get there as you'll soon see we're going to drop down into the hourly chart all right so here's the hourly chart you can see relative equal highs up in here look at the high on that candle there that's the 12 553 and a quarter level okay so that's what i'm framing it on and we traded down started to run higher we had a shift in market structure here and then just notice how we have had this low this low swept we came down below it came back above these relative equal lows and then we came back down tried one more time to go lower and then rejected it notice that so as the market's starting to trade higher where is it likely to go well we've already taken out a large pool of liquidity below these relatively equal lows this is sell side okay now we're back above these relative equal lows so where's buy side clear and obviously right here okay not really obvious in terms of any imbalance in here because we already rebalanced this area there so there's nothing really all that exciting except for that small little section there so if it's going to go up to this area here my thought process is that it's likely to probably just punch through and take the buy stops resting above here so that's the the draw on liquidity just think of it like a big magnet drawing price up towards it okay so we're going to drop down into a 15 minute time frame [Music] all right so here's the 15 minute time frame and here's friday the 13th you scared are you scared so we have the market trade here lower low low so this right here may trip you up but this right here was a 9 30 in the morning manipulation where it takes up this overnight london low creates the manipulation idea then rallies i was not available during this time so i didn't take any trades as you'll see there's no trades in this area and then the retracement here in the afternoon that's what i was looking for so i wanted to see that type of idea so i'm going to add the annotations to the chart now all right so here's the five minute chart and here's the overnight london lows 9 30 we run through it taking out the sell side here and then it starts to rally all this rallying up here i was not able to participate in the market trades lower down into the range between this low and this high what is it trading to discount so i'm going to go into this area a little bit tighter okay so we can see here's our consolidation it drops down creates the low of the day power three so it's accumulating long positions manipulating early longs out of the market taking out the stops overnight then rallying and then i'm looking for the continuation up to take out the relative equal highs here because i think i'm still going to see continuation in the afternoon so i want to buy this discount market and i'm going to be buying inside of this value gap because it's at or below equilibrium between this low and the high all right so i've added the annotations here and i gotta adjust this because my obsessive compulsive disorder is flaring it's like a spider sense folks can't help it all right so we have the new york session open at 9 30 in the morning new york local time creates the low of the day rallies creates the high here at what time what time is this candle here it's 12 10 that's that lunch time and i told you it creates usually a retracement of some sort or consolidation then it retraces lower and then here is 130 right about there so at 130 the algorithm will start seeking liquidity if it's going to continue higher what's it likely to do seek sell sign so we're sell side well we have relative equal loads here but is that a discount from here to here no so this dashed line here that's in purple i have that noted as equilibrium that's essentially the same thing as it's taking the fib from here to here and that's 50 okay so now we have equilibrium there the market drops down into equilibrium and then below it into the variable gap here this candle is high this candle is low that's your imbalance failure gap is here so the market drops down into it here at two o'clock in the afternoon 205 215 220 225 and then displacement okay we'll see this fair value gap on the lower time frames i'm going to go through and let you see it but this displacement on the outside is a shift in market structure in a day that's likely to be bullish it's counter trend to a higher time frame we're working with the logic that it's probably going to be a retracement because we've been down for a long time now and most people are probably going to want to get out over the weekend so the algorithm is going to start squeezing on them to get their positions squared before the close of the friday so in this area here we're going to drop down into a four-minute chart okay no fair value got shown here except for this small little area there now by itself you know that's possible you get a small little return into it there i'm not looking at that okay go down into a three-minute chart okay there's a gap there again you can see that candle right there that would be fine if that's what you were looking for and then two minute chart there is gotta set my chart back it's got to be the way i want it folks all right so we have down closed candles in here order block fair value gap this candle is low this candle is high there's our imbalance the order block it trades down drops into that and i'm going to show you the executions here so as it's dropping down in here you can see i have hover top of this thing i bought 36 contracts and the assumption is we're using a discount broker something like amp futures i'm not repping amp futures by the way but they have really low margins so that would be allowed for something with the equity that was used in this example today these are paper trades so you guys know for compliance reasons and full disclosure i'm illustrating execution and theory okay i'm also showing you what i was doing when i was on twitter when i did use mt4 which i don't do anymore i haven't used mt4 in years okay i don't need to have a fake mt4 server to be able to do this okay this is what i was doing and i was trading it and building it up and building it up and building it up so in a matter of a week or so i've taken a hundred thousand dollar account took it over 300 000 okay and you'll see that here in a second but as it was dropping down dropping down all this candle here i was buying at the beginning of the um fair value gap and about the middle of it and i was trying to get into the lower portions of it but it didn't quite get down there so the fairway gap in the shaded area that's what's being shown here take that off for clarity's sake and we drop in here i mentioned in the small little vignette again i've done three videos today that were basically silent i put a little bit of a music thing on it just to i don't know i was testing it out i was really disappointed didn't play the entire time the video was playing but whatever the idea was i was showing you that when we went into the order block that it was going to rally up okay and it rallied up and then i took off 10. i saw a small little vignette shows me closing 10 contracts there and i was looking for it to maybe stage a run up into that twelve five five three level that i mentioned on my community post okay but obviously we were running out of time today and i messed up on the close of the 20 contracts because i wanted to take off 20 above here and try to put it in as a limit order but it ended up closing his market so what i should have done was and i said this to my private group too i'm working with tradingview but i'm used to using actual live platforms so the things that i can do in other places i can't necessarily do here and because i'm doing it on my phone and i was out doing other things it real real life and this is the reason why you don't want to be trading off of your phone okay but anyway i ended up closing uh the 20 here so i didn't get it above that 12 430 level i was trying to aim for so i missed it there and then i closed more here and here and then finally in late in the day i had one left and i just took it off here okay so that's the business there and i want you to look at how the market created this counter trend idea but still using my fair value gap principle and concept liquidity was above here the day was bullish the algorithm kept pricing higher and higher and higher and the logic was delivered here so look at where the arrows are for entries and this was a failure on my part i didn't get the price i actually wanted none of these closures were actually above the 12 430 level that was i think the closest one yeah that was the closest one there so and i had one left over here and that was the final bit of business i was leaving it just in case some freaky occurrence where it would take us up in some parabolic run into twelve five five three but this wasn't in the cards today we're gonna steam you can frame what i'm teaching inside of a counter trend model if that's what you are by nature a contrarian if you want to be trading with the highest probability and in sync with the early session move then trade exactly how i've outlined the principles around that 8 30 to 9 30 window okay i'm trying to do my best to give you a little bit of freedom to try to make it your own and inspire you also that these fair value gaps are useful if you know what the bias is okay and i know some of you are still posting in the comment section i'm still struggling with vice it's only because you haven't worked at it long enough okay it you're not going to watch a dozen of my videos and come away now i know exactly how to do bias you have to go into the charts and study each day back testing what is back testing going back and looking at moves like this okay marking them up on your chart now you can do it either using the replay button watching them paint partially or you can go back in hindsight and mark up your chart like this this is all back testing all this is is me showing you what i actually did now i was going to be facetious and talk about this for those that didn't really see the videos that i posted today where actually did the pushing of the button here the idea of me seeing it before it happens that's proof of concept and it's proof of understanding okay so i'm the author of this algorithm so i can operate in it very efficiently you as a student of mine you have to understand my language first and then you go into the charts and you study with that language and you'll be able to see repeating phenomena and because you're able to do this in your own leisure you collect these examples of hindsight movement with all of your annotations and your points of interest that you studied and see in your observations anywhere in a chart where it's empty space you want to utilize that and have any kind of observation or encouragement to yourself and you want to tell yourself in those commentaries that you saw this coming okay and what this does is it tricks your brain it's self-talk okay it's one of the things i actually use to overcome agoraphobia which was the fear of being around other people because i had extreme anxiety that started obviously from trading because i built up this large image of myself and in 2001 all that stuff happened okay and i was afraid of a lot of things and i had serious anxiety attacks panic attacks that would come on out of nowhere the coping skills that i learned to deal with generalized anxiety i found that were very useful in teaching my students and it was simply by taking positive self-talk placing that into your back testing where you're note taking your by all face value of it you're lying to yourself in these posts in your back testing so in your study journal only you were seeing it but you're tricking your brain and your subconscious because you're writing it out in your own words you're studying it you're looking at it your subconscious is retaining the image but it's also retaining what you're saying in it so when you come back to it at the end of the week or the previous weeks back testing log journals you read them and when you read them to yourself you're reading your own words saying i saw this setting up where this was likely to drop down here and i was expecting this turn here because the fair value got i wanted to see this displacement and it occurred just like i was expecting and it comes back down and allows me an opportunity to go long then i expected the market to move aggressively away from this area and start working towards the short-term highs and i wanted to take something off above halfway high to low i want to take a premium profit scaling and that's what that is there so you're pouring yourself into the chart with your annotations for back testing and you're doing it in such a way where you're tricking your subconscious like you expected this to happen and over time when you do that you're recording this subconsciously you don't realize you're doing it but by doing these things over and over and over again it activates your reticular activating system it's the same thing happens when you buy a car you go out the next day all of a sudden it seems like everybody else bought the same car the only difference is is you've been more sensitive to that because it's more meaningful to you so these charts will take on that same characteristic when you make them more meaningful to you how do you do that you place your personality and your interest in the chart so everything here i'm giving you a narrative here you would do the same thing just typing it out putting it in there and then screen capturing it and storing it in your journal or printing it out and putting in your journal those things over time will start building on your subconscious as pseudo-memories so critics that hear me say this you're like oh you're you know this fraud's telling you to lie to yourself i'm being honest you are lying in the chart when you do your annotations for study purposes you're tricking your brain like you had experience seeing this happen but because over time you're doing that your subconscious will retain that and when you start seeing it live it will remember hey i remember that because i did that before when you technically really didn't but then now you have pseudo experience it sounds strange like it couldn't possibly work like this but it does our brains are extremely intricate they're very powerful but they can be short-circuited a little bit and used in an advantageous way of studying and this is one way i teach my students in mentorship and this is what i'm trying to suggest that you do for your back testing all you have to do is look at old moves study them annotate your charts it's as rich as you want that chart to be that's what you're doing you're trying to make it as meaningful to you as you possibly can and over time you'll create a measure of pseudo experience that will build upon over time how much time it i don't know it although you're gonna develop at your own pace and you're going to arrive at full understanding right on time so it might be a couple weeks for some of you may take a year for others it may take a little bit longer than that it depends on what you pour yourself into by doing it and i'll leave that part up for you to decide how much effort you're going to put into it but i wanted to share something today and kind of like answer those individuals that like to say that mt4 rented servers were used and stuff and i don't need that folks i mean it's not necessary so um let's go over here and you can see there's a hundred thousand and there's some red in there folks yeah two back-to-back losing trades okay and that was the business okay that was uh since the sixth of this month 100 000 account to 354 000 paper trading obviously but that's what i was doing on twitter all those years i was showing and showing and showing and this proves concept it proves that these things work i'm looking at live data when i'm doing this this is actually no delay you can see there's no d up here there's no little dot showing you it's as real as real can be okay if i can't see these things happening before it happens it will fail but if i can see them live forming and i haven't understand what the algorithm is going to do then i should be able to operate like this and i saw a comment today on one of the video vignettes i did and can we get past the drama and proving who made money i'm not sure what the poster intended with that because i thought that was what you wanted to see when you came here like why would you come to my channel or anyone else's channel that has anything to do with technical analysis or trading if they can't prove they can do what they say they can do all i'm doing is sharing my experience and the prowess i have if i can't do this i'll follow my face i can do it and i want to be an encouragement to those that are genuinely concerned because they see stupid stuff posted on the internet folks listen i don't know how much of this you need to see before you finally get over it but i don't mind doing it okay i don't mind doing it i enjoy doing this i enjoy sharing it and i know it's an encouragement to people that had a little bit of doubt say hey look you know did you really use an mt4 rented server on twitter because we don't really see it we just hear other people talking about it well here's again more proof that listen this is just a matter of like a week or so okay um in five and a half weeks or six weeks i could easily do what i'm doing here and it compounds over and over and over again okay just because i'm doing it with a demo account doesn't mean that you're gonna be able to go out there and do it too with a live account the only thing i'm showing you here is i understand what i'm doing so i think that's going to be it for tonight and i will touch base with you lord willing next tuesday for another lecture and probably a little bit longer video then okay until then enjoy your weekend be safe

all right folks welcome back this is episode 29 I'm gonna be doing a brief review of what took place today I obviously executed today I wasn't planning on doing two videos but uh obviously by the comments some people are a little bit confused so I kind of want to bring your attention back too that 12 553 and a quarter level which is the relative equal highs here on NASDAQ so that was kind of like the basis for why I went into the market today Monday the 16th of May 2022. the bullish bias I was looking for this drawing liquidity still for Nasdaq I originally went in looking for a trade in NASDAQ but all right and the s p much like the NASDAQ had a daily swing low and while we didn't have relative equal highs here for s p the bias was in my opinion warranted for at least the beginning of the week looking for a continuation on the outside before I get into it tomorrow which is Tuesday May 17 2022 8 30 in the morning New York local time we have retail sales numbers and then two o'clock in the afternoon New York local time we have the FED chairman speaking so there's going to be all kinds of volatility at two o'clock tomorrow that's the reason why the market was kind of like lethargic today but I wanted to kind of like showcase something so today I kind of like wanted to put a nail in the coffin finally about this whole business about rented in T4 servers okay I'm never going to bring the conversation up again or the topic again I think everyone knows now by seeing what I've done here just in a short span of time if I did this for another five six weeks you could clearly see that it's not impossible for the same things I was doing on Twitter years and years ago okay with mt4 I'm not using mt4 here I can't game this system I'm using live data you're watching the execute it is what it is folks okay now it's paper trading it's demo trading but I do it just to prove that I can read this stuff I'm not trying to beat my chest I'm not trying to brag but I just want to finally put this to bed because it's still you see people talking about all the time when they do that kind of talking you take them back to these videos here you link these videos to them and let them choke on it all right so we have the one minute chart I went right into the one minute chart because we're starting with the bullish bias and at 9 30 we see the market does in fact take out a short-term High it declines I'm not interested in going short it does not give me a pattern anyway notice that there's no fair value Gap Revisited the market creates this relative equal low starts a rally trades up into the afternoon in here I want to see it create a buying opportunity now the logic behind all this is we're in a day before Fed chair speaks so there's going to be very low volatility as a result of that so it's going to be a small range day doesn't mean you can't trade it obviously but it takes a little bit more experience now I'm not saying that you should trade ahead of Fed chair Powell speaking or any future fed chairman because it's going to be a very quiet day usually like this okay and it's important to know when the volatility is likely to occur and when also the volatility is likely to shrink up and get kind of like lethargic if you look at the s p at the top see the drop down relative equal lows and then we have the same similar pattern here but look what NASDAQ was doing see that lower low when s p was saying I don't want to go that low so it was resisting going lower then we retraced higher just like this NASDAQ did but that NASDAQ made a lower low than that of 10 o'clock in the morning while at the same time the s p said no once again I'm not going lower than the low I made at 10 o'clock so we had a Divergence here and here no indicators folks I'm using inter-market relationships and this is what I dub smt smart money technique or smart money tool now the importance of that is I already had a bias that's bullish there was no short trades that were lined up with this model today there was no interest in wanting to be short I want to focus on being long so we're in the one minute chart here and I want you to take a look at what we have framework wise obviously you've probably already seen the short video compressed today but looking at Price action like this yes you can see there is a rally up it breaks the short term low a fair value Gap it trades up into it and breaks down big deal this doesn't fit the criteria because the displacement leg here would require us to see a fair value Gap above 50 of the high and the low the displacement leg and we don't have that so nothing here fits the model for a short but Watch What Happens the market creates a run-on sell stops here then Morales retraces back down into a fair value Gap I've seen this happening but I was trying to get the recording software that I use and by the way let me just throw this in here too because I see people asking my website address as a watermark trading view doesn't do that okay I use my Camtasia recording software that helps me do these videos it's just an application you can overlay like a like a text call out I call it and that's what it is so it's really when I'm doing the recording talking there is nothing here it's a it's a blank chart and then at the end of the recording when I'm editing it I'll just add in my website address and so anyway with that said we've seen the market trade back down in and I was trying to get the Camtasia Studio to open up and sometimes it doesn't open up and give me what I need so I have to close it down entirely and restart it and the whole time this candle was doing its business and I wanted to see it returned into the sphere of a gap once more and I got in on this candle here and we'll look at the relationship between the NASDAQ which was a little bit sloppier in here versus the s p a little bit more structured here so the fair value Gap in here this candle in here it Wicks down into it and I want to get close to this fair value Gap without it running too far away so I kind of like want to touch a little bit tonight with close proximity entries that means you might not get so precise with your entries you might fumble with your order entry or something might happen like it happened with me I I wanted to record me entering not just simply say here here's a trade I took so I wanted to show obviously me getting in putting a stop managing the position and adding the second position in here what do you do in this situation if you miss the ideal entry well as long as you're getting in there really close or like I'm suggesting here a close proximity entry I don't think there's anything wrong with it so if we are looking for entry patterns the idea is we want to get into where our model is suggesting it so we're seeing the market trade lower lower it's failing to make a lower low like NASDAQ and we have this load is probably not going to be taken out because we're bullish the market rallies up we have a short-term shift in Market structure that trades back down into the Fairway Gap look how many opportunities if you go along one two three four five six seven eight eight candles it gave an opportunity to get in this area here either inside the Fairway Gap or in close proximity to it now when the market starts to Rally I have one more indication that the market structure has shifted again bullish with these highs taken out here and then they had a small little Fair bag out there and then you watch me add more the limit order came in filled it I only had one and a half or no I'm sorry one and three quarters handles okay seven ticks if you want to think of it like that at seven ticks of Heat against me on this little candle here before I started running in my favor I took the full pool off here and I did not get the highest high I was a little disappointed in that regard but uh the the candle obviously hit it there and we'll go over to trading View and look at the business all right we're over here on trading view this is live you can see time of this recording this is where I'm sitting down at the computer and the market trades lower creates that short-term run here rallies breaking Market structure to this upside trades into the fair value Gap and the secondary fair value Gap and it runs up into the liquidity above here now if I add the executions I want you to see look right in here and right in here and up here where you'll see the excess and entries respectively so you can see there's that candle that entry 3994 and a half 3996 and a quarter and it went down to 94. what's the low here yeah 94 and a half so it was only less than two handles Heat against me before I started relying there this one 399 450 was right in here and the low on this candle 93 in a quarter so one and a quarter no less than one yeah one less than one handle of heat entering on this candle here and the next candle had a little bit of retracement so very very very tight placement and this was not entering in the fair value Gap it was in close proximity to it so the underlying idea was it was going down in here to go higher retrace into that to go higher and you saw me map out all this stuff here and call it up in you know business is done but the exit up here 4022 and a half and that's that you can see there is no short positions in here no short positions over here on that business and on NASDAQ we'll pull that up to sort of completeness sake too [Music] okay and no executions here see so all the business was done in the s p today so my question to you is when you see these videos and I'm trying to illustrate obviously that I don't need to fraud anyone the things I'm teaching you I think that you're seeing evidence that it works hopefully you guys have seen enough with this here um do the math folks okay in less than a week and a half how much more would you see this compound if I did it for six more weeks or five weeks is it hard to imagine the things that I did on Twitter with mt4 not a rental nt4 server literally pushing a button putting the orders in doing the whole business okay I know a lot of you have just discovered me and you're seeing people post stuff about how other Traders or other mentors or other teachers they fake their positions I'm open about paper trading because it's compliance I'm not legally allowed to give you trade advice so I'm protected by my discussion in paper trading because you cannot make money with paper trades and you can't lose money with paper trades but I've always said this from the beginning I've dubbed myself the demo baller I championed that Meme because I want to make sure everyone knows that I'm not promising you profitability I don't dangle a care in front of you and saying you're going to do what I'm doing here because you're not going to be able to replicate this you're not okay don't be deceived by seeing me do this again for like the fifth time running up an account like this would Breakneck speed velocity and this is just casually dealing in a tight range when there's large ranges I could have easily taken this over to a million dollars already but it doesn't prove anything except for the fact that I can read price action that's all that's all I'm showcasing I'm not trying to say I'm the best I'm not trying to say that you can't make money in other things I'm just saying I know how to read these candlesticks I know what they're likely to do most of the time before they do it not all the time I take losing trades but when it's really likely to work with the algorithm I'll be dialed in you can't fake what I'm doing you can see me executing the trade you can see me managing the trade you can see the orders entering and filling they pop up they verify the whole thing no replay button up here none of this stuff okay see how that's blue now like you can't create that same scenario so I'm hopefully satisfying this discussion that people like to bring up all the time about rented mt4 servers because like that they couldn't wait to put that on me because they watched me do just like this and I ran up to five million dollars in a little less than one and a half months Okay so I understand that doesn't seem possible I understand that people that would be able to do what I'm doing could very easily go out there and defraud people I'm telling you it's demo I'm not saying that I did that with real money I'm just saying that I can read price action I can see these patterns forming and even with these other folks out there with fake mt4 servers and mt4 screenshots of making money and all this other fake withdrawals on I made fun of all that stuff I trolled those people on Twitter now I'm about to go back to Twitter this time I'm not going there with that intent I'm ready should someone want to bring it but I'm not there or going there for that reason the reason why I'm going to Twitter is I miss being able to do my small little vignettes where I would do recordings of me either taking a trade or reading price action and having some short little clip 40 seconds long or less of Music in the background I miss doing that maybe it wasn't always your cup of tea for my music choice but I have a very diverse palette for music and it's just one of those things I enjoy doing so it might not be worth it for you to follow me on Twitter or it might be I don't know but I kind of wanted to clear the air for the last time and show you all one more time where I don't need to do what fraud to do like I can I can see this stuff before it happens and you can learn how to do this too you can read it before it happens you can see it you can have faith that the things that you're learning here are rooted on Sound Logic it's not randomness it's not retail logic these are things that are algorithmic and I think today was a testimony to that so tomorrow's going to be very volatile be careful do not try to trade tomorrow you'll probably hurt yourself if you do or don't listen to me and learn the lesson the hard way until talk to you next time be safe

all right folks welcome back so today we had the chairman speaking at two o'clock in the afternoon you can see that here now I'm gonna kind of work backward today and I'm gonna talk about the one minute chart work our way back out to a higher time frame so it's kind of like a bottom-up analysis so uh ahead of the two o'clock in the afternoon fed chairman jawboning session uh we've seen this little Judas Point here and notice that it just fell short um the morning High and the high comes here at 12 5 35 and a half and over here in the morning session 12535 and three quarters so it felt one quarter of a point or one tick short of that high so it runs up after clearing relative equal highs then breaks lower no model short in here then the market drops once more below relative equal lows now what are these lows here these are the lows in lunch hour New York lunch okay here's noon to one and I taught you in the mentorship that many times when there's an afternoon continuation to the upside you'll see that the lows at lunch time will get swept and we're seeing that here now it dug down deeper into an area which I did a recording for Twitter today and my chart didn't have this I thought I had it because I was looking at another monitors but this is the imbalance that I was looking at that unfortunately doesn't appear in there but it's there obviously and it's below the relative equal lows and the market drops down below that and then all of this right here was manipulation and there's lots of manipulation initially the market rallies up and what I was outlining here is the time of the recording I had this actually misspelled had it racked they should be rigged as it should I think that's the right spelling I'm even questioning it again now but uh basically what's implying here is that long holders were raked across the coals not permitted to profit on the 12 553 in a quarter run so it starts off like it's going to go up to that level we were looking for and fall short of it and breaks down so what's actually happening is is buy stops are being triggered so anyone that wants to go long on like bull flag patterns and things like that or breakout Traders they're buying and then they're getting taken against their long withdraw down until they either stopped out or if they don't have stop-offs they get squeezed out so they can't take it anymore they just bail out below the relative equal lows any long holders from the morning they have trailed their stop loss below here so they take them out why because they don't want them being able to profit to the real move what was the real move I hinted at twelve thousand five five three and a quarter that was a draw in liquidity so we took out the New York lunch lows here and what I was suggesting here is shorts are about to be squeezed as it rips higher into twelve thousand five hundred oh that should be five five three sorry that's a misprint there you all know what that is because it's right here but I was being facetious when I was recording because as I was watching I was watching it run out then it broke down I was like okay they're gonna take the liquidity out below here and dig into this imbalance pick up some more orders I got one off as far as a long and a really poor entry but I was really focused on just being below these relative equal those I was fine and my stop was here because you'll see in the on my Twitter feed and you can find me on Twitter at the at symbol capital I underscore a m underscore v t h e underscore ICT in other words so anyway that little recording shows me getting in here and it's below the lows and I was out by how this is not a your favorite got to go short at and it's resistance don't look it like that it went up a little bit made a little notation and annotation rather that this was not resistance it's going to lift off from here and it went down to an order block started rallying and I was basically outlining the internal dialogue of those individuals that may be short from like twelve thousand five thirty and their stock also be right here and I was kind of like saying what would you feel if you were short from up here would you feel safe certainly you would feel safe but I said watch how that changes and then all of a sudden it starts running up and then in here we have order block it trades into that multiple times to realize that fair value Gap I outlined that it didn't get into it but I was allowing for that type of movement and then at three o'clock the algorithms will start to spool price in the direction for the liquidity which was that twelve thousand five five three and a quarter level which it hammers there and I'll put the business up right here and you'll see what you should be seeing what I told you my eyes are not that good oh here it is you saw about two twelve thousand four Seventeen and three quarters so just below this 20 Level here mainly focusing on this because I missed the opportunity getting in during this little imbalance there so that fair back out I wanted to be in it there but unfortunately I didn't get the position on in time and it was over here on this candle so I wasn't quick enough on the draw so the market trades back down into the order block and look at how it delivers with that fear of Vega look at that beautiful delivery revisits there with the order block rallies up pause send it higher order block sends a higher consolidates right below the target we've been looking for and then they pump it up into maybe here twelve thousand five three and a quarter and above and again fulfill an exits and that's the business there um let's go and take some of this off we don't need to see this anymore we don't need to see that anymore we don't need this and don't need that okay and I'm gonna take you to a five minute chart [Music] okay now it doesn't look so obvious in here as to what may be available but we just bumped below that high early on in the morning then broke down and all the liquidity resting above here was treating the retail market like hey you can trust us you know this is resistance it's not going to go up there and then when it starts to sell off like this notice that my model did not give a setup this morning or not this morning but this afternoon it didn't give this setup in here even though it didn't run by side it did sell off it did not give a setup notice that it's important to notice that so some of you are fearful what happens if I take a trade and it's wrong hopefully you see that not it's not like this all the time but you'll find that when the Market's really in sync these algorithmic principles will not appear in markets that are not likely to deliver as I'm showing you so it's not a fantasy it means it's not going to work all the time but hopefully you can see that there are times when the market does sell off but it doesn't give us a setup but then it creates the real move the other direction where you can find my setups and the formations of the Fairway Gap and such so obviously you can see that you know the market did in fact trade down into the imbalance on that one minute chart and it rallies from there into the 12 553 level we'll take that level off now and I'm gonna go out to a 15 minute time frame don't want to spend too much time here get an imbalance in here it trades down into that as well on the 15 minute time frame optimal trade entry here and realize that for the most high liquidity again aiming for that twelve thousand five five three and a quarter and we'll look at the 16 inch term [Music] okay in the market trades back down into all this here and rallies up and [Music] this was that area I was telling you about a week or so ago this is what we're looking for I mentioned that on my community tab on my YouTube channel and we have now just pressed up into that area so let's go over here and do this and I think we'll use this one as the higher one you can see we did in fact clear that in that's where that 12 000 I3 level and a quarter rather came from I'm not suggesting that we're making a high here to go lower the next area on the upside you know it's really sloppy over here I would look for this one here next and what is that high 12 6 24 even and if we start to really run we could revisit this area here but I'm not going so far as to say that for right now but just look for uh this one here that's that's a nice one to look for in the next upside right there I think that's a fair one too to anticipate and study and I think that is going to be it um no I'm going to show you one more time frames the daily chart uh can I get that to pop up um [Music] foreign relative equal highs and here we ran up into that so that's that whole business based on the daily chart as I was talking about in I don't know what episode was recently in the mentorship on YouTube so hopefully you guys can see that that is in fact what we were working with for daily bias uh yes you know the market did in fact create you know a big run lower and then create another run lower here but that wasn't my setup I was drawing everyone's attention up to that twelve thousand five by three level and this was the run that I liked and this is the one that was the hunt Okay and here's that little one here and there so anyway not a whole lot of uh money through that paper trade there's like a little over five thousand dollars in terms of hypothetical profit but hey it worked you know you guys can see that the effects of it and it's a little bit of an advanced idea but I did teach about the general factors that go behind PM or afternoon session trading if you're publish and it consolidates in lunch find the lunch lows wait for it to run that out and then they'll resume and it's right out of the teachings in this mentorship on this YouTube channel so hopefully you found this one insightful and I'll touch base with you again on Thursday Lord will

all right folks welcome back this is going to be a short little video on the s p 500 june contract 2022 this is our daily chart and before i get into it just let me remind you that i do not use whatsapp i'm not going to be in the comments section asking you to reach out to me okay hit me up uh let's talk none of that stuff that's all scammers so i'm never going to ask you for money i'm not going to direct message you i'm not going to direct message you on twitter okay all those people are just trying to scam you try to pretend to be me i'm not asking for your money you're here to eat off my table for free and i'm happy to do it so just know that those accounts are not me please report them and ignore them all right so the s p 500 daily chart we're going to look at this day here and before we get into it i'm going to bring your attention to the 16th of may on that low this morning on twitter i was not able to participate in the early session movement on the stock indices because i've been trying to do things to share with the audience that has been mainly following me because of forex i noticed a lot of you are starting to evaluate and complain that you want to see 4x and i understand that but even my paid membership group they have seen very little in terms of forex too and i'm pushing this asset class because this is where the volatility is price is price it doesn't make a difference when forex starts moving around big again trust me index futures will get you know slower and quiet in comparison to forex trust me when i tell you the currency markets will eventually within the next 12 months or so probably start having some pretty wild movement but until then we have to look for volatility where we can find it right now is in the stock index market so if you're a hardliner if you're a purist and you don't want to see these types of moves in this type of market i understand but learn from it because it works the same way in forex just know that okay so i mentioned on twitter that i was in the dollar cad this morning i went along on that one on its impact news at 8 30 and it was a snooze fest it took forever just to move a little bit obviously i shared that on the twitter feed so you can again go and look at that so i mentioned i was going to grab a bite to eat have some lunch and then i would look to see if there's anything for the stock in the sea market and i participated in this move i'm going to show you today here and i hinted at where the market was likely to go to and let me state this going forward because i had perry mason over there on twitter reach out to me saying that the bar has been lowered for calling out trades i don't call out trades i don't i'm not going to put you in a trade i'm not going to give you an entry a stop a target i'm not going to do that i don't spoon feed i don't do that with my paid group what i do is i point to where the market's going to go i've already taught you how to get in i've already taught you where to put a stop loss i've already taught you how to put your limit orders in i taught you all that now the problem is you don't have the experience of knowing where it's going to likely go next so this morning what i did was i drew everyone's attention to the low on the 16th of may 2022 now if the market is above and let's go into a lower timeframe chart okay and if we're in the market and we're up here and i'm suggesting to everyone think about this low over here on the 16th what do you think i'm drawing your attention to while we're up here and i'm drawing your attention to this specific area the lows of may 16 2022. do you think i'm referring to it as it should not come back down here no everyone should understand my style is we're aiming for liquidity so if it's up here and i'm pointing down here and taking your attention down there i'm acting like a scout you're the sniper in training whether you realize or not okay so i'm trying to point you to where you should be aiming and you have to do the work of scoping it up pulling the trigger and dealing with all that okay so there's no shortcut to this there's not going to be an ict on twitter or on youtube that sits down in front of you and says okay everybody are you ready we're all going to buy right now we're all going to put our stop-loss at the same place we're all going to put our exit or the same place and we're all going to ride these things and this is going to be happy and that's it i'm not gonna do that i never promised to do that i'm not gonna do a period in a story no way this is how i train my students it works folks it does not work for lazy people okay i understand that some of you just want to be handheld but that's not gonna happen with me i don't do it i didn't do it when people paid me and i'm not gonna do it for free either so you don't need me to hold your hand if i point to where i think the market's gonna go it's your job to study and look for the opportunity the fair value gap is what you're gonna be utilizing okay some of you are fixated on only looking for the setup at the opening well what happens if you don't get a trade at the opening can't you use a fair bag you have to get involved with the move if it's going to go down to something like this yes that's what i did today so let me add the annotations in the form of showing you the executions so you can see i'm not sure why this thing is not popping up stay on there there you go all right so here's where i entered i did four contracts at four thousand seven and three quarters aiming for the sixteenths low i didn't have a whole lot of time to be babysitting this thing and late afternoon this could have easily whipped up did some kind of a retracement if i didn't kind of stop loss trail down and then even move lower so just to make it easy short and sweet to the point your attention was drawn to the 16th the low on the 16th of may let's go into a 15 minute time frame all right so you can see up close candle what do you think that is right before we start to go to lower it's a bearish order block draw that out in time it hits that order block on this candle here dropping into a five-minute chart what is this doesn't look like a fair guy yet until you zoom in huh so right in here it's hitting it overshoots it granted but it's a lot of volatility right now this candle is high your stop would be above there hold on to the position until it starts to break lower if you want to fine tune it this is the one i shared on twitter in the recording so what i saw was this fairway gap here it hit it created what what is this what's this pattern here what's these three candles here it's a swing high so as soon as this candle closed here i'm gonna go right here at this candle and just get in and go short trusting the fact that we've already had a fair value gap we already went through it we have it swing high and it's bearish i'm looking for what what am i looking for i'm looking for a run below this old low which is may 16 2022 is low so entering here and i'm writing it out with a stop here everything is reduced in terms of risk as soon as we started to break lower here and started moving my favor aggressively i moved my stop only because the volatility is so high right now i just don't want to see it come back and knock me out that's not fear that's just sound money management i'm not trying to take a losing trade so here is the entry again it delivers on the downside i took my first partial here one off here and in the limit order you watch that fill on the little recording the vignette that i shared on twitter ultimately we started going a little bit sideways going into the beginning of lunch in new york here's your typical lunch time consolidation and then what's this stops ahead of lunch very valuable it's almost like uh it knows what it wants to do huh breaks lower consolidation again trades lower consolidation bumps to stops here what's this oh this ict just makes it so complicated hits it sells off sell side here consolidates one more time and trades and meets the low of the day i think when this one huh closed candle though at 39 10 not bad so that is what i did today i did not participate in the afternoon session post new york lunch this is all i had to share today right there there there and there okay that's gonna be it for today hope you enjoyed this and found it insightful until i'll talk to you tomorrow be safe

all right folks welcome back it's going to be a short little commentary on basically what i went with today giving commentary through twitter you're welcome to go over my twitter feed and go through it it's a lot because i was going all day long with it and i was kind of walking people through their own charts to kind of get a better feel for what to expect and where the real setup was going to be for today before i get into all that just know that everything that i said is time and date stamped so that way there's no time for worry about it and only the diligent are going to want to go through something like this and i put the readers on twitter through the meat grinder today i literally took them through every minor fluctuation explain why it should do this and should do that and ultimately setting up way before it happened uh the three o'clock to four o'clock short i outlined it in detail gave the reasons why it should take place everything's there and everything i'm gonna say in short highlight here is obviously found in the tweets so we have an outside day here yesterday big down closed day an outside day is a day that's higher than the previous day and lowered in the previous day's low so here's previous day's high it went higher his previous stays low it went lower so all of this range is outside of the previous day's range and it closed down when this happens there's typically this type of price action formation but it's really included with the odds in your favor if you're trading down to an old low but fall short of it okay this is usually where that double bottom idea comes in and it feels safe to if you're trading like me look for a run through that old low but if they stop it short it tends to be a choppy day especially if we have an outside date with down close so let's go into an hourly chart all right so here's the price action for today we're going to look inside this little tiny little fractal right here and i can zoom in here all right so we have old highs in here if you look at the high here it comes in at 39 33 and a quarter i mentioned that level today mentioned it a few times that we were going to trade up to that and i built the idea that looking at price studying in the way that i teach it it would be very easy to fall victim in this type of trading day whereas choppy it's listless trading back and forth and how to anticipate it what to look for and i want to go into the five-minute chart real quick okay and here's a five-minute chart and i want to add some annotations here so here is the 33 and a quarter level that's why that level was mentioned in the tweets this is the low at 38 72 and a quarter and the old low on the daily chart that did not get traded through is at 38.55 and notice we just fell short of reaching that at 38.56 so we went one handle short of that started trading higher and i mentioned how the market many times can present opportunities that look like it's likely to form a setup but it really doesn't really come to fruition and if you look at the range here okay i'm highlighting [Music] this theory that you got right there okay how we treated up into it started working lower created a small little fair value gap in here bumped into that traded lower nothing really in here to work with in terms of the model so nothing here is a short we were talking about all that this morning so as the market was trading around in this area i mentioned how it was likely to be a 50 50 probability that means it's likely to go higher just as well as it is likely to trade lower okay so what's the benefit in that obviously anybody can come into it with a 50 50 expectation but it really statistically moves to 50 50 when we start trading back into the middle of the range okay so this imbalance here the fair value gap it should have offered a little bit more movement lower why wouldn't it go down and take out this short term low it went below this short-term low here and then started rallying working towards the relative equal highs over here i mentioned early on that it would go to 39 33 and a quarter that's where it would go but i favored in other words in terms of bias for the longer term i favored the 3855 level down here for sell side i don't think that they're done with it down there but we have to take every single trade idea based on its current dealing ranges and what's a dealing range well dealing range would be like from this high down to that low and we measure those yes it trades up into that imbalance and trades down to a short term low that's a tradable opportunity there but it's not very clear after that it just goes back and forth chopping short-term lows are taken high high is taken here we trade back and forth all of this is really ugly type of price action and i mentioned that we would go to you know 39 33 and a quarter back here and it ran right up into it cleared those relative equal highs broke down traded back down into the range and i started talking about how the real setup that would be formed by my content by the things that make sense in the algorithm would deliver a specific framework today i told everybody on twitter you can go back and look at it to take a vertical line and add it to three o'clock new york local time and four o'clock and that would be the setup that forms to take us back down into [Music] the middle of the range now i tell everyone the tweets to study the middle of the daily range okay so what does that mean if you look at what the high was and the low okay right in here if that's the middle of the range we ran above the short-term high so we have relative equal highs here and relative equal highs here so there's buy-side resting here i outlined how the market would use the running up to take out the buy stops to squeeze anybody that was short and trail their stop-loss down and also to induce people into thinking it's going to go higher so that way it builds up liquidity below these lows what kind of liquidity sell side liquidity because they're going to protect their what long positions but the main thing was focusing on the middle middle of the range here so if we're looking for setups that are going to be based on a run above for buy side and pull back into the range it needs to be specific in terms of time i gave a very specific window between three o'clock and four o'clock in the afternoon so we go into an out uh i'm sorry i'm an hour we're gonna go into a minute chart okay and you can see here the market rallies above bumps into the buy side liquidity smart money uses that to go short this is exactly what i outlined beforehand it's all in the tweets it's not ambiguous it's very specific i tell you exactly when the trade is going to form i tell you exactly how it's going to happen i'll tell you the framework the logic the narrative everything it's going to pull back to the middle of the range here is the breakdown here let me take this is this a swing low yes is this a fair bag gap yes does it trade back up into that range yes it works lower back into the middle of the range let me put this back where i want okay and if i add the annotations you can see right there i sold short at 39.40 and three quarters and i took four of them off at 3908 and three quarters middle of the range and you can see there still is a position there with partials taken off already and the limit order down here at 38.55 it doesn't matter if it goes down there now i don't care but i have a position in play should it do so and i want everyone to understand that there are people out there obviously who want to say stupid things because they either want to get a rise out of me or they're they feel that their competition and they want to get in a you know a lot more attention for themselves honestly you know if you want to build the tension around yourself just do things that weren't people's attention placed on you but for anyone that obviously did not spend time with me today this is going to be rather boring it's going to be pointless to you but i walked through all of the things that days like this where it's choppy okay where it's just going back and forth back and forth this was not read wrong i purposely took everybody in to the marketplace through their own chart and told them to think about what was going on in their own mind what other traders would be thinking so that way you could really capture what it feels like to be in there looking for your own setups and try to think critically about it i outline in advance where the setup based on the things i teach up here where it runs the buy stops we pair with that and then pull back to the middle range and it does so beautifully all of this in here is really hard choppy price action it's very very difficult to trade in those types of ranges because they can come back on you stop you out and just go nowhere for a long period of time so if you know what you're looking for in terms of what the algorithm is going to do and the algorithm on days like this this is called a consolidation day and what happens is this the market starts trading creates an initial range and then stays in that range until the afternoon at three o'clock it used to be the bond close that started this whole thing but now it's just three o'clock at four o'clock when equities close the closing bell that sets the tone for on close orders so what that means is what was going on prior to three o'clock the market was rallying up what did it go up for the buy side liquidity but traders gonna look at that as a breakout to go higher and they're going to pair that with the market participants that are considered smart money so that's exactly what i outlined this is exactly what transpired everybody in the twitter feed we're following along i mean granted there were a few people and you can go through and see who they were they weren't really paying attention because they came into the conversation late and i went a long day today just tweeting between tweeting uh what you don't know is i had my son sitting next to me and i'm outlining things to him and i'm explaining what she takes but should take place rather in the marketplace plus i'm also sending out tweets so my mind was divided between all of that so it was very difficult not only to predict what you all were thinking and thinking about what should be transpiring in price action plus literally walking through with my son what to anticipate expect and see in price action and through his lens uh he was actually executing in a live account uh he has his amp account linked right through trading view so you can trade directly right from the chart so he's plugging away on my laptop right next to me and his account was able to grow from six thousand dollars at the beginning of the week now it said ten thousand dollars that's real money that's live money and you know when i when i hear about people that say the stuff that i teach doesn't work or if i can't call the market and when people sit there and they spend the entire day with me and i outline everything and i outlined this very specific trade here way before it even forms before the market even went up there i'm explaining all that that it went right to where i said it was going to go run the stops then sync it back down the middle of range go back and look at the tweets i can't edit them and i'm not deleting anything okay so if i make a mistake a spelling error you're just gonna have to deal with it because you know i don't want any deleted tweets zero so if you'd like to follow me and all that stuff just save everything and save it all i don't care the point is i want you to save them as what exactly what i said the last time i was on twitter save my tweets save them because you're gonna see things that prove obviously what i'm talking about it proves that i have the visibility that i can see these things beforehand and there's a lot of people out there that will just not want to put the work into learning this because it seems too hard they just want to put an indicator on the chart and you know that's all i want give me a macd give me a stochastic moving average and we'll call it a day but they don't give you logic and narrative they just give you a crunching of the numbers and that type of thing isn't in my opinion not very beneficial because you're you're beating up the data of price action versus reading and understanding what the tape is and that's exactly what i was doing today with everybody on twitter so uh there is an application that i was made aware of on twitter that allows someone to do i think if i'm not mistaken they call them a space or spaces or if i said that wrong forgive me i'm not going to edit this video but apparently there's something on the twitter app that you can kind of like talk and i think it's just audio where you just talk and people that are i guess following you on twitter they can hear you talk so i guess i'm in a way it could be like an ict squawk box you know i can kind of like talk out loud about what i'm looking at what i think is useful it's not a trade setup obviously or a signal service type thing because that's not what i do i know i don't do those things so we were studying price action together over my shoulder through tweets and uh this was the move i was outlining well in advance early in the day i was setting the stage for all this back and forth motion that they're going to drive it higher to squeeze out traders that were already short from previous day and trailer stop loss right above the old high back here they bumped it here on a very shallow run let me take this off they bumped it on the let me take everything actually these relative equal highs as it dropped down they trailed their stop-loss those that are short so they ran out and bumped it on a shallow basis and then one more time they ram it up in there and clear them out real nice so the logic i was teaching was that would be utilized for smart money at the close between three o'clock and four o'clock so they ran it up there all the buy orders that were resting above here are here in the form of protecting short stops or not short stop short positions acting as their stop-loss order when the market trades above that those buy stops that are protective in nature they become a rushing liquidity wave okay of willing buyers at the market so willing buyers at the market at three o'clock on a day like this where it's consolidated it's going to want to go back to the middle of the range and that's why i posted until we did study the middle of range of today's range okay so when you look at that type of event it's going to range bound trade between here's the 9 30 or so right there okay so the low of the day there and the high the day there so split that in the middle there's your midpoint and it's going to want to gravitate back to that so when you look at price action days like this and if you're caught up in it you know what you're doing or you feel like it's just being chopped up wait until three o'clock because many times at three o'clock to four the algorithm will do something where it goes outside the bounds of the daily range like it did here okay it trades up into it and then rams it down and nobody's really allowed to make any money anyone that was long freaking out here gets raped across the coals anyone that's short gets knocked out with a stop loss and then a losing position and most of the time traders are too afraid to go in here going short where people that like myself i outlined today in the front of you know 20 000 people they all seen it they all watched me call it and there it is there's my phil there's the middle of the range partial and i got two in float and just for the sake of completeness i'm just going to take one of them off while i'm doing this recording so that way i don't have to worry about it at all you can go to my stop and or go to my limit and either one's fine by me i don't care okay so i'm going to try to do a little bit of tomorrow's session i'm not going to spend the entire day obviously because i have other things that take care of but i've scheduled in today because i had to work with my son and his analysis and learning all that stuff so i was very proud to see him pushing the button on his account he did very very well had one or two uh hairy moments where he wasn't thinking like i was hoping he'd be thinking and had a losing trade was able to recoup that and push this account to over ten thousand dollars so i'm very proud to uh see him engaging and doing his own thing and trying to figure out this stuff on his own so yeah i think we'll talk a little bit through that twitter application tomorrow i don't know how long ago but uh we'll see what we get from that and i think that's going to be it for this one until i'll talk to you next time be safe

all right folks welcome back this is our final meeting for the week and this completes my daily review for the 2022 ICT free mentorship on YouTube series all right so we finally made a run below that May 12 2022 low here and I want to take your attention in to the hourly chart all right so here's the trading day for Friday and we'll look at this when we get to it all right so we've Consolidated Market ran up took the stop on my final balance on that paper trade we moved up into a deeper fair value Gap creating the high of the day we broke down below the 3915 and a quarter level now for me this was the the turning point that I required like I didn't want to do anything prior to the this run here I did a commentary on the Twitter spaces uh portion of their service or whatever where you basically just get to hear someone talking and I just Jawbone for a little while around 8:30 to 10:00 I spent about 90 minutes just covering a lot of different things from psychological things to personal things and trading and you know how my children are with the exception of one um not really interested in trading but now I have one of my sons that are actively pursuing and now obviously you know he's given me permission to show you his account here um it's a it's a live account there you go you can see uh he got his account up to today here so previous balance I was mentioning and showing you earlier so do a little clip on Twitter previous balance after commissions he had 9,751 66 and today he added another $33,700 to it bringing this balance to $ 13,451 66 that would essentially be in 3 weeks like 300 100% return or number one spot on the robins leaderboard in less than a month now obviously amp allows you to trade with a amount of Leverage that is you know exceedingly lower than that of what Robins would do that kind of return obviously is not typical okay I'm not promising any of you that you're going to get that and yes he's my son so he has a lot of experience sitting next to him so when we're looking at charts together um I'm kind of like leaning on my experience and asking him what he sees basically what I'm doing with you all when I'm training you okay I'll prompt you I'll say what do you see here and what do you see there so that way kind of it builds his understanding as the charts are painting and he gets to push the buttons on his own decided whether you he wants to get in or get out and there it is and today I was utilizing That Swing Low there so I wanted to see that break so during the time on Twitter I wasn't really interested in anything until that low was taken out and you can hear that in the discussion um I'm wanting to see this low break I was giving it an opportunity to see if it was going to show a willingness to come up here and run these highs I could have very well happened hit that and then did all this business here U but it just so happens that it breaks the 3915 and a quarter level here and then right in there I'll explain how I personally would have been involved and how I actually was talking to my son about it and these types of ideas helped him you know Propel his account today the market trades below the short-term low here took some sell side out there and then ultimately taking out the 3855 level rather handsomely and we'll look at all this business when we drop down our time frames let's look at the 15-minute time frame all right so here's that fair value gapit worked up into I wasn't interested in all this business back and forth chopping around finally with the 3915 and a quarter level it broke through it and then we had a gap in here which we'll see on the lower time frames that was in my opinion the better trade now some of you are going to look at this and say well it didn't go to a premium I'm teaching you how to find the highest probability and also trusting the model I'm not limited to just one model okay so I I kind of like want to preface it by saying that I don't want you thinking that I'm just this onetick Pony that I can only do what I'm taught in this model I know some of you want me to sit down every single day and give you the example of that model but to do that that takes away that Discovery for you like you got to go into your charts and find them and then by building a backlog of old data showing those types of moves it helps obviously with your confidence it builds your own pattern recognition and it's just that's just the way you are supposed to do it period you know I'm not going to do it for you I'm not going to hold your hand for you I've taught you what it looks like and how to find it where it forms so that way you go through it and you look for it to form in your own charts and collect the examples of it that's back testing so anyway it runs through 372 in a quarter creates another opportunity in here you can actually see the fair value Gap there trades up that's another short worked lower finally creating the short-term low and at 1:30 that's when we start watching the afternoon PM session bit rallies up creates short-term high in here fair value Gap the last hour of trading rallies back up into a fair value Gap here so if you look at the range from here to here it goes back to a premium I taught you that so that's a Target this imbalance Fair Val Gap reversal on Friday's trading up into an old imbalance there okay so my son participated in shorts in here he took two shorts and went long in here all throughout this and was able to again push his account up $3,700 today if we go into a five minute chart here is that same idea where it went created the low 130 it starts doing its business what's it reaching for going to go back into the middle of the range into a premium this is the array above half the move from here to here is 50% equilibrium and this is the premium level so it goes down small little drop down in here into the fair value Gap after 3:00 and then the market starts sending it into an algorithmic spool where all this price action starts running aggressively into the close up into a completely random level that was shown on the on the hourly chart and here we have the market trading right up into that area and then just consolidating going into the close so now the idea of looking for a setup let me go into no let's go into this little area right in here here's that fair value got there it rallies up into it there and there then breaks lower in here there's a fair value Gap it trades up into it there and sells off notice that it's occurring at the levels that I have here on the chart those old lows where sell side would be resting so we're using the fair Bay Gap after a run Below on think of it like support broken return back into the fair Bay Gap not listen folks listen not go back to the old low broken and act as resistance okay that's not how I look at if the fair Bay Gap doesn't exist I don't trust that level as an old support broken turn resistance that's why I try to everybody that comes to me oh he's just trading break and retest or he's trading support and resistance I'm not because I classify specific levels beforehand looking at them with the logic that the Market's going to create these patterns around them same thing here old low the fair value Gap it trades up into it it Why didn't it just stop at the 3872 on a quarter level because it's going into the imbalance here then deliver is going lower so the two shorts were in here in here the Longs in here here and then riding up into the imbalance okay and it's real hard to beat a live account proving it and it's all the better when it's your own son pushing the buttons and seeing it happen so that's just a really good feeling as a dad so hopefully you know with what I shared this week um I gave a lot of content and today I just wanted you to understand what it was and why I was not willing to take a trade yet because I wanted this level the 3915 and a quarter level to be broken I wanted that to happen first and to do that because on the 15-minute time frame that gives me that break whereas all up here it's just it's Consolidated I don't want to catch a a break below a short-term low and then then run relative equal highs notice that that's the reason why I'm picking that because I know you're all asking why didn't you use any of these short-term lows being broken you could have if you want to be ultra aggressive I wasn't willing to be ultra aggressive because we have a lot of volatility in these markets right now so I want to know that I know so this short-term low that's why I hadn't noted I told you about it in the commentary today listening to me on Twitter breaking through you don't see the Gap here on the that time frame but it's appearing on the 5 minute chart and that's what my son employed as his trade and then down in here there was another trade and down in here there was another trade and then here is a trade so the key levels that I note they're not just indiscriminate levels they're levels that are built on the logic and it's based on liquidity not support and resistance it's liquidity the orders I know are going to be there based on the logic that the Market's likely to do what it's going to reach for that 3855 level only if we break below here and then we have a fair value Gap and then we break this level here and does it get another fair value Gap yes and then delivers even more so it's a matter of all these things coming together as a Confluence not just one thing you know leading to that's the conclusion that's the uh the exercise of the pushing of the button it requires a lot more things and that's kind of like what I was helping you with yesterday and hopefully this morning if I was successful at least I was hoping I was successful some of you are really uh coming back with feedback on Twitter saying it was it was helpful and You' seen it some of you actually took trades some of you actually did demo and paper trades and and you see it you actually participated in it but when I said this morning when I was closing the presentation on Twitter where I was audibly heard you can't see my charts I was kind of like discussing things in certain levels what I was saying was I don't have a setup yet it's sloppy and what it was doing is all of this in here okay so as we got to the 10 o'clock hour I told you I wanted to be off air at 10 o'clock because I'm anticipating the algorithm taking that low out and it does and then it creates the pattern I taught you which is the fair value Gap we have the displacement and I want to see it take off now if you look at this displacement leg here you're going to want to measure that and say well okay it didn't go to a What premium I don't expect it to go to a premium in here because it's going to be in a hurry to do what get down below that 3855 level for the week so let's go one more time back into the lower time frame actually the first time going in the lower time frame scrub back [Music] here okay so here is that return and the defair Val Gap here so when it does this I'm looking for it to move quickly away and start gravitating towards the other pool of liquidity down here if you're looking at it from the relationship of short-term dealing range this swing High That Swing Low we have our fair value Gap here it trades up into it there and that level 395 and a quarter so it's a Confluence of several things but the level itself just highlights where the liquidity would be the imbalance is what I'm keying off of and what I'm focusing on so equal equilibrium or above is What premium that's what this is here okay that's on one minute chart so don't be discouraged or look at it from a perspective that hey you know the market didn't go to a premium you just don't have the experience to see it yet you gotta you have to do this for a while folks it isn't a watch one time and then you know it like it it takes some effort on your part but I promise you if you work at it you're gonna get it you're gonna get it and then once you have it you can't forget it it's like riding a bicycle okay so hopefully this has been insightful to you hopefully you learned something this week hopefully I was able to uh Propel your understanding a little bit beyond what you were thinking was about all you're going to get from me for 2022 I have obviously some more things I want to share with you but hopefully you know you enjoyed this week with me and I'll touch space with you on next Tuesday Lord willing until then enjoy weekend be safe

all right folks welcome back to all this showing off stuff all right so today we went through the process of watching and analyzing the opening price on es and i mentioned on twitter that i was interested in this old high back here that's largely linked to the fact that we had a gap when the session started again last night my local time about six o'clock and we got down and then it just drifted lower had a small little rally in here smt divergence i'll show you that in a moment but in here we have the market creating relative equal highs it broke down i gave you the fairway gap live this morning on the live stream walk you through the whole business of running out the cell side and the opening gap on sunday which is over here so i don't have that on my chart so let me just drop that on real quick if you don't mind me working as i go i don't want to be doing any more edits than i need to and i don't think you might be doing it in front of you so we can see what i'm showing you all right so the market trades down below the sell side here and into the sunday gap opening we traded through it all the way down to another favorite gap hits that there comes back up runs back up into the opening range drops once more into an older block rallies take the short term high retraces back down into another order block let me stretch this out as you can see a little bit better that's not as cluttered as it now all right and we worked off this order block this order block which you'll see when you get in the five minute chart it's a little bit cleaner here and here and rallying up into the level i was mentioning on twitter this morning so i'm gonna drop into a five minute chart [Music] okay and there's a favorite egg up i gave you live beautiful delivery look at the low on this candle right here right up here look at this value right here 39 26 and three quarters this candle trades right back up to what value the high now on this candle 39 26 and three quarters folks that is absolutely perfect that's perfect price delivery okay i know i'm kind of known for the forex market showing things like that to the pit that type of stuff it originated really with index futures bonds and index features so in the 90s i was utilizing these same tools i know it seems like it just came out of nowhere recently because i've talked about it but these things have been under my control my my ownership if you will for about three decades so it's nice to be able to share them obviously with all of you and it's very well i guess the word is fulfilling to show it to you to walk you through it live so you can see what it is what it looks like and yes i have a lot of people asking me why don't i give trade signals can i run a trade signal room please i will pay you can you do this and can you do that no i'm not going to do that okay i don't want to be in another paid service type thing okay i'm sick of it i don't want to deal with that no more i can make all the money i ever need trading and to be honest with you i don't really need to do anything anymore anyway i'm padded out so just enjoy the fact that i'm wanting to teach i love teaching i love sharing with you and i know it is helping a lot of you so just let that be the economy between us okay i like doing it you like receiving it it doesn't cost you anything so there you go so when we hit the sphere value gap it broke lower and then once more return back up into it well not into the fair value but up into that range here and then broke and i gave you a small little imbalance and we'll look at in a moment we traded down into the sunday gap i mentioned the lower end would be this time the level to watch and so if we went down below it come back up it'll act as what resistance it does so here we'll look at lower time frame drops lower once more hits the old fairway gap i showed you before we dropped into the five minute little bit of consolidation ahead of lunch typical retracement during the lunch hour all the way back up to the opening range broke lower small little swing low broken back to rebound and also look what it's doing here folks it's going back up into that old gap opening on sunday trades up into it access what resistance trades lower down into an order block big down handle right there that's the one over here hits it starts to accumulate rallies up back above what level here i'm gonna make sunday's levels really really obvious it's going to be obnoxious actually so i want you to see what was going on in my mind as i'm watching price okay price goes above the opening gap or gap opening rather from sunday then trades back down into it see that hits it rallies falls short of what the relative equal highs over here retraces where does it trade down into that gap opening again now we're at the discount low it rallies comes back down in fury value gap trades into that this is a 15 minute order block rallies and what's it go to the 39 52 and three quarters level hammers it beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful in the afternoon it became a lot better in the morning it was sloppy so when i say things are sloppy it just means that it's not really giving you a whole lot to work with i mean you have very few options and you have to know exactly what you're looking for i.e what i was giving you this morning and this area here watch how it should stay open and it stayed open basically the whole thing this is sloppy even though it's a nice delivery it's not giving you all of the mechanics of entry like this one here this one here this one here and then run to the objective i was drawing your attention to today so the morning while yet it was still potentially profitable and i was able to call it for you live that really wasn't my choice session because it was just i didn't have a real clear view on what i wanted to see this morning one of the followers on my twitter feed uh a lady asked you know why was i talking about 39.53 level i rounded it up one quarter point above this level and the high comes in at 39.54 and a half so off by one and a half points so our handles so i was more interested in the run to that level versus just going down to the sunday gap opening or the old london open lows their trades there obviously and you can see i can see them coming it's not a matter of you know missing them because i don't know that they're there or forming my interest really lies with what is the setups that i'm liking the most like what is it i'm looking for specifically and the level i gave you that 3953 level i want to see a run up into that so we had to come down below and then back above sunday's gap opening and then it treats it as a dynamic support resistance level did you just hear ict that's blasphemy he just talked retail that's a cuss word around here well i'm talking about in a way where you'll understand it so the opening gap on sunday if you put it in your charts and just plot it across the entire week you'll see that many times there's a lot of valuation around that gap so it'll be treated as a dynamic price level if it's above it look for it to act as support if it's below it look for it to act as resistance and if you can find a swing high for instance we have these here we trade down okay if it's going to trade down into the sunday gap opening look for it to run about here there you go you don't need to have this level that i pointed out this is enough relative equal highs and relative equal highs over here so i've taught you how to find those bicep liquidity pools but i taught you today with this lesson using that sunday gap opening and just extending it through the entire week sometimes the week will just run away from it and won't really come back to it but in weeks where there's consolidation like fomc we have that uh to deal with for this calendar week and those types of events create these choppy range bound range bound markets that don't give you the real clean take off one-way directional move you have to know how to trade in these environments okay so obviously my tools do very well in this in this environment too but let's go down into four minute chart [Music] actually it's going to three and now let's go down to two minutes there it is i forgot what time frame i was looking at good grief all right so we dropped down to a lower timeframe here's the two minute you can see we have a fair value gap here i mentioned how i didn't want to see it come back up into that once we moved away go back and watch the live stream recording it's on youtube unedited it's exactly as it was done at the time you can see i was fumbling around had no idea what i'm doing um before i get in any further in this lesson and lecture understand this i am not buttering you all up to do these a lot i don't want to do them a lot they take a lot of my time they distract me from my own trading and my own personal life so i understand that doesn't you make you feel good because you had a good time today and maybe you learned something yesterday too but the other live session but i showed you what it looks like i showed you how you go into the marketplace and you read it and i'm gonna leave it up to you the viewers decide whether or not if these things work okay you don't need me holding your hand the worst thing that i could do is sit down with you just a few times a week or even once a week that would create such a co-dependency on me that it would not help you and to be quite honest with you i knew as soon as i did this i would get complaints and emails and things you know we need you to help us take live trades we want you to do that you're being selfish you're being ignorant you are you know self-centered because you won't tell us when to get in when to get down folks i didn't do this for that type of feedback okay i only promised i would show you that i could show you the things before it happens that way you can see what it looks like and there's nothing that's required you know to trick anybody i mean either it's going to work or it's not going to work but you have to be in front of the charts doing these types of things and failing is part of that that's how you learn these are opportunities to grow from that so anyway um i think that is it i want to go back up to the 15 minute time frame and talk a little bit about this area up here that gap i think that is where we're going to be drawing up into because this is in my opinion not going to be left open okay so they're going to want to trade back up into that there's missing data here okay there's an actual gap so it'll want to draw up into that and what to what price level i'd like to the low on that candle okay so if it was going to be a perfect delivery it would go right to that candle's low but i'm not expecting perfect i'm not suggesting that at all but if we go above this area that means we're probably going to go into a deeper run on the daily and [Music] let's take everything off here so we're likely to run this high here and we have another block there so the low at four thousand so that's something to consider and watch going forward for the rest of the week i may be wrong you know it's just something for you to go into your charts and start studying and looking for um i think i have one bit of business oh let's go back into let's go into a five-minute chart [Music] all right um i was watching hannah on her youtube channel and i don't know exactly of him what market was i want to say it was australian dollar maybe it was canadian dollar but something it was a 4x pair i don't need to have that on the chart to explain what i sell are doing and some of my students when they first come in to the fold they do this type of thing too they will look at a range like this like here to here and they'll measure that range low to high to find the 50 level and then use that over here for a discount that's not how we do it okay if we are looking for a short in anna's example she was looking for a short you want to look at the price leg that drops and this is going to be the reverse of that okay so this might be a little confusing but just reverse the logic and you'll understand i'm sure hannah will follow along so from the low here up to this high here if we're looking for a long to get above these relative equal highs and or use that 3953 level i was calling for or making reference to this morning this low up to this high this is what you'd be doing okay so if you're looking for it to go higher you're going to need to draw your fib from a low up to a high that dealing range from that low that a high we're waiting for in anticipated retracement so the retracements going down to and below 50 now this becomes what a discount so you can be hunting along at this level or less if we're into a fair value gap that's good okay uh the same thing is done here if we're looking because it has not taken this out here yet just fell short of it so if we take the fib and just anchor it to that high and run it to here you can see here's 50 of this dealing range low this dealing range high and it drops down to a discount okay you're looking at expansion swings okay or impulsive price swings in the direction you're trying to trade you don't want to use a price leg from high to low measuring something that you're trying to go long one but you don't want that you want to be using the impulsive price swings that go in the direction you're trading then it retraces down in below 50 or add it into a fair value gap then you can probe that as a long and rallies up so i just want to kind of clarify that i wasn't sure if she was aware of what she was doing but if she wasn't aware that now she knows so that way all of you have had the benefit of learning through her interactive study which i'm absolutely loving i'm loving it um i wish more of you would do it and as long as i had time to to sit down usually it's on the weekends that i get a chance to catch up to stuff like that but i'm loving the thailand vibe i'm loving the you know the booboo kits and not so much the food poisoning sorry for that but hopefully this has been insightful to you hannah hopefully everyone else has got something from this as well and i'm sure i'll be back again lord willing on thursday until then be safe

all right folks welcome back so lord willing after the holiday weekend i'll be back next tuesday so here we have the e-mini s p daily chart and you can see we have a nice delivery to the upside and this will draw what's inside this area in here up into the bearish order block now notice that we traded up into this up close candle with today's range didn't quite take out this high i think that's the next area to look for but in here when we're looking at a candle that we're using for like an older block the low the open in the middle of the range those are the three sensitive areas that you're watching for if the market trades up into the middle point of that candle this is what i call the mean threshold mean threshold was taken today and that to me bodes well for a continuation to take out this short-term high so if you take your fib and you run it across this candle to 50 level all right here's the 50 minute time frame here's yesterday's trading turned up into that small little area down here into that low i mentioned that was going to be a likely candidate for upside relative equal highs as well we traded back down into a fair value gap optimal trade entry rallies up takes out buy sell equity above the short term high back here which i don't unfortunately have in my chart but you can see that on your own 15 minute timeframe and then we consolidated ahead of today and then during the crossover into new york midnight a small little judah swing where it drops down increase the low of the day rallies leaves relative equal highs in here and this high intact it drops down rallies once more small little retracement and then it does a shallow run above 4 000 on this pass through here in this small little area on a lower time frame i used this little retracement to highlight a run to 4 000 because i gave you guys 4 000 was my objective it hit it and then we press deeper into the order block on the daily chart which creates this whole run here now i'm going to go into the details about that here but for now just know that we were trading up to this level failed to go to that same level consolidated right below that daily bearish order block that's the low of the candle that creates that daily bearish order block and then the opening when that counts a little bit higher i think it's four thousand two but don't pull me to it look at your own chart so we have a small little pass above four thousand retraces back down in we'll look at the lower time frames in all of this price action now into the five minute candle this run here to here this price leg is part of this price like okay notice how this candle is high to this candle's low that range okay that range right there has one single pass whereas this one has one two notice that low high small door retracement and then a second level running because i had two stages to this delivery i want to use this most recent one and this is my dealing range the short-term low the short-term high i ran a fib on that and i showed this in the short little vignette i posted on my twitter by the way the twitter handle is i am the ict okay so it's at symbol capital i underscore a m underscore t-h-e underscore i-c-t okay it's a lot of people over there pretending to be me and maybe they're just you know i don't know if it's fanfare or what it is but uh some of them have been asking for money i'm not asking you for money and i'm never gonna ask you to dm me i'm never gonna dm you okay so if it ain't being posted publicly on twitter it isn't me all right so this dealing range here i measured the low to the high 50 is equilibrium i want to see it drop down into discount this small little area down here value gap we want to look at that on the lower time frame so from this run here to here i know some of you are going to ask some of them we're bringing it up today on twitter what about the times you said for the model um teaching you something that is outside the model as the reasons why you're not going to anticipate or see that typical setup that's the whole point of why i did it today plus i have a lot of personal things that take care of and administrative work in my private group so with that said the market rallies in here drops down in the fair value gap there once more above the 4000 level and then going into here's 8 30 by the way this is 8 30 candle and you can watch when it trades right into that very value got it rallies again it drops back down in and then at 9 30 this candle here explodes to the upside takes off and starts digging deeper into that alright so it traded up into almost the 4074 level looks like almost so we'll be looking for a continuation of the upside 4095. 4100 is next consideration i want to take you into the price action down in here and give you more details as to why i was willing to take something a little bit earlier today okay if you plot the nasdaq june contract for 2022 and on the compare chart on trading view if you go up into your trading view platform you'll see like a little plus symbol up here if you click on that it'll give you an opportunity to add another instrument and you add this symbol here nqm2022 and then it'll plot a line chart but it's usually going to be applied on the close it's like a default you want to change that in the settings by just right clicking over here or highlight over top of it it'll give you like a little gear or something click on that and change the settings to and just change it to plotting on the low because you're comparing lows as you can see the nasdaq went lower here whereas the s p failed to go lower that's an smt divergence okay smt smart money technique it's accumulating in here whereas the nasdaq is taking liquidity out so there's a cracking correlation between the two usually they move in tandem but at certain times what times 8 30 9 30 at news events being released okay they'll create this divergence and if you have a bias it's helpful but if you don't know where it's going you're going to many times encounter what would look like smt divergence and then it disappears as they start moving in concert with one another so you have to be careful with that that's why i'm teaching that's why i always teach know what it's reaching for okay the bias has been bullish and for my framework for my setup because i gave you 4 000 and i had very little time to work with anything this morning i just hurried up and saw the chart i missed the actual ideal entry i just used a close proximity entry with an owner block and there you go so if you look at the relationship of that fair value gap dropping back down in higher low than that of e30 versus the lower low made in nasdaq this is a stop out this is accumulation of longs this is going to be the telltale sign that it's going to go higher if you look at what we did on 830 it already snapped down into this gap and it's not likely to go lower than that there's no need to okay so it's being compressed basically like a spring or a like a more like a bomb really i hate to say it you know so crude but that's what it is it's like waiting and then all of a sudden it explodes it's waiting just below that daily bear shoulder block and it's digging up into that thing at range on that up close candle on the daily chart so it's climbing up up up up and we watch to see if it gets to the main threshold which is half of that fair shoulder block or up close can on the daily chart i was making rappers to be in the video all right so again we can see zoomed in price breaks back down into the fair vega after trading through the order block here this is a 15 minute time frame motor block by the way and then it rallies inside this little area in here there's one small little pull back into a fear making a one minute chart i'll leave that for you to go into and study and here is the hourly chart i want to kind of give you like a market structure perspective here's where it's likely to be drawn to next all of this movement down here we completely rebalanced all that here is the fair value gap i had drawn on the lower time frame chart just a moment ago before we move back up to an hour chart we have consolidated here ahead of running all the way up into this area here so notice what was happening we had to low retrace down into this low to high discount very value gap rallies dealing range low dealing range high retraces down into discount rallies dealing range low dealing range high discount fair value gap order block rally consolidate we rally come back down into the smaller time frame if you're vega snt diversions and rallies and keeps pressing higher heart higher so my question to you is how many of you first didn't listen to me when i said don't trade two did you try to sell short why the bias has been bullish it's likely to do what keep digging higher we try not to pick tops and look what this has done we've had a low a lower low a sudden dramatic low that we came back up had a shift in market structure here then we retreated back down to this imbalance so we're seeing the market do what keep going higher keep going higher picking up discount levels each time the algorithm is picking up more accumulated longs to press deeper into all of this range and likely trade into the buy side liquidity here so you have to know what you're looking for narrative and bias also what in this area or over here would constitute a short because we have all this range in here that it's not likely to go up to go straight all the way through all this stuff that's a high resistance liquidity run not that it can't happen but it's likely to not form or pan out because we had so many supporting ideas in here down closed candles are supporting price it's just finding underlying order flow that is bullish so it's likely to go up just to keep going higher not go up to go down because to go up to go down we have all of these ranges that we would have to pierce and break and that requires a lot of well intent not selling pressure okay and the intent is to send this thing higher on the daily chart which is why i took your attention to that initial gap on the daily chart so if you found this one insightful and hopefully you learned why today the range expansion took place why was it not as short we've been bullish we've been looking for prices to go higher and just for clarity let me go back up 4000 was my objective only because i mentioned 4000 during the commentaries this week so when i was talking to you in lectures i called this level so i wanted to give you a point of entry and then target hitting it and that was the whole point of me showing you a little vignette on twitter today showing you that i love what i was looking for how to frame a trade how to set it up and you engage it because it was setting up this trade here okay just for your notes because it gave nice run here earlier before seven o'clock in the morning that means we're probably going to have a deep retracement and look for an ideal scenario like we outlined with the smt divergence so smt usually will occur around a 9 30 time period when there has already been a nice early run before seven o'clock or at seven o'clock so we got real close to seven o'clock here but i'm not and i'm not limited to this model i know some of you were questioning you know with kind of like pointed remarks on uh twitter you know what are we doing here why are we not using the time frame that's used for the model i'm showing you again just proof that these things deliver as i teach them now i have not only taught what i've revealed on youtube i have lots of students i have students in my paid group i have casual people that come through and you know watch one video or two videos and i want them to see things that's being taught from my library of concepts so if i can see this setup early in the day before the seven o'clock in the morning to me it gives me insight it gives me an expectation around what the 9 30 opening is going to be like so if i get an early run like this my first thought is i need to go to smt later on at 9 30 because it's probably going to require some kind of a cracking correlation to set up the next lake if it's going to have one okay it's thursday tomorrow's friday we're going to go into a holiday weekend i will not be trading tomorrow i will not be trading on monday i'm going to be doing one video for my private group tomorrow and it's probably going to be an early video not so much a commentary for price action because you know it's a weekend and memorial day is on monday so the volume is probably going to be light on friday so if you're going to be trading you study in the morning session lead the afternoon to in the gamblers volume just probably won't be on your side in the afternoon everybody's going to be going away for a long weekend and don't trade on monday take the day off enjoy it have hot dogs hamburgers relax do what you got to do to be a family person i'm going to be doing the theme and until i talk to you lord willing next tuesday enjoy your weekend and your holiday be safe

all right folks welcome back the continuing ict 2022 free mentorship on youtube and i'm taking you into the e-mini s p futures contract for june 2022 and i saw questions in previous videos where they're asking about june and we're in the month of may these contracts are delivered by contract month so we're about to in a couple weeks end trading of june contract then we'll roll over into september 2022 contract but we have a couple weeks still trading june toss that in there for no extra charge all right so hourly chart obviously we are looking at a swing low here to swing high getting our range here's equilibrium so the market did in fact drop down into a discount and a pair of a gap so we have a market that is in what an oversold condition do we need an indicator to plot that or determine that nope absolutely not the rectangle is there just to draw special attention for you the viewer the fib is just to highlight exactly where equilibrium is anything above that level would be considered premium anything below it discount so we've moved from this high down into a fear of a gap and below equilibrium so we're in a discount all right here's the five-minute chart and notice that we had this run up in here i mentioned in twitter and again my twitter feed is not a signal service so that way we understand one another but i was highlighting the idea that this was likely to go higher and it needed to go for a premium relative to this high and that low so we moved up into a premium then we slid aggressively taking out relative equal lows so below this low here and here is what sell side liquidity it was quick to do that rate the opening at 9 30. short little bounce then one more time below the low here taking out cell side for anyone that wanted to capture along here they knocked them out then we had a shift in market structure and then rolled up even higher rebalancing all of this drop back down into an area here where we have a five minute pair of a gap trade's not into it i mentioned on twitter that we would likely trade higher and take out the short-term high here and here so imagine the morning high that's this here that was going to be the draw on liquidity and we saw that run here and actually went a little bit higher than i thought it would for the morning ultimately up into a fair bag up here for a really really deep premium from low to high straight up into that and then pull back inside the range between this low and the high so on a one minute chart we're zoomed in here and you can see the morning i did a small trade here i recorded this did a small little vignette shared it on twitter took partials here at the time of posting the tweet and then the limit order getting hit here then the only other trade i had today was waiting for it to drop down to a discount and when it did i went long here had a little bit of heat here not much it was like five handles so bearable stop loss was just below the swing low over here so did it hit it no did it look like it was going to i don't know i wasn't looking at the chart at the moment it happened to trade here i don't care but i ended up coming back up and i mentioned that we would run this high right here because we've taken out the cell stops here after running higher so we had a shift in market structure back here earlier and then we could basically consolidate and drop down to take out the cell stops so anyone that was lucky enough to go along here and wrote it up to here the algorithm drops back down clears the board taking out the cell stops below here i'm buying those cell stops i had a little bit of heat here we rallied and i mentioned that we would start going higher now because we've cleared out the cell stops and going over into the one minute chart with a little bit more detail here's the initial drop now here's what i want to bring to your attention we had a short-term little shift in market structure here and i know some of you see this and you see this one here which one's the shift in market structure well i'm playing the run up here to a premium like i was mentioning on my twitter feed this morning so if this is a range i'm working within the shift in market structure occurs here when it takes out that high drops down into a fair value gap which is what i bought i didn't believe we were going to take out the lows here because we should have done it at 8 30 news it didn't do it so this is deep retracement and then sent it higher to go into a premium right before 9 30 a.m and then they sank it down notice there's no model entry here that's telling okay it's tipping its hand to you because there's no real setup and it's a rush to get down here it's clearing out sales liquidity going down rallying suckering in longs trying to pick the bottom knocking those individuals out now they are not allowed to be long their stops taken nobody in retail usually will take a re-entry after something like that they're afraid it rallies up comes down to a fair value gap shift in market structure here rallies relative equal highs drops back down in very very good order block rallies once more goes into the imbalance here consolidates bumps up just above the short term high here then drops one more time clearing the liquidity out here and you see my entry was at 4120 on five contracts and again here is the tweet okay and i'll have the link posted in the description below this video so you can click and see it and it's time and date stamped that is exactly as you see it here all right so it says salsa liquidity is taken free to run to 43 and a half that's this level here while i was here so continue on first partial which is when i tweeted you can see that in the timeline this morning three contracts were sold at 41 39 and a quarter and finally the final two were filled on a limit order at 41.43 and three quarters and ultimately it wrote a little bit higher which was fine i was juggling a lot of administrative tasks this morning but nonetheless you can see all the trades are here in here so was it a lot now but you know hopefully you guys learned something today we have a non-farm payroll scenario this week its first week of the month transitioning from one month into another and i typically like to have all my trading done by wednesday and because i've done what i've shown here today i'm satisfied with this particular week now some of you are going to be like this is crazy you have wednesday still you have thursday still yeah friday you're welcome to do that but i have to be disciplined and being consistent how you get there is having rules rules and engagement so you're welcome to practice but i'm not trying to hunt anything more this week because frankly it can go either direction it can go higher or lower based on that daily chart so because i don't have a clear definitive objective i'm going to sit on my hands and just be content with what i've shown you all here today and that's going to be it for this week i'm going to be finishing up with my private group i have a lot of things i have to fulfill for them and it means i'll be quiet on twitter and i'll be quiet on youtube until thursday i'll put another video up on thursday evening until then be safe

all right folks welcome back hope everyone's doing well so we are in episode 37 of the continuing series of the ict mentorship for youtube 2022. here's our daily chart for the e-mini s p june contract for 2020. and you can see we have worked inside this fair value got this is also a breaker okay breaker is a low high low or low find the high in between extending out in time the market trades down into that it's also coming down in to fill in this fair value gap so we came down fill that in and now we're starting the rally next bicep liquidity is this short-term high here and then if we can get some acceleration from the upside we have relative equal highs up here and that fair value got okay so for the students here that are looking for a little bit more meat on the bone for bias okay when the market is moved from a low like this and starts to trade higher and creates a swing low it's easy to assume that it might want to come back up to this high here so notice how each day with the exception there's one single day here each day was bullish okay so the bias would be expected to be bullish until we take out this high it does that here then we have a day or two of retracement which is logical because we created a fair value gap here it trades down fills it in once more tests it and rallies so we're looking for tomorrow which is friday non-farm payroll is a day i do not advise anyone to actually try to speculate on now there's going to be a group out there that have said i've made money doing a non-profit payroll trades my reasoning for telling you not to trade is because you're here to learn how to read price action so if i say go out there and study non-farm payroll friday price action which can tend to be very volatile choppy or sometimes it becomes a dud it doesn't do anything but you don't have the experience to weather something that's very volatile and can be jarring to you okay and if you're out here trying to gamble with live money which is what none of you should be doing if you're in here learning how to reprice that's why you're here to learn how to read price months from now if you come to the conclusion that you think you've done well enough on paper and then demo consistently if you decide to go into live trading you've done that on your own i've done nothing to instigate that or try to get you to do it okay so bias is going to be derived from this chart here because we're likely to run this short-term high that's what i'm thinking i'm expecting that it could happen overnight there's there's nothing saying it's going to wait until tomorrow 8 30 when non-farm payroll comes out but if it doesn't run out this high tonight at 8 30 if we're above the fair value gap high here in other words the candle sticks low here if we're above that level at 8 30 and we have not taken out that high i would expect price to try to make an attempt to get to that level it doesn't need to go through it but the bias would be i would expect that to be attempted okay now does that mean go out and try to trade not for a payroll tomorrow no a lot can happen from the time of this recording which is a little bit before nine o'clock eastern time in the united states so i'm not trying to trade not from payroll okay i'm not instigating any interest for you to go out and do it tomorrow but i do believe that you should study it try to determine what side of liquidity is going to reach for before 8 30 news release and when that volatility hits the marketplace watch and see what it does on like a one and five minute chart get a feel for what it's doing and it's an amazing study for liquidity purposes only but unfortunately sometimes these moves can appear well to the untrained eye random and then to the initiated here sometimes the patterns that i'm teaching you in the logic materialize in the chart and sometimes they do pan out to script but not always so the reason why i tell everyone to avoid like big days like fomc and not from payroll weeks is because you don't have the experience and you can get hurt very quickly not knowing what you're doing so i try to be responsible as a mentor try to protect you from yourself because like i was when i was younger it was very easy for me to fall into a trap or think i can do something i couldn't so that way you understand i try to teach my students to stop trading by the new york session on wednesday so if you had something that was profitable quote unquote up to that point stop trading for the rest of the week and then observe just study the price action the rest of the week but don't try to push any buttons because you don't have any experience working in these sometimes very challenging market profiles on the thursday and friday of non-farm payroll weeks they can be choppy they can be sporadic they can come back against you when you really don't expect them to and they lose a lot of their precision not all the time but most of the time they lose their precision so i want to be focusing on those days where i don't have those disadvantages where everyone else is like well i got time to be in front of the charts so it's gamble and it's casino time and that's not the way i do things and i'm trying to promote the idea of a super mindset about what it is you're dealing and respect the measure of risk so be mindful of these levels here the two blue lines here and that red line here it's a little bit lighter than these you won't see these on a lower time frame but this here is that short term high here and the two blue lines here are respective to that fair value gap on the daily chart [Music] all right hourly chart e-mini s p market trades down to the discount low the fair value gap again these levels here are not drawn because of the basis of support resistance on an hourly chart okay these are the same levels that i drew on the daily and my change time frames from daily to hourly they transpose to these levels here respectively okay so the market trades down on wednesday hits the fair value gap low then we consolidate and then we drop one more time to it here then we make a debt mad dash to take out the short term high here we have a shift in market structure that's bullish we take out this short term high here and relative equal highs and now we're gravitating towards what looks like a run on the buy side here now it does not need to do that tomorrow i could be wrong about that i'm just saying that i think that this is the next draw on liquidity so study that that's all now we do have a small little fair value gap in here be mindful that you might want to drop down into that before going up there that's certainly something to study also all right on the 15 minute time frame you can see here this is the markup for the short-term high here on wednesday's trading we hit the fair value gap low on the daily chart went back hung around in consolidation rallied up and i was in here trying to get a feel for what it wanted to do i was thinking that i could capture a run to take the buy side out here that's what i was aiming for initially really early in the session and this got chopped up a lot in here and it's fine i really don't care about that but once i realized it wasn't trying to rally and they we're going to try to take it once more below the new york midnight opening which is this candle here i want you to take a look at the way this day formed before i get into any more discussion about it we open here consolidated rallied up and then dropped down into the fairway gap low on the daily chart and bounced there rallied up took out the short term high here and kept on rallying and enclosed here this formation of price action is what i dub my ict power 3 where it's accumulating manipulating distributing so it's opening create the low of the day and then rally now if you see this pattern on a daily chart it's easy to understand but when you look at the lower time frames it's easy to get lost in all the candlesticks and all the volatility and the movement and the quick fluctuations on these one minute and five minute charts that's why the uninitiated will look at and say it's noise it's it's not noise okay it's doing what it does on the daily chart just being represented on a smaller interval like a one or five minute chart so if you lose the context of like for instance the levels here and here you won't understand that it's dropping down to the higher time frame key level which is the very very cap low then the market can rally higher but once i got on side i shorted from in here and covered inside this candle as we were dipping below the short-term low i forced myself to engage not because i'm breaking rules not because i'm undisciplined but because i want to teach you why i avoid these days because my precision drops precipitously i don't have the the visibility on these particular days that i do have on others so if you have a built-in advantage why would you go to an area or arena where you have built-in disadvantages if you have advantages by trading on the days that don't create these types of conditions you trade in those arenas and then that time frame and you avoid the times where historically your proven walk forward real trading results have been diminished on these particular days so how many times you have to have your flesh torn open and bleed out before you realize this is probably a time of the month where i shouldn't be doing anything or lower my expectations in terms of the measure of precision so over 30 years that's what i've come to trust especially as a mentor teaching other people how to read price action i really press upon my students to stop trading on wednesday by the new york session so if you haven't bagged anything by that time from sunday's weekly open until until wednesday's new york session begins don't do any trades and deal with that desire of wanting to trade but don't do anything that forges discipline it forges patience and it also teaches you especially when the weeks are really bad and it doesn't give you a whole lot of movement you're going to be rewarded psychologically and emotionally because you didn't do anything but on twitter i've coached those individuals there too and i said don't take any trades don't do it and today they did and they regretted it so some people decide to listen to me after the pain but my whole point in doing these types of lessons in lectures is to try to spare you from all that you don't have to go through the same things i did painfully to learn the lessons so listen okay it's for your benefit so anyway i went short in here and i shared that on a vignette little tiny little video clip where you can see the uh the business and the executions and such but the the afternoon that's set up i want to go into that a little bit and i didn't buy anything down here i didn't do any of that turn here i was actually shopping for some things that i need for the summer so it took my attention away from being down here but once i got back to the screens and i saw the market dropping down into this area here i tweeted and i asked everyone on twitter if they could find the five minute fair value at the above price and i gave them a minute or two and i shared a chart in case they were confused as to what it was being discussed so my expectation was we're here and we were likely to drop into that in the pm session so in other words as we going into lunch and on the other side of the lunch we could have easily traded up into this area as an upside objective and then i didn't mention it but you obviously know if we get above that movie the next logical draw on liquidity it'll be about this high here okay so on twitter if you want to go over to twitter you can see this is my handle a lot of you guys keep asking i've already mentioned it on several videos now but it's the at symbol capital i underscore one time am underscore t h e underscore ict i am the inner circle trader or i am the ict so you don't have to follow me on twitter i'm not looking for a lot of follow since i'm not trying to get everybody to follow me in fact you can just go to twitter.combackslash and put this here in without the at symbol and you can look at my tweets they're not protected so that way you don't have to join that platform okay so i know there's a lot of people that simply will not join because all the politics is associated with it i get it but we're over there having fun and hopefully you know you guys can check it out and join the fun if not then that's cool but it's a little bit more time friendly and easier to be alerted unlike the community tab on my youtube channel i'm not really sure why sometimes people don't get notifications and sometimes they do i don't know so when you guys contact me or send me messages through tradingview or whatever asking me there's things i don't know okay i just put videos up or posts and if you get them you get them if you don't you have to go to the actual community post and see it but twitter obviously has always been my playground i've enjoyed it in the past and you can see here the time 11 37 a.m this is local time eastern time and june 2nd i asked everyone on e-mini s p five-minute chart locate the fair value up above market price that's this one here okay so i gave a little bit of time for folks to look for it themselves and then i gave this here okay so the market was trading right there and draw on look what it was here okay so obviously you can see here we did shortly after that it was bagged and tagged was it was trading up into that level there so the question is going to be what's the purpose of that you know what's the whole reason for me bringing it up you know that's not a trade ict that's not a a button being pushed that's not a an entry a stop and a target right i'm teaching you by being your spotter sometimes i'll see things and i'll say look at this or study that for clarity folks that is not a trade signal i'm not telling you to buy or sell anything i am trying to inspire you to look at price with the things i'm teaching you real time at that moment before it actually develops and delivers in price before your charts actually show it i'm taking your attention to the right side of the marketplace i'm pointing to a level i want you to study where we are at that time at market price which is in this example here and then study how it gets to that level i'm sometimes going to be wrong folks okay admittedly i'm i'm gonna do it wrong okay but i want you to study from when i say take notice of something and study and see if it wants to deliver that by a specific time okay i've noticed since um i'll comment on something on twitter it's almost like it immediately runs to it so that's also an interesting thing for me i'm not sure what to make of that but i know once i say something it's really quick to be johnny on the spot and get to where i'm pointing to so i'll leave that up for you to decide if it's anything noteworthy behind that all right so this is a two-minute chart and before i even get into this this is not a trade entry and this is not a trade exit okay if you look at the shape of these arrows okay i'm not trying to defraud you i'm not trying to fake something i'm not trying to pretend that i took this trade okay i did not do it i'm just showing you graphically this is how you would have your chart so if you want to journal things after the fact what you want to do is you have your chart set up like this and you have an order block the down closed candle prior to this move up here and then we drop after consolidation into the fairway gap right there right here is where i tweeted look at this very valuable so price was here that was the moment of the tweet and then up to here it delivers so the pattern is this okay so when you have that you go back into your charts you mark it up like this and then over here you want to put down any observations how long did it take before this move started to be delivered to the upside after it went into the fair bay gap well this each one of these candles is two minutes right so it went into it here here said it's four minutes and then six minutes and then starts delivering six minutes after hitting it and then it took one two three four five six seven eight nine roughly 20 minutes to deliver that expectation and price so it went from a discount how's this discount we moved from the low to here think about what's being shown we are above the new york men like opening price so the market dropped down to a discount creating the low of the day now we above this opening price and we're going into lunch here is the new york session lunch hour so we have time before 12 o'clock for this to potentially deliver but i was giving it time see if it wants to go there in the pm session which will be on the other side of lunch around one o'clock to 1 30 and then start to deliver that but like i was mentioning moments ago lately when i post or talk about anything it's like it wants to get there right away so again make of it what you want but after you have your annotations on your chart you want to basically put down any observation that you notice but you want to phrase it in such a way like you saw this in advance so what happens is you're tricking your subconscious into believing that this is a experience that you really had and it's like self it's called self talk okay you're reassuring and reinforcing something that would be a positive thing for you and while you may not have seen that trade and you didn't have the experience that i was showing on twitter today before it happened you borrow that experience for the study but in your journaling your chart would look like this okay and then you would fill in these little areas where it where it would draw on your observations the things that you saw come to fruition and never try to put anything negative in it don't say i wish i would have saw this or i was foolish and i didn't see this unfold and i missed another trade or i'm never going to get this this is frustrating these journal entries are for you to reflect upon at a later time and you want them to be positive you want to basically cheerlead yourself in your journaling and keep things very fact oriented everything is a matter of fact and you want to phrase it like you saw it beforehand and over time how much time i don't know but when you do this for weeks and months maybe half a year or so certainly by the first year of doing it you will have tricked your brain into having all of this pseudo experience the benefit of this because you're logging the chart and making it look like this and retaining and then referring back to them each weekend looking at the previous week looking at the previous month and just scrolling through your charts and reading your annotations yes it's laborious yes it takes time yes it is boring in the beginning but when you start learning to see these things form live then you'll understand the benefit of having done it because this is how you get it nothing else gives it to you watching my videos will not do it for you you have to be in here doing this part if you fail under my tutelage it's because you don't do this okay this is where everybody that fails starts their tailspin into failure they don't want to do this stuff they're like i ain't doing that i ain't got time for that well then you don't want to succeed because i'm telling you there's no shortcut around it you will do this or you will fail period and the story have a nice day now notice what we have here we have a short term low here during the new york lunch hour we're consolidating the market drops back down and takes out that short term low we have unfinished business about that old high here this is a stop run here and it just slowly drifts up and takes that old high out the only setup i liked was obviously the short and the re-entry in addition to the short i did and you can see that on the vignette that i posted on twitter so i'm not going to bog the video down here with that it's already made public the afternoon session or after the low was formed notice there's no model entry for what i've taught you so far but we have a nice fair value gap with the continuation of the upside with a fair value gap i was pointing out real time before it happened so this would be the only other setup which i did not take it's i didn't trade this in a demo account i didn't demo trade it but i did give you the logic to look for real time in twitter before it unfolded so this is the framework that you would have in your journal and everything i mentioned in this lecture tonight hopefully was insightful to you and helpful and i will touch base with you again next tuesday lord willing until i'll talk to you next time be safe

all right folks welcome back our continuing series on the 2022 free ict mentorship on youtube we're looking at the e-mini s p june contract for 2022 daily chart all right so i'm going to teach you a little bit about intraday profiles and daily range and we're going to be using this idea here so initially on twitter if you were following me on that platform and i mentioned how i was going to start the day looking for a potential run to 40-70 okay so 40-70 was my initial draw on liquidity to see if people want to reach down into that level if you look in this area here that's my fair value gap and you can see we traded down into it here then today one more time you shoot it into it left these relative equal lows in place and then started to move higher i took everybody's attention to previous days high and this high here and if this continues to go higher i mentioned this before i can't recall what video but i know i mentioned it in here this is where we could potentially draw up to for our enemy term target our objective but i'm not cosigning that just yet right here and here is enough okay so we're expecting higher prices after this shift in intraday volatility so we'll look at that now going into lower time frames all right here's the hourly chart you can see how we [Music] did not take these relative equal those out i want to see it go down there that's what i was looking forward to try to draw it into that it didn't do it it did not give a setup either based on the model i'm teaching you so i used the intraday volatility and the framework to kind of like teach it today a little bit more about bias how to change gears with your bias how to also manage your bias okay so initially in the beginning of the morning i was looking for a potential run to 40 70. it gave an opportunity to tape read quote unquote paper trade or even demo using the draw on liquidity but the model itself didn't materialize okay so because i'm the author of these concepts i have a lot of tools at my disposal and i have a little bit better understanding of price delivery than the average student of mine so if i go in and i show you something in this lecture today the main takeaways before i get into is this what did i do and how do i go about abandoning a specific bias how do i change gears if it is applicable sometimes it's not applicable to reverse it just means moves or sidelines and just say i'm not going to do anything and what are the characteristics that would lead to a bias that is changed and how do you use that logic going forward and how to navigate the new york lunch hour okay so we're going to tackle those topics in this video all right so notice that we had this low here taken with this run then this low was taken with this run and this low was taken with that run so notice what we are seeing we're seeing multiple lows get taken and then the market reverses while offering really no high probability shorting opportunity the 4070 level never got tagged liquidity left in place okay previous day's high which is here that high was not traded to so we have a high of 41 68 and a quarter then we have a fair value gap over here so you have two premium arrays that may be a draw on liquidity that takes it up in the air and maybe even run above these relative equal highs all right on the 15 minute time frame you can see how we just kept going lower than the previous lows and then finally we had a run higher so we had a short term shift in market structure relative to the 15 minute time frame remember that's our bellwether chart so it runs higher creates a fair value gap in here and trades down into it here okay one of the things i want to kind of bring to your attention because a lot of you are familiar with a gentleman by the name of chris laurie and he talks about liquidity voids where he teaches how the market wants to come back down and fill all that area in as you probably noticed i don't teach that i teach obviously there's times when that can occur but because i understand the algorithm that is not likely to occur most times okay so it's important to know where the market's reaching for and then look for these imbalances in price and then what makes it a fair value gap is the fact that it's coming down into this area here or inside this area here or this area here or this area here so they're all fair value gaps it's a fair value to buy it if you're bullish okay i'm not trying to insist that these imbalances completely rebalance that's one of the main differentiations between me and chris laurie now i'm not knocking chris lord because i believe if you want to learn price action it's basic and goes beyond the average retail stuff then you can learn from him uh he's the only one i really give a nod to in technical analysis and as far as education and i send people there all the time i don't have a relationship with him on a business level and he doesn't give me any kickbacks i don't ask for anything i just think he's a generally nice guy okay so there you go but there is a stark contrast between what he does and what i do and how i teach so there's a there's a degree of precision that is given to you when you understand the things i'm teaching you it goes beyond simply imbalance rebounds while that is important there are times when that is a factor but what i'm teaching you is where is the market likely to go to okay i'm not trying to teach you entry patterns with a importance that getting in in a specific price level is the most important factor i'm teaching you how to determine where the market's likely to go to next where's that draw on liquidity now there's a lot of different ways that that is calculated on an institutional level okay and how it's determined it's not buying selling pressure okay but it is algorithmic so the easiest way for me to cut through all of the very complicated things that could very easily bog you down and you may feel like the things i'm teaching are complicated and i guess when you remove the idea of putting an indicator that says your overbought oversold or crossing over two lines that gives you a buy or sell you know it's not in my opinion wisdom to exchange a decision especially if you ever decide to do this with real money it's not wise for you to determine your bet or your gamble or your investment on what an indicator is saying versus reading price action and getting the logic behind what it's doing okay and that's narrative what is narrative narrative is the understanding of what price should do why and what things will it encounter to prove that the narrative that you are assuming is in place is in fact underway now that's a mouthful i'm sure most of you probably didn't get much out of that but i'm going to break it down for you i was looking for 40 70 today to see if it can get down outside the range of that daily fair value gap and we failed to do so and then the market shifted higher now the whole time i'm looking at the market it's not giving me any kind of short i'm not comfortable taking any kind of short and all of a sudden the market does this okay no panic no i'm missing a move no you know calling somebody else or reaching out to somebody on a social media platform and ask them what do you think's happening i don't worry about anybody else's opinion you shouldn't worry about anybody else's opinion either you're going to learn how to trust yourself so we had created a fair value gap here on the 15 minute time frame so right away that is your area to watch and see if price supports a run if it digs into that and starts to repel higher and we take out this short short-term high that is enough to set up a stage for the afternoon trend okay that afternoon session move or set up or price swing that's what we're looking for now because the market failed to go to an objective we were looking for it was respecting that daily fair value gap and it rallied up and what very valuable is that it began the video i showed you on the daily chart here it took out that short term high so now we have an absolute market structure shift bullish with this swing high and the market comes back down in here and rebalances this very very yeah now i'm not looking at and this is where one of the instances where resistance broken turns support but it digs a little bit past that okay notice that it goes down into my fair value gap not stopping dead in its tracks right up to high notice that so i'm not looking at support and resistance i'm looking at the fact that we went through this short term high created an imbalance and then we treated that into that now when we get in this area here i'm interested in looking at intermarket relationships i want to study real accumulation and distribution okay how do i do that i've already tell you we're going to go into the lower time frame five minute chart all right so here's the five minute chart as you can see the market did you know drop down i did real quick sudden move after i tweeted saying that my initial interest was 40 70 and it started drawing lower and then went one more time here at 10 after nine took out that short term low there and then started rallying higher at 9 30 opening and then we dig down into that 15-minute time frame there you go so it doesn't look like a fair bag gap in here notice that but i want you to go back to your 15-minute chart this is where the work is required on your part in this price run from here to here on that 15-minute chart look at your chart and shade that in on a 15-minute time frame and then drop down into the five-minute you'll see how it drops into that shaded area so we're working from a higher time frame 15-minute bellwether chart into a five-minute chart this is running into that fair value gap now if you're just staying on one time frame or at least not carrying over higher time frame analysis into your lower time frame you're gonna be trading blind you have no idea what you're looking for now i know what i'm looking for because i have multiple charts in front of me multiple monitors and i'm i'm panning around when i do my recordings like i did this morning you can see that i actually executed the trade you can see where i got in you can see the actual executions you can see the little arrows that show where i got in i show the price and you can see the partials along the way and the whole business okay so if you're not following me on twitter you don't need to follow me i'm not asking you to follow me but you can go to twitter and you can see that that is uh in fact shown to you there short little vignettes i call them stingers okay i do small little uh segments of me actually treating or i'll do analysis or commentary without really seeing anything and i'll play music behind it because i'm having fun i'm enjoying myself hopefully you guys are here on twitter having fun with me if you're digging it and you're enjoying yourself on my twitter feed give me a heads up in the in the comments below all right so anyway it digs down into that 15 minute time frame for everybody gap here and then rallies higher then it starts to trail off and goes down into this imbalance right here now in that little stinger video i draw this little area out with a rectangle and i do a small little box up here okay and what that box is is if it goes down into here and starts to rally i'm going to take half that position off once it gets into this area here again okay i don't need to go above this short term high so that's what that little red rectangle represents when you see me doing that stinger little vignette video in my twitter feed i'm drawing your attention here so when we go from this level here if it starts to rally up once it gets back up in that area again i'm going to take half the position off and then see if it can run about that high okay so that's what i was drawing today i'm drawing reference that's that way when i talk to you tonight because this is our tuesday lecture i'm showing you now what it is i was referring to and why it was there also if you scrub back over here you'll see it's an old area of bicep liquidity here and it's a fair value gap over there too okay so that little rectangle here is drawing special attention to me reminding myself that over here there's bicep liquidity that is not showing in that video that i'm recording in an imbalance over here so when it runs back up into that this old area of bicep liquidity this might be just a stop run and they're going one more time passing into that level so i want to make sure i get half my position off because i could be wrong like i was wrong about 40 70 didn't trade to it well here at 10 35 right there 10 35 right there i tweeted i said note your previous day's high okay previous day is high is here so if we add the annotations back to the chart and we'll remember that 4168 and what price is that 41 68 and a quarter so that's our high that we're likely to draw to that's what i was kind of drawing everyone's attention to and i'll not add the annotations back all right so here is what i had in the recording i shaded this area in here it was a like a shaded box i just drew these really prominent lines here so we can recall that to the pair of head gap that i showed in that little vignette video and i want to talk a little bit about new york lunch okay i gave you rules of engagement when you're trading the afternoon session and primarily what i gave you for the model was a morning session idea but because of other people asking me and inquiring hey can you teach us a little bit about the pm session or the afternoon setup i started bringing in some things now if the market starts to go higher okay in other words if we've been in a bullish market structure and order flow is bullish that means everything's going in one direction the market's obviously going higher on all time frames then that's in the easy trading scenario but we're inside that little trading range area on the daily chart last few days you know or a week or so it's just been hanging around that smaller range so you have to know what you're doing or you're going to get caught up so initially i wanted that 40-70 level we failed to go outside the shaded area here that's that daily fair valuable so i've added it here for your edification notice that these lows here here this is lower than that one why is that important why am i drawing a distinction between those two well if you go and you add your nasdaq chart overlay you'll see that this is a divergence so even the s p was relatively stronger than that of the nasdaq nasdaq made a lower low here okay and i'll show you that before i close the lecture out but for now this is that five minute chart returning back into that 15 minute imbalance so that's there for your edification as well this is the opening price at midnight that's what that level is now i teach if we're bullish we want to be buying at or close to the opening price okay now here's one of those advance ict things okay if you know that the market is likely to go down to go up then you can wait for price to give you this type of setup right here where it goes down shift the market structure come back down into a 15 minute time frame if everybody got this is intraday or day trading it is not the model i gave you where it is a scalp essentially that's what that is the model i've provided for you for this youtube channel is a scalping model that's exactly what it is but if you're going to day trade daily range you're going to be using the 15 and 5 minute chart and there it is now you can use that model that i gave you for entries and scalping you can use that as your entry criteria but with the logic and narrative that you're going to trade in the daily range okay so if we're bullish i teach and i have taught on this youtube channel multiple times my power three concept is if we're bullish we're gonna be looking for the opening price at midnight is going to drop down create the low of the day it's forming it at 905 i'm sorry 9 10 new york local time it rallies up shift and market structure so it doesn't give me my objective but it gives me these clues here now whole time i'm i'm not tweeting to you i'm studying christ i'm working with my son and i'm measuring all these things because last word i gave on twitter was i was looking for 40 70. no problem no trade either but i mentioned that there was no setup there's nothing going on and then the market rallies up okay what i was looking for it didn't reach it and it didn't give me a setup did i lose any money did i take any kind of a a painful ego twist to my arm no was i wrong in the public eye well some of you may think that because it didn't go to 40 70 but if i'm looking for something to deliver and it doesn't give me a setup last time i checked if you don't put a trade on did you lose no if you put some skin in the race and you tell the public what you think is going to happen it doesn't happen do you lose well it depends on what your audience's mentality is if they're looking for face value yeah i was wrong about 40 70. you hear that ict didn't get something he thought 40 70 didn't print no problem i don't need to be right the smt divergence here in the higher low versus the lower low in nasdaq comparably and then we have the shift in market structure we treat it back down into the 15 minute fair value up here and then we rally once more once i saw that then i'm good to go i'm waiting for the afternoon setup but now watch what's happening the market rallies uh fall short of 41.40 that was another level i gave in that little stinger video on my twitter feed so i'm going to come to the google and check that out and then it drops down into the fair value gap starts to rally but look what it does it leaves these smooth relative equal highs and then does what drops once more below that short term low now think about what i've given you in your notes as it relates to trading the pm or afternoon session if you're bullish generally what will happen is the market has ran higher in the morning then it consolidates into the lunch hour then after the lunch hour it'll drop down and sweep to sell stops or below some short term low or the lows made in lunch okay now watch what this does here it creates a low ahead of the lunch hour at noon then it drops down into the fairbank gap is that not doing what i gave you in terms of the rules of what liquidity is doing in the afternoon post new york lunch when we're bullish yes what's different it's not consolidating see that is this a consolidation no it's a retracement so if you can identify an area where it's likely to retrace and some of you asked on the twitter feed why am i measuring from here to here to get this versus this here to here well you have to bring in what i'm trying to do i'm training the daily range i'm trying to get the majority or the alliance portion of the daily range so because i'm doing that i'm factoring in that midnight opening price so we've went above it here and once more so i'm not expecting it to go back down below here again so to refer to this low now again is pointless i'm going to use this one here for market structure so market structure swing low here to swing high that's my dealing range so that's why i outlined that one here okay and i gave you that small little rectangle here drawing my attention in there in the video here to go back what i mentioned moments ago that that's an old imbalance and it may stall here it may fail here it may just consolidate and then run for previous days high you know on wednesday so i want to take half my trade off which is what i which is basically what you saw me do but anyway it's taking out that short term low on a retracement but if it was consolidating into lunch i would look for the swing lows during the lunch hour and then wait for it to drop down sweep them like it's doing here and then rally but because this is a retracement going into lunch that to me it signals that they're going to work through lunch what does that mean years ago when we were on the floor only open outcry sometimes the floor traders would know that the mark was in a hurry it's a fast market so they're not going off the floor they're going to stay busy on the floor and they're gonna be trading so i learned this from an actual floor trader so i'm i'm not making it up i'm not you know listen you just giving you some kind of garbage made up or some contrived nonsense it's based on what they used to do and that same mentality has been transferred into electronic trading so the algorithm does that same thing here during the lunch hour if it's a fast market it's retracing back down in to a random fair value gap it creates a short term low and then it runs the only short term low that's there from here to here this is too narrow we don't want that it's already moved too much and it's going into that hour ahead of lunch time noon to one new york local time so i want to see it retrace back down into a discount how is that done from that low to high so the algorithm reprices to a discount once it gets to here then it does what creates that short term low rallies a little bit leaves smooth highs in here so what is that they think that is resistance so anyone that's short they treat their stop loss here and drops one more time right below that short term level what's below that short term low i have already told you here cell stops so i'm thinking like smart money this is going to go higher in the afternoon i didn't take anything in here in the morning and i was not correct in where i thought it could reach for which is 40 70. if it would have went to 40 70 you know what i would have done said there's your 40-70 and you would have asked did you take a trade or the cynics would have said but you didn't take a trade that's not what i'm trying to teach you i'm not trying to teach you entries i'm teaching you the logic on how to read the markets that way once you get this skill set down the entries are the easiest thing to do they're that's the easiest thing to do but you have to know how to read the market and also tell when the market's turning and what is if it's turning where's it gonna go and if it's gonna go higher where will setups form i showed you that today right on twitter right there in front of everybody now the market drops down into the sell stops here and it's inside that fair value got and it's happening in the lunch hour now i had things i'd take care of and i was going to be away from the screens as i was and i didn't think i'd be back before two o'clock but i was managing that trade from my cell phone and you can see that cell phone trade management in the short little vignette you can see the stops being raised and i'm taking partials along the way the whole business but as it's going up into this area here i'm taking some of the contracts off and i'm raising the stop loss up because i don't want it to come back down into that fair value gap again because what it done is once twice it should never come back down that again if it does i'm wrong and i don't want to be a part of that trade if i'm in a position that's still open or have a partial open from the original position after partials have been taken then i'm going to kill the trade and i'll move to the sidelines but the main thing i want you to understand about this is i'm not trading the model that i'm teaching on youtube and you're probably going to say well why don't you just trade the model michael why don't you just teach us how to use the model i am when the model speaks i'm going to show you but i'm also teaching you how you still learn to read price when the model isn't giving you a setup because every single market isn't going to give you that model's entry setup and framework every single day every single session and because i'm the author of these concepts i don't have a limitation to just that one so is it beneficial for you to have me say nothing when the model says nothing or is it beneficial for me to teach you how to read price action how to get in sync and learn how to change gears when the market shows you it's time to change gears i think that's a little bit better expectation on the part of a student with that of us a mentor that has the experience i'm trying to share with you so there's there's two camps that's going to be looking at this video and they're going to say he's not really good teacher because he's not focusing on the model when i'm telling you the model didn't do anything today in this index so what did i lean on my experience my ability and the concepts that are already taught in this youtube channel so one of the twitter followers mentioned today that uh can they use time frames outside of the one through five minute chart but use the same logic yes yes that's all i'm trying to do i'm trying to teach you a mindset that on the lowest time frame it gives you a lot of experience a lot of setups a lot of things to practice but don't limit yourself to that because there's so many other ways to trade using what i'm teaching you and you can scale it to whatever time frame and every whatever chart you want to use it on okay but you still have to understand what price is likely to do and where is it drawing to okay so let's talk a little bit about narrative when the market shifted here bullishly and it came back down into that 50 minute time frame fair value and then rallied this right here told me that they want to set this up for a bullish run in the afternoon why go back to that daily chart remember we were inside this shaded area here that's the fair value gap did i did not shade when we were looking at the daily chart naked at the beginning of the video if you shade that on your own chart you'll see when you drop down the lower time frame five minute chart yours will look like this so it dips down into that lower end of that ferrari gap and it rallies trades back down into the 15 minute time frame fair value got which is what that is here then it rallies now right away in my mind this tells me that the algorithm is priming itself for an afternoon run to potentially previous day's high which is this level up here okay so from here right when it crossed over here i'm thinking okay it could potentially be running previous days high i don't know yet then when it drops down into here and then rallies from that then i know it now that's narrative okay by itself it doesn't mean go in here and buy it because hey the narrative says it's going to probably run to previous days high because i could see myself stopped out if i'm premature i want to see something that makes sense logically so that means do we see displacement yeah we do is that an energetic price run oh yeah it is then that low to that high i want to get that measurement for premium to discount and what do i want to wait for a discount so i measured from that low to that high in that short little vignette video on my twitter feed and 50 and went below that and that's the fair value gap so it trades down into here creates a short term low and then drops into it here now what happens if it went here and rallied okay well i would have missed a move but i'm looking for sell side liquidity i want to see a stop run because what that's doing and how this fits into narrative is if i'm thinking that this move here to here and then retracing down is setting up an afternoon run to potentially this level here by the close of the day i want to be like smart money and do what buy sell stops that is buying sell side liquidity my order as it's underneath here i fill right here i'm buying it on this candle right there i think you probably don't believe me i'm going to show you the candlesticks in a minute but i drop down into it i go long there and then i wait for it to rally up so it starts to rally up it consolidates a little bit in here and then to almost come out above this high and it creates a little small little consolidation and then pumps it through the old high and the 4140 level creates a short-term high rallies once more i draw a line on here because i want to see if price can be supported by that down closed candle that's an order block it trades through it and once it did that i mixed the trade okay i have taken a lot of the trade off through here and i'm also in an environment still inside that daily range of multiple days on the daily chart where it might not go to previous days high today so this might be it and it might need to use wednesday's trading so that was my thought process for closing the trading and protecting my stop loss which never would have been hit because the stock was below here but it came down closed in this very very gap rallied again this is an optimal trade entry once more pushing it higher but still did not hit the previous day's high now think about this folks think at the beginning of the day i tweeted public knowledge i want to see initially if it wants to make a run down the 40-70 okay and as soon as i tweeted it it was like off the races it goes right in here boom and then boom and then drifted down to it here and it made a low of 40 76 even didn't break out below the fair value gap that's formed on the daily chart that's again that shaded area here and i'd have this tweet here so you can see that's the time at 10 35 that's when i said no yesterday's high so that is there on this candle and here 10 35 i'm tweeting note previous days high so i'm drawing your attention up here so if a retracement comes back down into what i shared in that video beforehand before it even came down here i'm showing you this and i gave you this level up here as previous days high in chart format in the video showing you that this is where my my mindset is i'm thinking think up here this is where it's going to draw to likely and it's going to retrace down to this level here so right away this should tell you that for the folks that are paying attention ict says that it's probably going to go up in the afternoon and it's probably going to gravitate towards this level up here which is previously high and he's showing this level here where he's taught optimal trade entry fair value gap when it goes down to here it's in what a discount so we're moving from a discount to buy liquidity so the premium array is up here the discount array is here doesn't it make sense for you to anticipate the move or originating basically from here running above here taking a partial and seeing if it can gravitate towards the high yes so you studied that way so that's what i do with my students in my private group that's what i'm doing with you okay folks listen i've had thousands of emails come to me in the last couple months asking to let you all in my private group my private group is done i don't even make videos for them anymore okay we just chit chat on a forum now that's all it is i'm teaching mentorship right here for free you don't have to have a paypal account you don't have to give me a credit card number you don't have to worry about missing your payment nothing all you have to do is show up every time i do this or show up over there on twitter see what i'm doing over there and i promise you if you stick with it the things i'm teaching you work they were i absolutely used this logic today i didn't create something new today this is exactly what i'm teaching you as a mentorship this is it i did the very thing i'm teaching you with so that way you can see uh put a button was pushed do i need to put a trade on every single day to teach you now will i continue to show trades yes will you be accepted into my private group no so please don't ask okay that community is closed to them and you are all benefiting and believe me they're learning along with you with this mentorship paid members that went through my private group they're learning things just like you are right here because i'm taking things and simplifying them if i let you all into that group and took all of your money you would all be confused okay because there's so many things it's very very detailed i have simplified it here that's all i've done i've made it very simple so that we can go in look at these things and make it applicable because you need to learn how to do this before it gets hard and it's going to get real hard folks read between the lines and think about what i'm saying look around the world's changing okay so put in the time don't rush it you don't need to worry about taking a year to learn how to do this i've streamlined this okay i'm here until the good lord takes me or takes away my mental faculties i'm on youtube okay i'm on twitter i love doing this i love being back in this capacity i'm free to do what i want to do i'm enjoying myself and all of you both private membership and public mentorship you're all benefiting from it and i'm having fun with you so don't mess it all up by stressing me out asking me to join a group that i'm not going to let you join anyway and i don't want your money so stop asking me so anyway uh this is where we're at right now i think we'll probably want to sweep up here maybe that might even happen tonight during the asian session but let's take a look at the executions and on this candle here the low on this candle look at this figure right here okay that low is 411 even and the low on this candle comes in at 4108 and a quarter and my fill 41 10 and a quarter below that low whoops i'm sorry i'm doing the wrong i'm doing the wrong one the low is 41 10 and a half and then my candle of entry was here the low was 41 0 8 and a quarter and my fill was still below that it's 41 10 and a quarter so one quarter point below that okay so there's the entry right there and then partial here another partial there so half the position cup up 10 contracts on this price and took out took off half in that area where that rectangle was drawn in that little vignette video okay again i'm doing this folks look back over here see this area over here and these relative equal highs i'm thinking that it could do this and maybe this might be a failure swing right and then go lower so i'm taking off half in the event that i'm possibly wrong so that's why i did that and you understand that and i took another partial off here i tweeted and paid the trader okay so three contracts there at 41 34 and a half and then i waited for it to pump up through this old high and the 4140 level at 41 41 and a half now actually i was like three seconds late i was waiting for it to give me a nice big candle and if you watch the vignette video i did i i sell the uh the one contract and then it gives that little bit of a ramped up expansion on the candle so i'm like ah i just would have waited one more you know one more moment it could have gave me a better feel but whatever and then here is me closing the remaining one contract because i was concerned it was going to take the stop and i didn't want it to stop out i'd rather take my price at my own exit and not let the stop out occur but it never would have hit it here and just rebalance that and then at the old high it round again but still fail to get to my objective on the day but this was the draw on liquidity now think about what i've shown here i was wrong on this level and i was wrong on the 40-70 level but i was able to trade and take the lions portion of the move in the middle that's all you need you don't need to be in here doing the absolute highest high and the lowest low you don't need to do that okay the folks are asking me can you teach me to do that you don't need to look at this wouldn't this keep you from going hungry i mean i think it would i mean this is good eating here i mean this is a nice move it makes sense and i don't need this level to get profitable hold high yes yes and yes okay so i mentioned i'll go into the smt diversions in here so let's do that now all right so i'm adding the little compare tab it's a little plus symbol up here if you go into your trading view click on it it'll give you the drop down menu for what instrument or market you want to compare it to and you use nqm2022 this is going to change to nqu 2022 and this symbol for s p will eventually in a few days change to esu 2022 and it will be basically tracking the september delivery contract of both indices right now we're in the month of june and it's about to roll over so what we do is we monitor chart i'm sorry bartchart.com and whenever the open interest is larger in the september contract than that of the june contract that's when i roll over so that's how i do it it's a little different from everybody else i'm sure but that's what it is i'm doing when i'm rolling over into the next month because these months or these contracts they expire okay so june won't be traded anymore in a couple days and september will and we'll trade september until a week or so into september and then we'll roll over to the december contract because september will expire all right so anyway uh with the compare tab you're putting in this symbol here as a selection in the drop down menu and once it's down here you click on a little gear and make sure it's highlighted low because what we're doing is we're comparing and contrasting the lows inside of a fair value gap after a retracement into a discount when we're expecting to potentially trade up in here i'm speaking like you knew this okay that's how you're supposed to talk to yourself in your journal this low versus this low you see that lower low is that seen here low high or low we're comparing lows so when we're bullish we're plotting this line down here as a compare and contrast tool and it's smt smart money tool or smart money technique i never really settled on what the t was going to be so that's why i always say it like that but it's my way of measuring real accumulation distribution so if we know that this area down here is a discount and we know this is an imbalance fair value gap it trades down into a pool of liquidity below that low as cell stops and i want to buy sell stops like i've mentioned here i'm buying the sell stops inside the fair value gap during a classic by day which is open at midnight trade down create the low of the day rally and then creates an optimal trade entry or fair value gap or you're going to buy the short term low during smt diversions okay so there's real accumulation here between the nasdaq and s p so this tells me that the nasdaq is failing to go lower so it's under accumulation and this is just a stop hunt below that short-term low see that now some of you are like you know this is really complicated ict you know i really like the optimal trade entry and these fair value gaps are all over the place how do i know which one is the one i want to use okay check this out a lot of you know how to use optimal trade entry you'll use the low here to the high pull your fib up 62 to 79 level if it goes down to that then you'll buy it okay that's one pattern but now watch what else there is this is turtle suit you have a low lower low by the low that's being violated with optimal trade entry see that or you can just do this low high find the fair value got below 50 level which is a discount as soon as it trades at the top level of it hit it there buy it there stop below the lower low or level here there's your there's your pattern see that or you can do this you can wait for it to trade down into this like that and then find the swing high prior to trading into the fair value gap and put a buy stop there as your entry and whatever the lowest low is after it hits that that's where your stop loss would be just right below that and you can be buying strength that's not in my opinion the preferred entry strategy but i'll just give you a bunch of them but it's using what bias that has been corrected and calibrated based on what the market has done here at key times okay so it at 9 30 the market does what it brings us that volatility we look for so it shifts higher after we have another smt diversions here but we have that shift higher it's showing us real accumulation in the s p it rallies i don't want to chase that i wait for it to come back down into a 50 minute time frame fair value gap which it does now am i still buying it there i could i absolutely could do that but i'm not willing to because i want to know that what i thought initially which was 40 70 it could still wipe out that low it's early on in the day so i'm gonna i'm going to wait for the market to really communicate to me that the algorithm is pricing in a narrative that the afternoon session is bullish that's it i'm going to give up the morning session folks see just because i'm sitting in front of charts doesn't mean i'm taking a trade because guess what that gum i'm gonna take a trade because i've been here all day and i deserve one it doesn't work like that you have to wait and be patient there's more time waiting in between the setups than actually doing anything and then it's funny you have to have incredible patience in both stages you have to be very patient waiting for the setup and then once you get in the trade you have to be patient and let the trade pan out once it comes in the 50 minute time frame here then it rallies like this then then i'm comfortable knowing what i'm looking for what is that dealing range low dealing range high fib across it fifty percent below that here's a fair value got trade down into it i wanna buy sell stops that's just me i wanna do it because it really fortifies the setup it allows me to get in where the smart money will be buying that little movement here i'm buying that very candle i didn't buy the next candle i didn't buy the candle before that i bought below that price 41 10 and a half i bought it at 41 10 and a quarter the things i'm teaching you i'm pushing a button it's a really real instance of happening not something i took a trade and you never see that happening okay i'm showing you example after example after example of the things i'm teaching you and i'm using the logic i'm not creating some falsehood i'm not scamming you i'm not frauding you i'm not doing anything except for teaching you what works what makes these markets book and they do it every single week the same kind of stuff all the time smt diversions here you see that smt divergence here lower low higher low here we have the lower low in nasdaq higher low in s p that sets the stage for that run higher okay i could literally go on and on for about four more hours just in this chart but i promised myself i wouldn't make these videos very long and i know some of you really want those long ones back but i look at the statistics on my videos and the attention spans about 10 minutes each video so i'm gonna try my best to stay in that vicinity can't promise but i'm certainly going to do it as much as i can and i'm certainly obviously well beyond that that limitation here but i know a lot of you press that uh two times the speed uh function on the videos and i get it if you ever listen to me in a forced uh live session i sound like a different guy don't i that's because i don't have that sped up chipmunk sound that you guys usually put me on but that's cool i understand everybody's time is important but hopefully you found something in this insightful hopefully you're encouraged by me actually showing it working and not just talking about something theoretically and again be safe and i'll touch base with you again on twitter tomorrow i'm sure and again on thursday in another lecture in the mentorship

all right folks welcome back all right so we're looking at the s p futures contract for june 2022 on the left-hand side you can see that we have a daily chart and on the right-hand side it's a one-hour chart so i'm only going to do this to like save time also bring your attention to levels that are sensitive on one time frame higher time frame and how it's subordinate on the lower time frame to those higher time frame levels if you don't know what i'm referring to obviously you'll understand more as we go through all right so this morning i had a short little video that i posted about how we had recently been in this trading range in here and if we were to start to move higher and had displacement to the upside this could have been a draw on liquidity this is the objective i was looking for near term if we were to break higher we had news this morning and unemployment data which obviously you know given the state of affairs at present it's a heavy weight around the neck of the markets so we had a move lower prior to the opening at 9 30. i talked about how until we had some kind of displacement i wasn't really excited about doing much in the marketplace i felt that 40 70 was a nice draw on liquidity which would be below these routes to equal those i posted that obviously before 9 30 a.m so it gave you a a target okay or my bias so i'm thinking what if i'm pointing down here before 9 30 am i suggesting that we're going to go up here or here or here no so i'm looking for evidence to support the idea that i run below these relative equal lows is warranted i also stated if we went below those lows that we would draw into that fair value cut now with the benefit of hindsight obviously i'm talking to folks that have not been with me or they watched only post production or post market reviews or things like that it sounds like hindsight but i assure you the folks over there on twitter and it's time and date stamped i don't delete any tweet and if it's a typo it stays okay and in my age and my eyes failing like they are it's probably going to be a reoccurring theme over there that i type something correctly but i'm not sweeping anything under the rug i'm not trying to hide anything from you i came out in video explained that i would be more interested in seeing this level down in here and if we did we would draw into this area here now that is suggesting several things number one we're expecting the volatility or i'm expecting the volatility to be significant enough to take us below these lows and if that was to occur then we're going to draw all the way down into here which means what we're going to have a small range day on the daily chart or a large range day clearly a large range day so there was a lot of things that i laid in your hands this morning that hopefully give you hope that these things are predictable obviously i'm not without imperfections uh yesterday i mapped out an idea on twitter and engaged and i took a loss it was a five point loss it was not a significant loss and in fact i called a level later in the afternoon how i could have easily gained that back now when i say those things understand the premise okay why why am i saying that am i saying it to beat my chest and sound egotistical no i wanted everyone to see what it's like even if i do something wrong and i don't rush out there to try to fix it okay because that's going to be your initial response to you taking a losing trade in your demo account or worst case scenario rush into trading live funds when none of you are ready to do that yet now i understand there's traders in here that are watching the videos and you're probably profitable when i say that you shouldn't be trading with live funds you shouldn't be treating with life funds with these concepts because you're still learning them which i'll end this video with a request from all of you so you guys can let me know in the comment section what you would like to see going forward i have a suggestion and you guys are open to give me input on that and you as a community will let me know what it is that we're going to be doing all right so on the daily chart to the left you can see we have those relative equal lows i mentioned the draw on liquidity was there so i was focusing what sell side or i had a bearish spice i gave conditions that we went below there it's not going to go down there to go up it's going to go down into this area here so with those levels transposed over to the hourly chart now this level here is this level on the daily chart this level down here is this level now obviously some of you're like that's pretty obvious but you'd be surprised how many new students i have and they get lost in the time frames so whatever you're doing on your higher time frame you want to start your annotations there but keep them simple you want to see a level that it's going to draw to and or what key levels that may be a factor for changing or suggesting a bias is in play as i did this morning i said i believe we're going to go down below here i thought that's likely to occur and if that does happen we're drawing into this area here not just going below relative equal lows to go higher because there's a lot of people all around the world that are being exposed to my content whether it be directly from me or someone that's learned my concepts and have tried to create something new with a you know twist of their own they're teaching that it's always a relative equal low or equal lows to hit those and then go the other way that's not the case narrative must be understood and narrative unfortunately requires experience and experience is what i'm lending you so when i'm talking to you or if i'm pointing to something i'm lending my three decades of experience doing it so that way you can hopefully grow faster but i'm not trying to rush you along but it's easier for a student to be engaged when they're shown something to anticipate something and then they have the benefit and enjoyment of watching it pan out in their own charts which i think that's the epiphany to every student under me and i guess anyone else when they have that moment of astonishment where it delivers as they're expecting or hoping to see happen it feels like they're in alignment with the marketplace which is many times not the case for retail traders and new traders or long-term you know struggling traders that or break-even is can't find their footing and can't be profitable it's a wonderful feeling and i know once you have that moment you'll want to dig deeper and that inspires me as a mentor too so if you watched this pan out today and you expected it based on being in the community and audience members this morning before the market opened up with my commentary uh give me a heads up in the comment section and what was it like to watch it unfold so over here on the hourly chart we had a fair value gap here swing low we had displacement we consolidated going into midnight last night new york time it rallied up traded into a fair value gap here and up into the bearish order block so we have this order block it touches it you can take that trade but i'm trying to draw your attention to these areas here okay where there's three candles one candle in the middle that has an exposed area that is not overlapped with the previous candles low immediate candle to the right of it so there's that little section that we call a fair there you go price goes above it hits the order block but look at the candles see how the candles bodies stay predominantly in between these two levels here so yeah there's a wick and there's a wick but largely the volume is encapsulated in between these two levels i drew your attention here i mentioned how we would like to go below those lows and then we have an old low back here so even if we weren't looking at my commentary or watching it this framework here then running to that low is something that you should have identified but if you didn't it's okay you'll get it in time this price or level here is the opening price at midnight new york local time so i'm extending that out in time so now think about what i've done so far here before the fact in twitter in a video and in a post i stated that i'm interested in seeing these taken out and i like 470 as an interest okay that's a draw in liquidity so for up here and i'm stating that i think 40 70 is interesting your eye should go to that level and study what is at that level that may be of interest to me so that way it forces you to dig into the chart now in the beginning working with me as your mentor this is going to be very frustrating for some of you because unfortunately some of you just want it spelled out for you and i don't teach that way you're not going to learn that way and i'm going to spoon feed you and you're going to learn better and more productively by you going in doing the very things that you would be doing if you didn't need me holding your hand which means going into the charts looking for the evidence and details you know yourself so you had a bearish bias given to you you had an objective a draw on liquidity and in the chart here i'm showing you the framework for the daily range the opening price at midnight i teach they're typically if there's going to be a down day which is what i was suggesting before the market opens at 9 30 we would see a bearish day and look for a draw to 470. if that occurs your attention should be down between these two levels here based on that daily chart okay now incorporate power three my power three concept is the accumulation of shorts the manipulation of those individuals that were already short that's what this is here that's a judas swing the market goes up to a short-term premium which is high to low back into a premium relative to this dealing range high and that dealing range low then the market breaks lower trades below the short term relative equal lows here retraces consolidates a little bit breaks once more consolidates and then attacks the cell side here and aggressively runs through the 470 which is what we were anticipating based on my commentary before the market opened and then we take our attention down to here so if you are short you take a partial here then you wait for the daily range to fulfill that means you have to submit yourself to time what time three o'clock to four o'clock wait to that last hour of trading because you'll get the delivery of price when it trades down into that all right now we have the 15 minute time frame on the left-hand side and the five-minute chart on the right you can see how we rallied up into that fairway gap on the hourly we broke down once more traded back above the opening price at midnight here breaks lower consolidates all of this we'll talk about later in the video then breaks once more trades up into a fear of a gap here breaks lower and aggressively runs into that higher time frame daily fair value got on the five minute chart you can see here we have the equities opening at 9 30 a.m here and i mentioned when we were down here i said price is initially showing weakness it's going lower traders are going to get caught short doing that chasing price going lower they're gonna reprice the 4105 there's buy side liquidity resting there and a fair value gap the market immediately after my post runs to that level i engaged that with a demo trade i entered it and i took profits below that short term low here and then i'll teach you how i knew this was reversing on me and saved my stop and also took a second partial off it routed once more blowing out that short-term high so we have a lot of chop in the initial opening range low higher high than that high lower low than that low lower low again then rally through this high and left this fair value got consolidated a little bit in here trade it back down in once more back into the opening price at midnight which is this line here if you're bearish you want to be going short at or above that level or as close as you can get to it like this one here okay the market drops down between 11 o'clock and noon it consolidates then retraces back up takes by side here breaks lower returns back to a swing low which we'll talk about in a moment breaks lower again aggressively runs for that 470 level and it's off to the races down into the daily fair bay you got now if you look at the daily range through the scope of a five-minute chart here you can see the opening price here at midnight prices gravitates around that and in london they rally and start building in a premium ahead of the 8 30 time window the market creates the high breaks takes out short-term cell side liquidity here retraces back up into consolidates for the majority of the afternoon then it breaks lower and then aggressively attacks the cell side below 470 and then going right back down to that 440 level and then hanging out and consolidating and closing inside that larger daily fair value got now i want you to take a look at this price action here we're looking at the afternoon so with the morning aside because i walked everyone through that basically on twitter and with pre-market analysis and commentary the rules for a afternoon session trade before you even consider trading in the afternoon session you have to consider what is the daily range trying to do is it trying to expand higher is it trying to expand lower did it reverse in the morning session and is it going to have a counter trend move or is it going to just consolidate because it's waiting on a big news event the following day today we had a big news event we had employment data the market consolidated and we had a bearish bias we were looking for 40 70 based on my experience i was generous enough to give that to you beforehand with commentary suggesting it would trade down to that lower time frame fair value gap on the ema s p's daily chart so the framework was one-sided it was not ambiguous it was specific about what we were looking for once the market started to break after lunch when does lunch end at one o'clock in the afternoon new york local time that is here so 12 to 1 there is our new york lunch if we're bearish what did i teach you the market will do what it will clear the stops during the lunch hour what highs were formed in the lunch hour here and prior to it going in this was the bicep liquidity pool or short-term high so at one o'clock the algorithm reprices and runs to take the stops above the buy side here so during the lunch hour we're seeing that they took the stops here you can if you're aggressive you can put on a trade here because we're in a directional move we're trying to anticipate a large range day in large range days can typically form with a busy lunch schedule and i just recently taught this that the market if it's going to be a fast market during the lunch hour it can create a significant higher significant low but the premise mainly is if you're bearish you're going to be looking for the highs to be swept because they don't want participants to be profitable that may have assumed a short position from the morning session or prior to this high forming they may have already been short here and instead of letting the market release and break to lower pd arrays in a discount market the algorithm reprices knocks those individuals out because it floods the market with what buyers at a higher price higher than what than it was here than it was here so smart money utilizes this run above the short-term high as an influx of buying interest and liquidity that's available immediately while the market's being priced here and held at that level smart money will go in and sell to those buyers that their orders will be resting about here so their stops are being tripped their short position is being knocked out and conversely there's traders that would see that high being broken as a means of getting long and they have a buy stop that would trigger them getting in on a breakout so smart money is cannibalizing those two types of orders what orders are they buy side liquidity so the counterparty to their short has to have buying interest that buying interest is being engineered by the algorithm and it runs up here so smart money goes short here with the expectation that they can take off a portion here back to an old low of 470 and then 440 and then into that fair value gap on the daily chart now sticking to the rules of the model i'm trying to teach you if you do not trade during the lunch hour that's fine you're going to wait until after lunch before i set up the form those of you that have been studying my channel here on youtube you understand that this swing low here to a higher high than that of here is a breaker okay that's my ict bearish breaker what is a breaker a breaker is a pattern where price runs out a pool of liquidity in this case is a buy side liquidity pool and then it reverses and trades back down below that short-term low if it trades back up to that and the narrative is bearish notice that it's not just simply we have this pattern here and that's all it is no you must know what the market's likely to be reaching for if you leave that out it's not a breaker it's a gamble it's a guess it's a speculation that's aimless notice the difference there so this down closed candle the lowest one prior to move up clearing that short-term high and i teach this on the youtube channel so if you've already gone through the 2022 mentorship videos and you're caught up you're welcome to go through the other videos as well but i'm trying to keep your focus in this series because it's very easy for you to go into other series on this youtube channel and get inundated with things and create so many questions that will feel like they are pertinent to this model and they're not okay but i'm just giving you a comprehensive view of what it is i look at in price what i'm judging whether or not is it likely to continue going lower and as price starts to move back up in this level i would expect and anticipate that level repelling price and go lower and then be aggressive about trading below that because there's sell side there and then not going below this low here to go higher we want to see it go through there and accelerate going down it wants to run quickly for that 40 70 level because there's larger pool liquidity below that and then aggressively run into that fair value gap on the daily chart because that's the imbalance that the algorithm is going to want to reprice too in the afternoon obviously you can see post breaker being traded too heaviness falls below 40 70 and then accelerates see that see how fast it accelerates down small little consolidation no retracement no return back to an old low broken support becomes resistance forget about it this is an algorithmic cell day retail doesn't get to do a lot of those retail concepts you either are on board beforehand or you watch the ship sail off without you okay and that's basically what you end up seeing here in the price of 440 it gets traded through and back into that daily fair value gap as i mentioned would be the likely target for today all right so this brings me to the point of the video i promised everyone on twitter that i would touch on and i did a little bit of a rant on saturday i took my car out for a spin and you all got to see what it's like to be around ict where i don't have the benefit of having the camtasia studio editing out because there's a lot of times while i'm making these videos that things in the house will go on my kids will interrupt me my dogs will come in and bust in the door and you want me to play with them or i'll say something wrong and get upset about doing something incorrectly while i'm producing the video so they're like uh you know human traits you know i'm i'm a human being i make choices sometimes that aren't the best ones and sometimes you know i'm prone to have chemical imbalances because i'm bipolar and i don't make any excuses for that i don't make any uh attempt to hide it because i know if you spend time with me long enough you'll notice it so during the rant i gave on the twitter spaces i guess it's like a podcast feature to try to build up on that platform i tested it out this weekend and i mentioned that i would share with you all the model i'm teaching my son caleb i'm not afraid to teach it to you i'm not trying to hide it from you okay but i wanted to make sure he had some foundation to what it is he's trying to do and i wanted to spend time with him and figure out like because of his characteristics you know what's his concerns what's his fears what's his comfort level is he trying to you know trade the whole daily range or if you're trying to get in and out real quick small little pieces that type of personality you know inquiry that you have to do as a trader too you don't take a model because you see somebody else doing well with it and say i'm going to do that because if it doesn't match your personality if it doesn't match the way you see and engage price action you'll never make it work for you okay so i'm aware of that i'm cognizant of that effect on individuals learning things not just this but anything but with something so technical as this in this industry with as many as we have in terms of variables for choices what to do you know think about all the indicators that are out there think about all the the trading styles and methodologies and teachers and their respective personalities so you have to be able to number one be able to put up with them and listen to them to learn from them and sometimes i'm off-putting like i can't retain the attention of everyone and or they don't like my teaching style or they don't have any faith in me or whatever i'm not gonna scratch the itch for everyone but for those that sit down here and they want to learn from me obviously you've seen live accounts being utilized this year my son started trading in the first week of may of this year he started trading a live account and he opened up with amp futures and i'm not repping them i'm not saying anything for you to go and open up an account with them but i have been asked are they a good broker i can only report the fact that he has not reported any issues with his fills being executed and done professionally the only issue there was was they weren't happy with the fact that i was sharing one of his statements that he emailed me and they asked him to ask me and me to take it down so i took it down but i can talk about the numbers okay so here's what he did he had a equity low of 2810 and in a matter of a number of weeks until just at present he didn't do any trades today okay we were observing i was teaching i did trades myself but he was observing he's in this the position of spectating not speculating today because i wanted him to understand that the the large range day can creep in like it did in the afternoon and it may not look so clear in the morning but we were looking at it with that lens and i was showing that beforehand in the marketplace and in the commentary on twitter but he's at 18 300 plus so in the course of like four weeks you know that's about 400 return so that's in my opinion you know that's a remarkable growth that that shows obviously he knows what he's looking for he knows what he wants to do he wants to obviously grow his account he wants to build it up and not try to hit grand slam home runs and because he works at a low paying job it's real easy to hit that threshold that he earns on a weekly basis so when i sat down with him one of the things i felt was imperative was he has a very short attention span he's easily distracted so i wanted to give him a model that gave him a very low threshold for a return of points or pips and since we settled in on the index futures market for him it ignores the spread issues that are going to be a plague for traders that are using forex it's a professional market it's a very liquid market the e-mini s p and its systematic in the way it delivers price so if i can sit down with him i want to take him to the chart at a specific time of day with a specific logic in mind and then have him hopefully see a pattern that repeats it may not form that day he sits down then he has to just move to the sidelines and do nothing that choice to say i don't see it today and then if something forms after the charts get closed or if the trader moves away from the charts and they come back later on and they see it moved a certain way that fear of missing out you need to squash that quickly in the beginning and the only way you do that is by back testing and seeing how many times these things form so while we did that together because i'm his father and i'm literally next to him like i'm next to him giving him my experiences as close as i can possibly be next to doing it you know what i mean like i'm sitting here acting like the internal voice for him i'm saying okay what do you see here what do you see there what happens if you did this and what happens if you did that where would you think price is going to go so i'm literally being the internal dialogue that 30 years of experience would have spoke to him internally so he has that inside advantage okay that that that home field advantage if you will he's pushing the buttons obviously and if he elects to do nothing based on what i'm asking about in the chart sometimes the market moves he's not in it sometimes he does something and the market does something against him and he has that decision of do i let the stop loss get hit or do i just bail now and figure out what it is that i did wrong or what i'm uncomfortable about so it may not be the ideal learning conditions for everyone but i know where i'm leading him i need him to be prepared to obviously look for a specific element in price action and it's algorithmic okay i'm not sitting down with him with anything retail i'm not filling his head up with you know bull flags and bigger flags and when they fail because i teach my you know price action students to look for those types of things i'm not teaching him trend lines i'm not even bringing any of that stuff in i'm taking him right to the brass tacks of what it is that the algorithm is going to do because i only want him to be a one-trick pony right now that's all he needs to be able to feel confident to leave his job so i said i would teach it i said i would show it to you so i'm going to kind of give you the loose framework you know what it is that i try to teach him what he's looking for those types of elements but before i get into it i want to remind the viewers because this might be the first video you came across with my content so i want all of you and to be reminding those of you that have lost this in the conversation throughout these videos that price is delivered by an algorithm okay there is no buying and selling pressure that is something that they use as a excuse for what the market does and or doesn't do and algorithmic theory is based on time and price now time and price when i wrote this algorithm coding it leans heavily on the time element okay what what does that mean what time of day what day of week what week of month what month of year what seasonal influences so there's several factors i'm encoded in the algorithm that will seek these reoccurring phenomenon that can be capitalized on by those individuals that know what it is that they're hunting okay that little billboard that flashes uh hey it's time for you to engage now okay that signal that pattern that set up that framework whatever you want to call it the moment right before you push a button that's what i'm trying to take his attention into okay i'm taking all the other distractions away and i want him to go right in and look at that specific element price levels are useless until time is considered just because it's trading at your favorite price level this is the reason why support resistance is a fallacy there's many instances that anyone can go back in hindsight and say here is where this line worked and it repelled price up or down do it live consistently pick the right level consistently and that's the problem that retail traders have i went through that same thing i couldn't pick the right support resistance level even the higher time frame ones because sometimes you'll have a move where it'll go up hit a level that would be otherwise viewed as resistance and then it starts to go down and then it goes one more time up higher higher and then higher high takes my stop and then i'm afraid to go back in and go short right you've all experienced that i did the same stuff in the 90s 1992 1993 1994 all those types of fearful events of getting stopped out and then abandoning my opinion about what i thought the market was going to do and instead of saying okay the framework's still valid i just had the entry wrong let me go back in with less risk this time less leverage this time and see if it pans out but like most of you and everybody else those stop out events create fear and anxiety and uncertainty so that's why time has to be considered first because the algorithm is going to start working a specific macro that means a short order of things that it will do as instructions it's going to seek a specific level move to a premium move to a discount suddenly move or consolidate and wait for another time element in that same trading day or trading week or month okay so that's the reason why i i'm teaching you that that element of time is crucial your inability to know everything that there is to know about time is going to be the area where it which you will have the largest growth in but you'll have the initial adversities when when when when when to do this when to do that when going through the motions of what it is i'm teaching you it'll happen for you that you understand why certain things are occurring at a specific time and i can't articulate it any better than that it's just a matter of doing it sitting with me every week looking at what is i'm trying to share taking your attention to a specific price level over time your your eyesight your understanding the visibility the perception of price will be dialed in you'll know what it is i'm doing because you've done it with me for days weeks and months okay time is of no use unless price is at a key pd array okay just because it's time for you to be able to sit in front of the charts it doesn't mean anything unless it's at a tpd array so in other words blending the two yields astonishing results and the precision that i share with you i've done a plethora of examples proving precision proving prognostication forecasting objectives targets the whole business okay it's not my aim or goal to try to do magic tricks for you okay i i don't want to be out here trying to be david copperfield of the markets and say here watch this sleight of hand and are you amazed by that are you amazed my task is i'm making you a wizard okay i'm teaching you the craft i'm not up here performing for you i try to make it as engaging as i can to keep the attention span on those that are very limited and bored easily i try to you know get their attention quick with little things that will draw their attention and hopefully keep them engaged long enough for the effects of learning properly to take root so if you look at this price action that's been staring at you does anything stand out on this chart if you're a new student to price action or if you're a new student to me a lot of these things that you're looking at here in terms of the price action all the movements and such it looks like a foreign language you've never learned how to read well if you're looking at price action like this it looks like it has no reason for doing what it's doing it's completely random and one of the fun things i get the experience as a mentor with the insight that i have being in a position where i have done a lot of the producing of these things and the authorship of it i get the benefit and pleasure of watching people get blown away by the incredible detail that this algorithm repeats and follows if we take all of the noise away from just all this back and forth movement and we add just a little bit of lipstick suddenly we have a lot more to work with what's the first element to algorithmic theory price or time time so time begins in the morning session for us as a index futures trader at 8 30. that's when the news embargo lifts that means at 8 30 that's when there's usually a news event or some kind of economic report that comes out at 8 30 new york local time so that's the reason why i tell you to set your clocks on your trading view platform here to the local time in new york this candle right here is the 8 30 candle in new york time this morning i outlined how i felt that we would likely see the market move to a liquidity pool a specific liquidity pool and it would draw down and attack the sell side i teach my son to look for setups that are going to target a specific pool of liquidity it means i have to have a clear idea where the market's likely to go up for buy side or down for sell side i'm not trading a support and resistance idea i'm not looking to go to a level to watch it repel away that's not what i'm doing that's a fallacy that's the reason why retail traders drop the ball so many times and or blow their accounts and never find consistency because they're trying to force something that is designed to fail i don't know why it's so hard for people to acknowledge when they are met with extreme adversities trying to force retail logic to work can you make money with retail concepts yes yes you can if you understand how to reprice like i'm teaching it if you did those types of things without understanding why the market should do what it's doing why is price booking the way it is what does that mean why is price going to these specific levels at the time it's doing it there's a logic behind that and for some that want to say there is no technical science you know at some point you know when does it stop becoming useful all of it's useful every tiny minute little fluctuation in these price movements are absolutely controlled engineered and premeditated either by ai artificial intelligence that's the algorithm it's following the code that's been written for it or there are times when manual intervention comes in and they will send price to a specific price level sometimes it's going to be abrupt and aggressive and it may not be fun or pleasurable being a part of that move other times it will be exhilarating because you were on the right side when those moments of intervention occur that's a manual intervention that means someone is literally going in and manipulating price to do a specific thing what would that be like fomc a rate announcement something to that effect and the market will reprice aggressively quickly to a price that's well outside the scope that would be reasonably expected for that short term perspective big explosive price movement the economic calendar is useful in that respect because you can go in and see where these events are likely to form so i'm looking for days in my son's model where he can go in and engage price when there is a medium or high impact news event or if there is a lack of one he can practice but he shouldn't be engaging with his normal risk percentage okay so the first element is time so at 8 30 in the morning that's when a news embargo lists that's the first element of time that i taught you with this model the second one is 9 30. okay that's right here the first here at midnight new york local time that opening price is here did the market rally above that opening price at 8 30 yes are we bearish i proved this morning i was expecting lower prices i preferred lower prices so that means we're above the opening price at midnight so my power 3 concept is you want to be shorting at or above the opening price at midnight in new york local time if you're trying to capture movement on the daily range on a down day so that opening price look what happens we run up take out short-term highs here that's a short-term run on liquidity who's going to have stops at that one minute anybody that would have put a stop loss in on these lower time frames there's traders that are doing that all the time the algorithm is not aware of how much volume rests above or below a high or low that's penetrated it has no understanding of that it doesn't need it for folks that are perplexed by that statement and i've said it several times in the past ever play a video game how about pac-man i'm a child of the 70s i was born 1972 august 8th 7 11 p.m see that 7 11. lucky 7-eleven i came in the world with some luck didn't i so when you're looking at a game like pac-man okay what keeps pac-man inside the boundaries of those lines that make up the maze that it runs around and collects and eats those dots until it gets to a power dot or chased down and killed by the ghosts the program language keeps him limited the play board or game maze has limitations those limitations are programmed as such every video game today they have a map okay fortnite call of duty battlefield all that genre of video game creation all those maps or territories that the player gets to enjoy and explore they have limitations okay the daily range has those limitations programmed into it as well until manual intervention is brought in and those initial boundaries are removed okay so think of price like that so if you know that we're likely to see that in terms of like an analogy we're at at 8 30 we're above the opening price at midnight we ran a short term high here the algorithm doesn't care how many orders we're above that it doesn't care it just has to take out a short term high it does so it's at a premium it took out buy side so what is it likely to do now because we're in a bearish day and we're above the opening price and it's at 8 30. reprice for what sell side where sell side this level down here 4101 or what 4100 big figure 4100 level so there's liquidity resting below that what kind of liquidity if markets price is here and sell side is here it's old lows there's sell side below that so market price is here relative equal lows in the past is this level here go back in the beginning the video okay you don't understand what that level is then that liquidity is sell side we're at a premium here this would be a discount because market price is here or here anything below is what discount so the algorithm goes from buy side liquidity at 8 30 on a bearish day above the opening price wait for the market to trade lower it does short term low see that swing low trades through it creates a fair value gap rally back up to it sell short with the expectation is going to run to sell liquidity this is what i'm teaching my son to do at 8 30. that's all he's trying to capture there in this move he may not run all the way to the sell side he's going to get his five points once he does he's stopping he gets out and then he watches the move go to the sell side of cody pool why am i telling him to get out five points number one five points is very very easy i think that that is the lowest threshold of points a setup should hopefully yield if you're trying to do anything less than that you're doing ultra short-term scalping and the commission costs will kill you it ain't worth doing and i think five points is an easy threshold you can do it once in the morning you can do it once in afternoon even on a really weird choppy day you could reasonably pull out five points if you have the experience you don't have that experience yet so let me put that in your mind right now because i don't want you thinking well i'm going to go out there tomorrow and do what i see you said i've only been trading for a week so i think he's really convinced me and i can pull this off and it's going to be ten points a day for me five in the morning five in the afternoon this is gonna be cakewalk i'm not sure this put in my two weeks into this now until the boss pound sand no no no no don't do that you're not ready but if that's a goal for you start working towards it so over time my expectation is that my son will have a better understanding what he's doing and those five points he'll have hopefully learn to take a portion off at five points and then hold for that liquidity pool to be hit and because of doing that very thing he's rewarding himself initially while he's learning so he engages him it shows that he can make more money doing this than his job okay that does not mean that you can do more than your job i'm saying this is my son he has me as his father i'm sitting with him i'm coaching him i'm telling him what he should be focusing on i'm questioning why he isn't focusing on other things so i'm actually like co-piloting him you know i'm giving him you know visual and audible clues as to what he should be using to navigate price so don't think for a moment folks that he sat down you know and did like a couple days of talks with daddy and now he's out there making 400 gains from ezekiel up to where it is now that that is not what took place okay he has the benefit of me sitting with him talking to him okay much in the same vein that i did with you all this morning on twitter where i said this is what i'm looking at these are the levels i'm looking for if this breaks i think we're going down to that level i'm doing that on a minute-by-minute basis with caleb so he's literally driving a car with me talking about every pothole every potential hazard that's coming i'm reading the mind of all the drivers around us and telling him what they're going to do before they do it so it's it's it's a totally immersive experience for him and admittedly it's a little intimidating for him it's too much at some times and we have to repeat certain things or he gets confused or he's apprehensive or reluctant to do something or he second guesses something so you know all those types of things that any human being would have you know with dad's expectation to learn how to do this and also you're dealing with real money so i'm teaching him to respect what to do and when it's wrong he feels it it's not a matter of well you know i can reset a demo account no this is real money so when he sees the money going up in his account he feels that good feeling if he has entered a trade and it's drawing down on him he's feeling that now i know what i'm looking at i know what i'm expecting he doesn't so i'm allowing him to experience those things but five points i think is a reasonable low threshold over time he will by default learn to trade with more than five points but i gotta give him something to hit that it's easy that low-hanging fruit approach that's how i teach just like i taught on baby pips when i first came out 25 pips a week you should be aiming for that and when you get it stop does that mean when you're trading 10 years from now that's all you're gonna do no people that have been highly critical of me they like to take the things i say out of context and make a straw man argument about it and they have no idea what i'm doing with the new student i'm targeting a audience that is trying to do something that's going to give them encouragement feel like they're they're progressing and don't think for a moment that five points just once a day isn't good because you could literally do very very well think about it this way if you just did five points in the email asap one contract and never engaged money management to the degree where you start parlaying it up and start doing two contracts and then two contracts becomes four contracts eventually and then eventually you treat me if you just did one contract okay so calm down for a second and just listen to me for a moment if you just did one contract of the mini s p that means one point in your favor or against you is worth fifty dollars now fifty dollars times five that's 250 dollars a day if you did that consistently once every single day that's 25 handles or points a week that's 1250 a week i'm quite certain after polling my audience on twitter which isn't my entire audience obviously i have a lot of people there's a lot of people that actually leave comments on my video on youtube that i can see that they're a subscriber and i can also see the comments that are left by subscribers usually i answer the questions that people present to me if they're a subscriber because it's kind of like a little perk because i i have like a goal i want a million subscribers i'm going to lie to you i want to have a million subscribers on this channel and i'm surprised and really honored and humbled that so many of you subscribed to this channel and i mean 260 some viewers i thought by the end of the year i could have had 250 000 but now you know i'm almost you know on my way to 300 000 before i know it you know this this channel could be in a year or two at my goal of a million subscribers but folks that follow me and they leave comments if it's a comment that i want to address i usually will respond to those that have that little mark next to their name you can't really see it but i can because it's the channel i'm the owner of the channel so i can see who's commenting with a follow and if you follow me i appreciate that i thank you for that but i don't want any of you to think that you're going to make five points every single day for instance i took a loss of five points yesterday i could have easily went back in and made four times that later in the afternoon but that's just me you don't have that skill set in confidence yet that okay if you take a loss and you took five points as a draw down you're going to want to go back in and do it right away whereas i can and i chose not to because i want you to feel like okay it's okay and i even proved that i can call a move even in the afternoon i said this is where it's going to go i'm pointing to a specific level and went to it i said that we would run out the lows and we would break a trend line that retail thinks is you know noteworthy and they destroyed it go back and look at the comments on twitter i don't delete a single tweet zero so i'm laying breadcrumbs down for you but i'm not going to spoon feed you you're going to earn it here and that makes some of you angry it frustrates some of you and no amount of frustrated replies to me or you know pointed statements are gonna is gonna make me change the way i do it because once you earn this skill set you will not regret what you went through to get it and you will treasure it you'll appreciate it it's not like reading a book that teaches you a magic trick and then you want to go around telling everybody how to do the magic trick versus getting good at doing the magic trick there's a difference there okay so what i teach my son to do is at 8 30 he looks for a setup like this if it's if it's a bear scenario he's looking for liquidity below the marketplace and he's looking for some type of framework where it gives a fair value gap that is his pattern that's what he settled in on and we're gonna run to liquidity and if it gives him five points he's out even if the framework allows for 30 points he's getting out at five now i already know some of you hot shots has been doing it for a while or like to be critical or troll me and you just run your mouth oh this guy he's telling his son it could move 30 points but he's getting out at five points who does that someone that's never traded live money before that's who's doing it okay someone that's already made 400 some percent in one month that's who's doing it okay someone that hasn't had a losing day in weeks that's who's doing it so sit down take notes or move along in the afternoon there's a setup as well we'll get into that in a moment but the next area of opportunity is the 9 30 hour okay so equity is open at 9 30 and this is one i outlined the market was down here i mentioned on twitter i said okay they opened it up at 9 30 initially started sending it lower and we'll talk about that in a couple minutes of what that was and what information could be gleaned from that but i said that they're going to take price up into the fair value gap and also clear 4105. it's all time and date stamped folks you can go back on twitter take a look at it it's there it's undeniable it's not ambiguous it's very specific look at the time on your chart it's here i'm saying it 4105 that's where the buy side liquidity is that's where the stops are and it's a fair value gap there it's going to reprice there and then you're gonna see the move the real move for the day market drops from there i went short on a demo account and as price went below this low i tweeted first go back and look at the little recording okay i'm not in here because there's people already going around in other forums and other social media saying i'm trying to pump and dump because they don't have a big audience they think i'm going to go out there and say something hopefully create some kind of movement in the marketplace and then i'm going to get out before i say i'm getting out no i literally record myself saying pay the trader and then i go in and i take my partial as it goes below here go and watch the video so i'm not doing any of those types of things folks okay i'm going to be your best friend i'm gonna be the best friend you could ever have in these markets if you just simply relax and trust me i'm here to help you i'm not here to ask anything of you except for subscribe you know that's like a trophy for me if i get a million subscribers i want to have that i'll put the work in to earn it but i'm not asking you to pay for anything i'm not asking you to worship me and cheer my name and all that stuff none of that i just want you to have fun to hang out with me that's it because i promise if you do if you put the work into this stuff and hang out every single day show up every single day even if you don't understand it if you feel like you got confused about what it is i'm doing keep showing up every single day that discipline will yield results each one of you gonna have a different timeline is when you're gonna get it i don't have a deadline i don't have a i'm stopping when it gets this date i'm here now okay i'm enjoying myself i'm having fun and hopefully you guys are having fun too but this setup here eventually came back and ran back above the short-term high and ran here so we went one more time where above the new york midnight opening price so we're at a premium and above the opening price at midnight and consolidates in here and then it breaks down and later on in the afternoon we'll see what it does now if you watch the video you can see that i actually entered in here went short i was aiming for this i had a objective of taking two contracts off here so it went below that i tweeted take partials or pay the trader first then i went into my demo account and closed out the two as it went below that low so i was managing your expectations i was showing you what to do with your demo account if you were doing anything and engaging and then i did my version of it so i was given the instructions first and then when the market started going up i outlined this order block here it started to repel away from that i actually mentioned i wanted to see price stay below this level here all i did was extend this and then mentioned that uber taken order block here was problematic i had anticipated if you watch on there in that short term video i had pulled up the partial close of three more contracts and my stop i hadn't moved except for moving the break even a little bit better than break even after i took the partial here and then once it went above this order block here that's when i closed three more contracts before the stop also hit now i could have closed the entire order but to me that would feel like panic okay i don't mind a stop loss getting hit because that's teaching you that's what they're paid to do you're paying a stop loss to do its job i'm not worrying about price going higher than my stop loss but if i have an ability to take something off before the stop is going to go there and maybe maybe it goes close to the stop loss and it doesn't hit it i've taken something off which was that initial partial here plus three more contracts and i had a remaining three contracts that got stopped out better than even so i didn't scratch on any position i didn't take in my opinion large enough position off down here in retrospect but that's how it's going to be for you now the question is going to be this why did i pick this candle why was i concerned about it when it went above it and why did i close the three contracts when it went above that how did i know it was reversing basically what you're asking now if you look at this sell side liquidity pool we have outlined here that was explained on twitter it's also been shown on this video here at the beginning of the video so if you look at the liquidity up here the old lows we went below that so south side's been tapped here then it went lower and created a relative equal lows here creating what another level of sell side below that went below that so we now have another low formed here what's resting below that sell side people are always trying to buy lows they're trying to pick bottoms so the sell side gets taken once more here and then this low gets taken here so notice what's occurring we went below cell side here here here here here and here without moving very much notice that so after we've taken buy side liquidity here it should have been off the races and went lower and this should have capped price on the upside because it's an up-close candle institutional overflow my rules for teaching that to you is if we're bearish and overflow is bearish this should have stopped price like it did here it should have maybe touched it one more time here or just bumped above that short-term high and then went aggressively lower it did not do that that's why if you watch the video of me actually doing the trade i actually pull up the order to take three off because i'm watching to see if this is going to fail because it didn't tear off and take that low out because it was reaching back up in this order block and then started going into it i knew i was going to get smoked on the stop so it would be easier for me to just take partial three off which i had pulled up on my chart ready to go versus just clicking the closing the entire trade which in my opinion wouldn't be as instructional for you because i want to show you how you can still many times take something off again and it might not hit your stop-loss and then it resumes going in your favor and hopefully you can add those three contracts or whatever the portion would have been if you had taken the trade put them back on at it you know as a pyramiding type thing but because we took this up close candle out that was problematic because we had multiple levels of sell side taken below the original sell side liquidity that was outlined in the beginning of the day on twitter so in short what should have happened was we ran the buy side here that should have been the high of the day and then it broke lower but because it took out this candle here after taking multiple levels of cell side what's the algorithm going to do seek by side where is it now above this high here so it's doing that run up here and then back above midnight opening handle price at opening new york local time at midnight and in the afternoon if my son has taken a trade in the morning and was profitable he'll do another trade in the afternoon he's aiming for either 8 30 or 9 30 for his morning session move if he gets his five points at 8 30 he won't trade at 9 30. if he misses something at 8 30 he'll try at 9 30. either or he's trying to do one time in the morning now he can take a a loss at 8 30 then he can try to make it back with the 9 30 set up if he misses the 9 30 setup or takes a loss in the morning he can trade the afternoon if he makes money in the morning i tell him paper trade or demo trade the afternoon okay why why not push your edge if you have an edge ict if your son's so good and he's doing what he's being taught to do why shouldn't he be trading every session move because i'm not teaching him to be greedy i'm teaching him discipline because if he can see that he can make more and chooses not to do it there's a certain measure of confidence assurity contentment knowing that you can go in these markets anytime and get it and that fact that understanding that realization is a piece of mind that keeps me from going in and over trading it keeps me from going in and doing more than it's necessary and it never allows me to fear and keeps me from ever fearing that these things are going to stop working like i understand that i get lots of new students and they see what i'm doing and they're afraid that all these people that are following me are somehow going to break the market because they're all doing the same thing no because you're going to find setups that are going to be different than i'm entering and i can do a lot other things that aren't even in charts so i'm not worried about these things failing because i taught more people to deal because if you look at the folks on my twitter feed that are just you know subscribing to me and they're looking at everything i say and they think that's a code word for take a butt or take a sell and that's they're rushing in to take a trade they need to be slowing down there's always going to be people out there that just because they're being exposed to this content they're not going to be disciplined enough and they're going to be people that come to this youtube channel and they are watching these videos and they're studying the concepts and they're never going to make it work for themselves not because they don't work but because they're doing things with them in an undisciplined manner they're doing things willy-nilly they're trying to you know recreate the wheel because they want to be able to say they did something they made something they created it it's their authorship it's their concept it's their thing their model their approach to what they learned from me because it's clout they want cloud clout is the thing everybody wants right now clicking the buttons watch my videos come to my channel you know that type of thing attention to me and those types of people aren't going to be the successful ones the ones that don't care about being looked at or cared to be followed they're going to be probably the best out of the entire fold here because that's how it is in my private group the ones that are the most quiet they're the ones that are doing it the best they're not trying to make an image on themselves they only care about the results and their results are significant enough for them not to look for outward you know approval but in the afternoon what was the time i taught you in this mentorship when is the afternoon session for pm session trading in index futures after lunch but specifically what time 1 30. so at 1 30 right here we're leaving an area of buy stocks that have been taken it's breaking down then the market returns back to a bearish breaker there then it starts to go lower we have displacement here that could have been an entry there once more low taken here and now we have wealth of equal lows they are broken there see that this is what i'm training my son to see this is a valid setup but i'm looking for these types of things for him because look what this is this low this low and this low what's resting below that sell side liquidity on a bearish day so does it want to drive down into that it does does it create an imbalance there it does does it trade back up into it yes that's where he's going to be selling short and he's looking for his five points and then he's watching and studying does it go to that 40-70 level that i was talking about does it go down to that daily fair value gap that i was talking about before the market opened this morning and those things will deposit pseudo experience that over time results into real experience and then he can lean on those instances of experience where he's been here before he's not intimidated if he's done it wrong he's not fearful that the market's changing the way it does things because he's now suddenly profitable and it has a you know series of losing trades or whatever he's not losing his mind because he has taken a trade that he felt was lined with likelihood and probabilities in his favor but then failed he's not discouraged by that because he knows that these things repeat so best case scenario there's three opportunities for him a day he's looking for just one of them to yield five points if he does he makes more than half of his weekly salary on that one trade he's trying to do that once in the morning once in the afternoon he's taking a live trade in one or the other but once he gets one live trade he's trying to condition himself to do demo or he'll paper trade it whatever just watch it observe but he's not trying to do three trades a day initially i forced him into doing that i said take a trade in the morning take a trade in 8 30 take a trade at 9 30 take a trade at the afternoon and then take and also sometimes at three o'clock to four o'clock that market on closed macro that runs by the algorithm there's a little setup that forms most days of the week in that last hour it looks similar to this it might be a buy day it might be a buy setup not just a short setup but i'm taking you into specific times of the day time i'm taking him to the market at these times okay if you have not been paying attention this video i've literally laid in your lap the very moments that these setups are forming it's up to you to go through your charts and find out if that is true the lazy won't do it they want to be told what to do they don't want to go in and roll their sleeves up and find it but once you see this once you see it and you back test and you pull out with example after example after example of how the market sets up like this and it runs to liquidity above or below the marketplace count how many times over the last month three weeks two weeks one week how many setups offered five points with something just like this at these key times of the day and then do the math if you could just do one half of that or just one quarter of that with one mini it's real easy to see how it's just a matter of time before that thing you call a job no longer is a hindrance to you because it is a hindrance to you where you have your faith chained to their bosses generosity they're so generous that they make you work those 40 hours sometimes more to get that paycheck that uncle sam gets the tax before you touch it and you come out and find out that everything's much more expensive today when you have this skill set folks i want you to understand what i'm about to say and i'm going to close this video when you learn this skill set it removes fear it removes fear of missing out it removes the fear and anxiety of failing but it also removes the fear of inflation because this skill set will always outpace inflation i don't care if gas is 20 dollars a gallon i'm sure i'm gonna drive my corvettes i have eight cylinder corvettes that i absolutely will not leave parked i will drive them and i will enjoy them i don't care gas can be whatever it wants to be it's a write-off for me okay i don't care how much food is going to cost i hope i i can continuously find it but i'm not worried about what my utility bills are going to cost i don't worry about what things are going to cost that skill set that you're learning here it aids in that it helps in that notice i'm not promising you get rich notice i haven't said that because i don't want you coming to my channel thinking i'm promising you to get rich but i am promising you a skill set that offers the opportunity to do limitless limitless feats and wonders and it's only limited by your imagination how much work you're going to put into it how much work have you put into it who are you allowing to influence you and discourage you distract you are you seeing results am i proving this stuff works do you feel scammed or do you feel energized and thankful that you're part of a community like we have here that's thriving it's energetic they're happy they're uplifted they encourage one another and everyone here knows that they're not being taken for a ride there's no upsell coming doesn't that feel good it frees you up to just concentrate on learning there's no angle there's no sales pitch coming isn't that awesome isn't that cool that's like the the point is is you're you're in a community that we're all trying to help one another and all i'm trying to be is the captain of the team and just lead you in the right direction and hopefully avoid the pain and struggles that i went through real accounts real money real buttons are being pushed you are going to find that there is a lot of opportunity that you're going to let slip by and not be upset about it it's going to be one of the most fun experience that you're going to have as a developing and developed student of price action under me is you'll see so many setups you're like i could do this trigger now but i'm not going to and then walk away from after it comes to fruition thinking i could have done that and i had the discipline to say no because i'm not being influenced by fear or greed and when you're at that level and you're consistent you have graduated you are an independent thinker you have mastered fear and greed you have operated with a level of discipline that is unknown to majority of traders on youtube instagram facebook wherever that day is coming for you but you got to go through this stuff here to get to it it's not hiding from you i'm not making it hard for you i've literally taught you everything except for money management which we'll talk about next week and then you have the complete understanding of what it is you're doing here and you're just gonna do the same thing every day sometimes you'll get it right some days you won't when you get it wrong you stop you don't rush to get it back you're gonna find the next day sometimes there it is which he took as a loss the previous day comes back sometimes with interest and that's a good feeling when it happens it's like well you know i don't need to worry about it you know losing trades is like getting a flat tire it sucks it costs you a little bit of money and time delays you from what you're trying to get to and accomplish but it's just a speed bump cost a little bit of time and money but it didn't keep you from getting where you're going it just created a detour a delay but the inevitable happens still nonetheless you arrive at your destination your destination here is excellence and you don't get there overnight you get there gradually one step in front of the other a little bit here a little bit there sometimes you have to take a step or two back get your footing again and resume going forward and sometimes you'll have to take a detour once in a while that's all part of it that's the that's the growth that every trader goes through but when it gets hard for you when you feel like you want to quit that's a moment when you need to take a break take a week off don't watch my videos they'll be here i'm not taking my videos down take a week away from it enjoy another hobby and then come back to it fresh you want this to be enjoyable you do not want to make it i have to do this it must work i got to get out of my job right now because this is going to make it harder and longer for you to learn it have fun with it enjoy it i have to ask a question here and then obviously by the number of comments in either support of it or there's no interest in it whatever but if you'd be so kind to let me know in the comments section if you would like to see me do a very short i'm talking like two minute three minute review each day where the setups were for the s p and or nasdaq i'm not going to do both of because it takes too much time to do that but where were there setups for you to engage with what i'm teaching you here in this mentorship if you'd like to see that as a monday through friday short little upload just let me know in the comment section below also if you could include also what your experience has been so far under my teachings on this youtube channel has it been a positive experience for you has it been not so much of a impact on you or has it been just simply waffle maybe i'm you know missing the mark entirely be honest with me but just be respectful if if it hasn't been your cup of tea yeah you can respectfully tell me that and that's okay i'll just use your feedback to hopefully try to dig in a little bit deeper and and maybe i can find something that helps you or maybe not i don't know but i'm looking for feedback and that way you can help me in that regard in the comment section below and until i talk to you next time lord willing on tuesday enjoy your weekend and be safe

all right folks welcome back this is going to be kind of like the direction we're going to be going in the future with the channel here i'm wrapping up the mentorship teachings for this model and we'll be just basically doing reviews and index futures forex commodities one and it's applicable and i posted that on twitter that's kind of like a short little promo and everybody was excited thinking that i'm gonna be doing like 30 different markets every single day it's not what i'm doing so kind of give you a flavor for what it is that we will be doing uh the mentorship group that i have with us a private group i no longer make videos for them and one of the reasons why i started this project here is to steer people away from wanting to buy videos that aren't going to help you anyway so when you're buying old videos i'm talking about market moves for that particular day so it's not going to be as useful to you so to keep people from profiting off of pirated videos i stopped making videos in my private group and i make them here publicly now some of my students are upset that i did that others that understand why i'm doing it are in support of it i'm not going to argue or wrestle with the opinions of who's in support of and who isn't supportive i look at it this way the folks that would have an issue with it they're probably the ones that are trying to sell pirated videos so now i've removed their market so you're a fool if you're going out there and you're buying all these instagram guys that are selling my videos i got ict mentorship 2021 2022 2020 19 all the way back to 2016. you know folks they're not going to help you because you weren't there when it was given at the time it was given that's being mentored so that's what i'm kind of doing here and i do on my twitter account so that way we understand why i'm doing it and what motivates me to do it so there won't be a lot of markets obviously being covered each day i'll be looking at the markets that i was referring to either on twitter or i actually took trades in so it's not a matter of talking about something that no one expected me to have an interest in which is predominantly what you see here on youtube and instagram and twitter and facebook and discord and you know it's the list goes on and on so today one minute before 8 30. i apologize i was waiting for my phone to update it's software and by the time i got back on to twitter i had one minute left to type out everything that i posted and you can go my twitter feed and you'll actually see the post in here too but on the economic calendar there was a high impact news driver for canadian dollar and i said i would start working in forex when there's a lot of you are specifically interested in forex because that's predominantly what i'm known for i've moved away from forex recently because i wanted to be a part of the stock index futures market and i'm still engaged obviously in that i did some live trades today and i'll share some of that with you as well but i was covering the canadian dollar and what i was outlining is kind of like this idea and we're gonna use it also to work within the scope of the teaching on daily bias and we'll get into that in a later time in this video but right away when you look on the left hand side this chart here is a dollar cad daily chart and on the right hand side it's the hourly chart of the same pair dollar cut notice that we saw last week the market traded up just bumped the short-term high here with that daily high what do we see once that occurred what formed on that daily chart you want to pause the video here all right if you need more time pause the video because i'm about to continue when the market ran into that old high here it hit it then the next day it created a lower high candle so we have one candle a higher candle high here on candle two and candle three or day three so this is what i dub a swing high i'm not using a williams fractal on mt4 i don't use mt4 this is not mt4 platform and five candles if you're waiting for five candles you missed the boat so this swing high at an old high did it run it not by much but it did that movement right here shown clearly on the hourly chart and the following day creating a high that has a lower high than the highest one that ran into that old high so we have a three bar pattern one candle the lower candle to the left a lower candle to the right that's a swing high pretty simple stuff then the next day i'm going to be expecting the market to trade lower now here's the problem with this particular market yes it's likely to trade down and with the benefit of hindsight i'm showing you here but again i tweeted about this beforehand so at 8 29 a.m eastern standard time you can see that is on my twitter feed if it's dropping down we have this down close candle here so it could be met with some resistance digging into this range of this down closed candle about half of its body right in here and not surprising you can see that's pretty much where we close that candle here on the 21st of june 2022. so when we look at this dashed line here what i'm anchoring to is the opening on this down closed candle because that is a bullish order block now i'm not suggesting that we went into that to go higher i'm just saying that as we started this down move it's digging into this candle so that's going to be the impediment to a big sudden one big candle that would take us down into this area here and clear out this so over to the hourly chart you can see last week we ran up into it started drifting lower fair bay gap here it rebalances to that drops back down consolidates between this high and the low here comes back in drops once more attacking the cell stops here consolidates once more breaks digs into that order block again that's this level here so watch what happens it goes into it overnight then it rallies this rally here is ahead of the 830 news driver on the economic counter you can find it on 4xfactory.com but this movement here this is all manipulation that takes us up into an imbalance here a fair value gap running a short term high buy side has been taken when it runs here that's anchored above this short-term high the chart on the left here is a 15-minute time frame for a dollar cad and the chart on the right is a five minute chart on the economic account you can see at 8 30 in the morning june 21st 2022 we had a high impact news driver for core retail sales and medium impact retail sales number yellow events i'm not interested in red or medium impact high or medium impact those are the news drivers i'm looking for so if we look at the price movement on the five minute chart you can see that once we ran up initially at seven o'clock in the morning what is seven o'clock in the morning new york time that's the beginning of my ict new york kill zone it's extended to 10 o'clock in the morning when it's 4x so 7 o'clock to 10 in the morning near the local time the market creates a short-term high then runs above that so we have buy side taken then the market drops just below here but i want to have a more meaningful displacement okay we want to see something that's more energetic this little toe in the water type thing here that's not enough we want to see it fall in okay so it drops down that short term low here that's your shift in market structure energetic displacement and that candle is exactly when that news driver came out of 8 30. so all of this is news driver related economic calendar manipulation and the market is going to cause people to want to sell short and chase it going lower it creates a fair value gap in here on the five-minute chart but there also is a fair value gap here now ahead of the news you might be thinking well couldn't you have sold short here yes you could have but the economic drivers that come at 8 30 could have sent it up higher and taken us into this area here so really it's a matter of waiting for the news to hit the market and then create the setup that's a little bit more conservative there are times when it's so obvious that they're going to continue the move that starts ahead of the new driver but it takes a little bit more experience to find those setups and trust them i would rather you use your demo account to see these types of moves real time wait for them to form and then go in and engage them with your demo not try to forecast how much of a move it's going to further increase higher or lower once the new driver comes out or the news event hits the marketplace relative equal lows down here there's your sell side so we had this fair value got formed after buy side was taken here but now this creates an area of buy side that once this trades lower we have this fair value gap and then we have this very value gap so it could run up into that level with the volatility so you have to make sure that you have that defined with your risk management the draw on liquidity is likely to pull down in here or into this fair value gap and we'll talk a little bit more about why that's the case but eventually it trades down into it bagged and tagged sells liquidity the tweet i posted again you can see this at 8 29 a.m june 21 2022 i just made it on twitter but basically saying good morning folks dollar cad is about to have some volatility note the sell side and buy side on your 5 and 15 minute charts sell side is here buy side would be here study if it wants to run sell side before buy side or rebounds to a discount what does that mean at the news driver release it could go up and bump the buy side then dig in for the imbalance here that's a discount or run the sell side out here so all of this movement up since five o'clock in the morning new york local time this was just the head of that news driver here so they were building in a premium then during the new york kill zone it gave you the setup that i teach in this model delivered to the fair value gap and delivered to the south side of koji pool between this high and that low here is equilibrium so we have to find a discount array below that if we're going short that's the favorite a gap here you can take a partial there and target the sell side liquidity which you can see it does that as well here and here i tweeted and i failed actually include that tweet i wish i would have put it in here now but i mentioned how the market reacted here like that and i stated that's the reason why you want to take partials because you don't know if it's going to come all the way back up and then revisit the sphere of a gap and lose the opportunity to bank something when it goes into your first opportunity discount array when going short now i've dropped down into a four-minute chart and i dimmed the fair value gap that i mentioned earlier that you could have taken that trade but it'd be ahead of the news driver and it's a little bit more riskier but you wait for the displacement short term low is taken then we have a shift in market structure and the imbalance would be between this low of this candle and the high of this candle in here now by itself this is a rather elongated imbalance so all of this cell side delivery is imbalanced and there's not enough by side delivery so it's going to want to wait for the market to come back up in here in forex there is no central measure of volume okay and in the algorithm that delivers price that is going to want to come back up and overlap this down move and offer buyers an opportunity to get in on that this is too much of a movement one-sided so the market offers that rebalancing so if that's the case where in this range would we be looking for for an entry knowing that this fair value got could be revisited and you're gonna have to utilize that for your stop loss so your stop would have to be here doesn't matter where you're going short in between this low and this high you have to define the risk with the stop here based on the model i'm teaching you now some of you are like oh this is too much you know because if i went in at 129.45 and i put my stop here that's almost 12 pips that's too much no it's not it's all relative you can scale that's one of the benefits of forex it's very scalable whereas if you're trading futures you're kind of stuck to whatever the contract size is and you've got to either make it work or you can't take the trade or you're basically over leveraged which is what you don't want to be doing so if we look at that range from that high down to that low and drop a fib on it we're going to get a measurement of 50 here that's our equilibrium price point so really we need price to get to that point or higher so by definition we could be looking for a short here up to here and that would look like that so that was that's really the range that you'd be wanting to sell short in so you're not really risking a lot of pips but you're defining the entry a little bit better even though it goes above it a little bit that's okay but the bottom line is it eventually gets in sync watch the bodies of the candle support that premium high of the imbalance beautiful delivery then it starts to break lower one more time false little rally takes buy side liquidity once more then the real move starts to unfold trades into the fair value gap here take partials so that way if this reverses on you you're paid and drops below a low where engineered south side liquidity would be and then digs into the cell cell equity over here so your entry could be 129.44 129.47 in that range anywhere near is reasonable it's acceptable obviously the closer you get to this level you may not have been filled it might just leave some of that open and then start to roll over but as you can see here goes a little bit further that's fine that's why we have to utilize this level here for our stop loss based on the model's rules that i've taught in the 2022 youtube mentorship alright so i have a four minute chart here with all the details shown south side the quality pool relative equal lows from the morning it rallies up creates a high after running buy-side liquidity it breaks down consolidates and gives a short-term swing low here with an energetic run lower at the high impact news event at 8 30. rebalance stop goes here and it rolls over during the 10 o'clock till 11 o'clock but that time frame 10 to 11 that's london close so if you're looking for directional plays and you're in a trade you want to have about 80 percent of your trade off between 10 o'clock and 11 o'clock in the morning because usually not all the time but usually that's when it creates the opposing end of the daily range so if it's creating the high of the session here the low is likely to form between 10 o'clock and 11 o'clock that's algorithmic now there are some times if there's news events sometimes canadian dollars influenced by crude oil numbers and that would sometimes skew this time window 10 to 11 so on those days when there's crude oil inventory numbers coming out and i'm interested in trading the loony i will trade with the expectation between 10 o'clock to noon and not have such a tight little window of 10 to 11. and i promise you i have students for days and days and days and years and years now that will confirm that this has not just been form fitted for this example i've always taught that 10 o'clock until 11 o'clock in the morning is london closed profit taking hour i'm quite sure if you go through the older teachings i have in this youtube channel you'll probably actually hear me talk about that very thing as well all right so we're going to talk about the e-mini s p futures contract this is the september contract for 2022. if you're following along on tradingview and i hope you are the symbol you would be utilizing for calling up the data for this contract is esu 2022 okay and that would give you this chart here this is a daily chart and before i get into it i want to talk a little bit about daily bias okay so this topic is one of the most requested topics that i would cover and i have done many teachings on it i've done amplifications i've done revisits to this idea and i know what you're wanting okay because it's what i wanted as well you want a simple abc one two three it always works it's always going to be the same way it's always going to be the same procedure process and it's always going to give you a winning trade now some of you are already folding your hands and hissing because you're like oh that's not what i want that's not what i want you're exaggerating michael no that's really what you want and you want me to give you a very simple cookie-cutter approach to find daily bias and i want you to understand that i've taught these things many times throughout the lessons and lectures and series that's found on his youtube channel this is the simplification that i make for daily bias if you stick to these rules you will know how to find daily bias as i teach it my students follow these rules okay i'm going to go through them with you and you're going to be kicking and screaming and saying there's something else you're holding back there isn't it's experience it's doing it yourself but the keys to daily bias are simply this everyday bias is unrealistic if i go in looking for a specific predetermined daily bias before the market starts trading invariably i'm going to have it incorrect notice i said that i'm not perfect some of you hold me up to this hero level status and i'm not a hero okay i'm just somebody that knows what they're looking for and knows how to avoid hopefully making the same mistakes over and over again because i'm looking for a procedure and process that will lead to an outcome that generally not all the time but generally yields a specific result so i'm not trying to get a daily bias every single day i'm trying to determine the likely weekly expansion and again what is that i utilize a weekly chart and i studied that and i want to see does it look like it's going to run to an old low does it look like it's going to run to an old high or is it running to a imbalance below the market price or is it trying to run to an imbalance above the market price or is it likely not to move because there's no data for it for that week and other markets have high impact or medium impact news that would be more interesting and the algorithm will be working those pairs or markets and the pairs or markets that don't have a high impact or medium impact driver will probably be a lackluster market environment i'm looking for the direction of an expansion move i'm not trying to get the entire weekly range i'm not trying to buy the weekly low and sell the weekly high i can but that's not what i'm trying to do you don't need to do that okay i know some of you hate when i do that but i'm trying to make sure that you understand there's a distinction between what you should be coming into this with in terms of expectations and what is realistic okay in the beginning all you're trying to do is determine is it likely to expand higher is there going to be a big move a flurry of activity going higher during the week or going lower during the week and by itself that is huge in terms of what you're trying to pick now you might be wrong because sometimes i get it wrong but i'm looking for some volatility in a direction based on what i'm studying on a weekly chart so this is a daily chart shown on this slide here the same thing i would be doing to determine where the daily charts going i'm trying to do that with a weekly chart but i'm only interested in seeing what's it likely to reach for i'm not trying to predict the weekly closing price on that candlestick i'm trying to look for where is the bulk of that volatility going to be pushing higher or lower and why would it be like that and it's as simple as what i mentioned earlier is it aiming for and gravitating towards an old high to run above it or is it gravitating towards an old low to run below it or is there an imbalance where it needs to come back and revisit that because it might just drop down to a fair value gap to go higher longer term i don't even need to know that all i need to know is what direction is it most likely to have the majority of the volume pushing through now when i say volume there is no centralized volume number in 4x when i say the volume that means the the interest the the chaos the energy all the activity the action okay is it gonna be on the higher side reaching for buy side or is it gonna be on the lower side reaching for sell side that's what i'm looking for i want to find where is it likely to gun for this particular week who's in the crosshairs have people been making money going long is there a low they're gonna try to run down and stop them out with it that would be enough for me to frame an expansion going lower so i'm looking for obvious liquidity in that direction below old lows above old highs or identifying imbalances and price delivery top down that means from the weekly down to the daily down to the four hour down to the one hour to the 15 minute chart and then once we get to the five minute chart you do the scalings from five four three two and one whichever has the clear obvious fair value gap for you based on the model's rules and i focus on days that have high or medium impact calendar events only so if you go through your economic calendar in fact you can look at next month's economic counter they're already there where are the high impact or medium impact news events for the markets that you trade what day of the week and what time so if you have a news driver that's coming out on a particular day say tuesday or wednesday and you're expecting the weekly range to expand lower well on those medium impact or high impact news events i'm going to see hopefully something that is going to run up higher go into a fair value gap or run above a short term high run stops then break down show displacement then create a fair value gap and i can go in short on that and i'm doing that and looking for that setup and that directional price run inside my kill zones intraday at the same time the economic calendar is suggesting a high impact or medium impact news event is likely so what did i just teach you here i basically said that there is absolutely no expectation on my part to know the bias every single day of every single calendar trading day i'm only focusing on these sweet spots these low hanging fruit days where everything's coming to get all the stars are lining okay i'm looking for the higher time frame weekly to expand in a specific direction that starts my bias then if i think it's going to be going higher going lower for a specific target or imbalance then i'm going to go to the economic calendar to look for when that might occur now there may be a move that happens prior to the economic calendar event occurring and that's just going to be a missed opportunity so you have to use something else some other pair something else that you got the trade with sometimes that occurs but you'll see that there's a lot of opportunities using this criteria and it's very forgiving for you as a developing student because it's already given you permission not to know the daily bias outside of these rules so you want to trade every single day because you want to be the everyday trader i don't want to be the everyday trader the everyday trader is more prone to have losing trades because they are trying to do something every single day when there are times when you should not be trading at all and that's what makes me different from all the other educators out there because i have made a career out of knowing how not to destroy myself because that's what i did when i was a 20 year old i thought that i could trade every single day and that's problematic when you don't know how to trade and you have a lot of time or lack of self-control and that's why i was blowing accounts when i was 20 and 21 and 22. that fevered pace of i got to do it i got to do it i want to miss that next move when hopefully you've seen now enough instances where this pattern repeats a lot over the course of a month it's in most markets a few times a week but if you notice those moves are occurring when there's a high impact or media impact news driver on the econo calendar so it's something that you can plan for you ever hear them the old cliche remarks of books and educators they say plan your trade and trade your plan well this is how you can do that with that model you look for the economic calendar the time of day what kill zone in the market you're expecting an expansion high or low on that weekly chart there it is you're looking for these things to repeat and if you start journaling these things you're going to notice that the setups this is one of the epiphanies okay because i know some of you just don't want to do this but now because i'm going to tell you you're going to go into it hopefully and see that what i'm saying is true if you backlog every day show everything that took place mark up your charts as i'm going to show you in some examples in here when that happens over time you're going to see that the best setups occur when these calendar events are in play and they originate around that same time and what will happen is it'll convince you to say okay i don't need to be the everyday trader i don't need to be in here being super scalper i don't need to be in here trying to be an olympic trader because trading is not an olympic sport it's not an olympic event and they don't give out gold medals for over trading but they do blow accounts so eventually doing that enough and if you don't know what you're doing you're going to blow your account and that's hopefully what i'm trying to prevent you from enduring all right so we're looking at the hourly chart here on the s p obviously we've traded down we left relative equal lows but this low went just a little bit lower than that one that's all we need it hits that and it started retracing higher this movement here that's whip sawing both sides of the marketplace sell side taken and then buy side taken and then it broke down whenever i see price action like this i ignore the both side type movement usually it's fomc or some kind of rate announcement type event and that's what you're seeing here when i see that i ignore that wick and i ignore all these as well the real range is here this is manipulation it's already done it's not going to hurt you focus on this swing here so when the market drops down it creates this low runs a little bit lower we're consolidating we had a holiday on monday the market starts to drift higher and what i'm concerning with this run here is this high to that low and i'm getting my range equilibrium is here so if it's going higher what's it reaching for well it's going to go into a premium and then this right here this imbalance i'm not really interested in that one because it's overlapping with that equilibrium 50 level of the high to that low so i want to see it dig into a premium so even if this is going to go up to go down i want to know do i have an opportunity to see it go up into this area here or maybe even up here so we'll use the first low-hanging fruit approach here so we have fair value gap there in balance sell side only the market's going to want to revisit that area this is exactly what i teach you this is exactly what happened look at the bodies of the candles yes there's a little bit of movement just above this candle's low but look at the bulk of these candles the bodies they're staying within that range that's defined by what i teach you as a fair value gap in a premium market what makes it a premium it's above the 50 level so it's gone up into that level here it's consolidating on the 15-minute time frame pause the video look for what you can identify based on your understanding and experience learning under me so far okay if you need more time pause the video all right so here's midnight new york local time we had a fair value gap here pull a shoulder block these last three down closed candles that's one consecutive order block it digs into the order block with the fair value gap hits that during the london session it rallies up we create a fair value gap here it runs by side here and then creates relative equal highs ahead of the new york session so the market drops down goes into the fair value gap here into the last down closed candle bull shoulder block there that's where you could be a buyer ahead of the 9 30 opening why would you feel confident to do that because we already have an energetic price run from london open the market started at midnight and went where did it go up no it went down into an imbalance and then there was a lot of energy off of that so the market created a short-term shift in market structure here that's bullish london creates the higher the load most of the time 70 of time you're going to find that that is true if your directional bias is correct so i'm trusting that that low is probably pricing in the daily low this retracement into the new york session we're trading into an order block we close up this fair value gap then we rally a little bit and drop back down into the fair bay gap once more creating optimal trade entry that's not what we're going to focus on this one here but we have the new york am session beginning here from 8 30 in the morning to 11 this is specific to index futures for the morning session this is the upper level in that fair value gap on the hourly chart and this is the lower level on the hourly fair value gap so that's your targets it's going to be a draw on liquidity the market runs from the fairway gap here to the low of the fair value gap on the hourly chart to the high the fair value gap on the hourly chart after clearing buys liquidity on a 5-minute chart there's a lot of things going on here you can see we have a low then we ran that low once more then it rallies and moves up away from the order block and then back down into the last down closed candle on the five-minute chart so there's an hierarchy of how the market's trading down into a higher time frame to a lower time frame to a lower time frame all being supported by down closed candles within the bias that's bullish and once fair value gaps are being closed in the market goes higher so it's signaling to you it's indicating to you that you don't need an indicator you don't need some wonky little gimmicky candlestick replacement okay the candlestick is telling you everything you need to know you don't need to have any kind of indicators no moving averages none of that garbage okay everything is being shown here in price action relative to time and price so we have the market starting with a run from this low with a lower low so what took place here we'll come back to that in a minute mark comes back down into a short-term discount relative to the low to high here discount rallies and at 9 30 it's consolidating and then it starts to run reaches for the bicep liquidity here the low of the fair bay gap on the hourly chart and the high the fair value gap on the hourly chart as it draws on liquidity three targets all hit i'm going to zoom in and this is a zoomed in chart of the session that starts at 8 30 and going into the 9 30 opening so we have the low here lower low into the order block it rallies short term shift in market structure here comes back down in there's an imbalance or if every gap here these levels are based on the five-minute chart so even though we're looking at a smaller time frame than that that's what we're looking at but we're going to refine that down into this particular time frame so inside that let me go back up one more slide so inside the fair value gap we're dropping down in here but we're doing it into this very value gap there down close candle that's an order block and fair value gap there it is you can buy this right there and trust that it's not likely to take that low out why because we already had a stop running event here low lower low sell side taken reaction off the order block we're into the fair value gap we rallied once more we created a fair value gap here drop down that last down closed candle you can be a buyer there there's buy side liquidity resting up here that's going to be your initial draw on liquidity so that'd be a first partial if you want to add if you want to pyramid the position you can add that as it starts to run up higher but i want to show you the low to the high here that's 50 or equilibrium the market drops into a discount prior to that run up here this consolidation at 9 30 we see it taking off here it's already done the move of manipulation knocking people out retracing then off to the races so this is a case where you do not need to wait for nine thirties opening to get that volatility to get these type of manipulation moves this is an early setup discount fair value gap and rallies so notice what's happening we have an hourly discount that we're trading into here then it creates a short-term discount relative to this low to this high that's we're seeing here then the market rallies here comes back down into an order block and fair value gap discount rallies consolidates ahead of 9 30. is it likely to trade back down and take that low out no because it's already closed in the only fair value gap that's here see that so if you're up here looking back it's already rebalanced this there's no reason for it to go down it doesn't need to go down here because it's already shown a willingness to want to rally and this run didn't need to go over here because this low took out that low so that is all framework in narrative so all of that comes together now also couple that with the 830 news that took place in the dollar cad i'm showing you how these two markets relate to one another with the proper context and bias dollar cad what is the currency's first pair in its name dollar so if we're expecting as i was hinting it on twitter it going down to a discount or running sell side liquidity that means the bias is bearish so if the bias is bearish on dollar cad that means that it's a risk-on scenario so the markets like s p nasdaq other foreign currencies are going to be easier to rally versus going down in dollar pairs i'm not really interested in anything except for the dollar cad because dollar cad had the high impact news event so i don't need to go to the dollar itself when i have a high impact news event or one dollar cad i can go right to that and cut to the chase and determine what the bias is for the morning session because if i'm likely to see lower prices on dollar cad that's the same thing as saying lower dollar higher foreign currency and when the dollar goes down it's easy for spoos or e-mini s p stock index features to go higher and everything i've shown here is in concert with that idea so here we have that short-term high shift in market structure after the stop hunt retracement to a discount the fair value got buying here run to initial target buys liquidity relative equal highs here it runs that you can't see it here remember we're dropping down this is a three minute chart now it rallies up creates a fair value gap here overshoots it a little bit that's fine rallies once more and digs into the high of the hourly fair value gap and again kind of like what i was suggesting moments ago here is that movement up in the s p at the 9 30 time period when the dollar cad was trading down into its discount here so lower dollar cad higher s p so as a forex trader you could be selling short if you're not an s p trader or if you're not trading forex like me this is the long one s p and you can add in as it's taking out this short term high here you can look for pyramiding opportunities and what would that look like well i was in a 10 second chart i know some of you were surprised when i said that but here is the 9 30 opening here and we had a little bit of consolidation then we had a run higher creating the fair value gap between here and here the market dropped down i'm buying there it rallies up into that there's my entry you can see it right there that's the fill that's the price 37 41 and three quarters and as the market goes higher if you're trading like this you can take first partials at logical levels as i mentioned we were on the higher time frame charts and as it goes higher you just scale off what your model what your approach or your plan would allow for and then hold something for the rest of the day towards the close or at least try to see if you get a continuation into the afternoon session and that would be between 1 30 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon new york local time so hopefully this has been insightful to you hopefully it has helped you obviously in terms of using other markets for inter-market relationships for bias how to navigate markets these are the only two markets i talked about today and you can see how they had a synergy between them there was a a movement and kind of like a dance between them even though they're not correlated don't think that there's any kind of correlation between them it's the fact that it's risk on risk off that's all that it is and i was focusing primarily on dollar cad because dollar cad had its high impact news drivers for today so i was using that in relationship to what i would expect in the s p market and i found my trade by utilizing a market i'm not going to trade but if it's going to give me insights and it's going to go lower it helps me frame risk on risk off risk on that means foreign currencies index futures stocks go higher dollar goes down risk off is dollar higher and everything else going down so if you go into your day with those ideas risk on risk off it makes it a lot easier to look for supporting ideas with intermarket relationships correlations between assets like if you are trading like forex euro dollar versus cable uh euro dollar would be a better trade than say pound dollar if there is an inability for one of them to go low make a lower low and one doesn't do that that's showing you that's the relative strength leader that would be the better buy in this situation here another instance would be aussie dollar and kiwi dollar in new zealand dollar if you're looking at situations like this and you find a currency that fails to make a lower low intraday when it's risk on you would be buying the risk on higher low currency and i don't i didn't see i didn't look at the australian dollar and the kiwi this morning and it may not have presented it but if i were trading those pairs and i wouldn't really be trading them because the impact news driver on the account calendar is again on dollar cad so that's the market i would be trading so a lot of you ask all the time like how do you know which pair to trade how do you know which one to pick i'm starting that with the economic calendar but sometimes i may use that market for instance instead of being dollar cad today if euro dollar had a high impact news event i would compare pound dollar and euro dollar for correlation so i would look for smt diversions to signal which one i'd rather be in just because the news driver is in for instance the euro the better trade may be in pound dollar if they both went down prior to the news event coming out for euro and if pound dollar failed to make a lower low i'm buying pound dollar because they're going to most likely move in sympathy with one another because they're closely correlated but in the instance of dollar cad i'm not going to do anything except for focus on dollar cad because the economic calendar suggested that's where the volatility would be for forex today and you're welcome to go through the pairs and compare and contrast whether that's true or not i didn't do it but you can do that on your own and hopefully you got something out of this one until i talk to you on thursday for our discussion on money management that'll complete the 2022 mentorship teachings and we'll just continuously do market reviews on the youtube channel monday through friday so i'll obviously be back lord willing tomorrow on wednesday with a review on something either s p related or some kind of 4x pair and hopefully you'll learn something from that as well until next time be safe

all right folks welcome back this is our review and final discussion in the free 2022 ict mentorship for youtube so this is june 23rd 2022 and we're looking at the e-mini s p september contract for 2022 and this is an hourly chart so i'm cutting right to the chase here and this morning on twitter i was looking at well i was expecting actually a little bit more volatility around the fed chair pal speaking at 10 o'clock in the morning and we didn't get a whole lot of excitement but we did get to see ict's expectation fall short so that's one of the benefits of seeing it live with me an expectation an analysis a call a viewpoint a perspective opinion not coming to pass okay and time of day how i used it and how you should use it going forward and also how it kept me from looking at an incorrect setup that would otherwise maybe a catalyst for you having had a incorrect setup this morning and i'll talk about that in a moment but for now this is the framework for today we had sell side liquidity here the market dropped down took that sell side out rallied up buy side here i was looking for 38.05 level today and this is the reason why and i was looking at it early on in the morning i wanted to see it run up here and hit that if it was going to hit i would have been watching for a potential short deform but it didn't do it so that was my expectation based on this high back here we already took sell aside so i was looking for a little bit deeper run into this high here when we just went just above that short term high there gave up the ghost and went lower and i had a trade that got stopped out plus two points and i'll talk about that and get into the lower time time frame all right so here is the 15 minute time frame and usually i have the charts blank and i'll ask you to take a look at it i don't want to do that tonight because i want to get to the teachings at the end to kind of like bring this entire mentorship to a close the teachings itself will end for this model in this lesson okay so technically there's 41 videos that make up this mentorship so if you take away the introductory video it's basically what 40 even so that's not bad hopefully you found it insightful and helpful but looking at this morning we had the 10 o'clock pal event here and the market started to run up and we took out the buy side here but again i was aiming for this this is what i wanted to see i want to see it run up here and actually took a long in here i wanted to see it run up into that level and i was going to do a reversal and it didn't obviously give it to me so notice the time of day here this is new york index am session operating hours or killzone if you want to call it that and it's 8 30 in the morning to 11. now i can take trades after 11 o'clock but i want to kind of like stick to the rules and present you opportunities to see where following the rules you're going to miss certain opportunities it's okay it's fine now you're going to get it wrong sometimes you watch me get something wrong today there was no skin off my back nothing you know bad happened is i didn't get what i was looking for and because it was late in the day as we'll look at the lower time frame in a moment but it ran above the short term by side liquidity here i wanted to run up to here but it broke down and i was telling myself and also made my views public on twitter that i wasn't interested and i wasn't quite sure what it wanted to do because it was approaching that noon hour and i took a trade and i was out plus two so in other words i was just covering expenses basically and i was wrong on the initial run so when i have that scenario and it's off of a fed chair or a high impact news event and it didn't pan out like i was expecting it to in my experience it's been better for me to just move away and say okay i'm going to close the computer and i'll come back later on and see what's going on and i didn't want to trade any more of the morning session leading into noon so i had waited and i was gonna take a look at what it did in lunch hour and then post lunch hour around 1 30 and see what there was opportunity to do anything then but we have a fair value gap on the 15-minute time frame here you see that so the market eventually after running the bus side here drew all the way down took out cell side here overrun this fair value gap here why did it do that because this is a larger one so if it's going to go over top of this one and trade to the top of this candle which is the low end of that fair value gap that's here that's not noted on shown here by the respective candles it's going to go here that's also the high end of the fair value gap here so it's likely to go over top of this one and run into this one okay it does that as we're going into the noon lunch hour in new york until one o'clock where it makes the low of the session after closing in the fair value gap and then the 1 30 to 4 new york local time that's the pm session new york index pm session or afternoon session for index trading and the market started to create a willingness to want to go higher we'll look at a short-term shift in market structure when we get a lower time frame but it draws all the way back up to the target i was looking for in the morning so the expectation of going to that specific level let me explain to you what i was looking for i wanted to go above hit that and then sell off and go down to this area here for a discount and then create the run and then go beyond 3805 that's all i was really looking for today that's what i wanted to do but it failed to get to 3805 it fell down into this area here and i knew once it broke here i don't want to go short because i'm going into lunch hour and i was concerned it was going to consolidate a lot and then take forever to get down into and i don't want to hold anything new into lunch so i'd prefer to see some kind of a a stop run in the lunch hour which is what we're seeing here it runs down below that and into a fair value gap deep discount between low high trades down into it and then rallies up this session here we'll look at it on the five-minute chart so we can see obviously the initial poke above here inside this area i was looking at a two minute fair value gap i mentioned that on twitter as it was forming and it rallied up and then once it took the short-term high out when this was a bold face bullish candle i was thinking to myself okay it could expand up in here and i'm watching that and i had a tweet ready to go i'm gonna sell short here and look for a run down into this level here never got it okay and then some of you probably gonna hear this and say oh yeah sure you sure you did i mean it is what it is folks i mean i was out there without a safety net i told everyone what i was expecting what i was looking for it simply didn't pan out and that's okay but the market eventually breaks lower then after we get in to the lunch hour closing at one o'clock and then i personally like to wait till 1 30 because it's a little bit more cleaner price action the market starts to rally away drops back down into an order block a fair value gap on a five-minute chart then we have a shift in market structure here on the five-minute chart creates a small little return to a fair bag gap there rallies another fair value it runs into it here rallies and eventually takes up the short-term high of the day and then runs to the level i was drawing your attention to on twitter all right so here's the five-minute chart zoomed in with the morning session you see the run here on the buy side one more here and eventually breaking down displacement small little fair value got here rolls down into the fairway you got here and then once again you're turning back up into an imbalance then runs down to the low end of the thereby you got turning basically at the low of the session at the low end of the fair value got at one o'clock so closure of lunch time hour it creates that low right here is the two minute chart and this is the fair value gap i drew your attention to live and it came down into it here and inside this fairbank app is of basically drawing your attention to that as a potential long i did and i was looking for a run into 3805 and it started the run took out the buy side here i mentioned the bicep would likely be a draw on liquidity it was but i wanted to see it draw up to here that's the specific level i was looking for and if the market comes back down into the fairbank up again once more and then rallies above the short-term high here this right here would have been a nice opportunity for me to basically say pay the trader and me take something after i tweeted that off but i didn't because i wanted this level here okay now one could argue and say oh you're being greedy or you didn't follow rules or you didn't do this and you didn't do that and it's easy to arm chair quarterback someone and that's okay if you want to do that in the comment section that's fine but just know that i'm doing this real time and i'm okay with being wrong wrong isn't going to ruin me um i'm not 100 but i'm generally on par better than the average bear okay we'll just say it that way without sounding like i'm bragging but once it came back down in it stopped me out because i rolled my stop up to a level that i wasn't willing to weather a deeper retracement because this is the takeaway very valuable we trade down into it we get movement that's good comes back down and again complete closure of the fair value gap okay that's acceptable does it start to rally away yes that's why i felt confident that it was going to go up to here because if it's going to go above here then it should just spread its wings and run that 3805 level with no problem it wasn't having it the market dropped back down and didn't quite take out this short-term load with any displacement so while this fair value gap exists it's not one that i would have taken because we didn't see a displacement with meaningful movement below that low so this is not a fair gap that i would have been a participant in so looking at that i'm thinking i'm not interested i'm going to close up shop and there it is because i didn't get this run below here now had i seen that i may have i'm not going to go out on a limb and say absolutely but i may have if it would have shown like this type of movement on this candle below that low and then we move back up into this right here then i probably would have said well i'm gonna go short and aim for this low here and then at noon if i didn't get here i would just close it off and then ride out the the lunch hour so that was kind of like what was going on in my head because it was an event around pal i didn't want to give you guys a lot of things to be concerned about or get lost in the commentary and plus i didn't want to be worrying about someone doing something hurting themselves i knew invariably some of you are waiting there with a live account ready to click a button because i've said something okay so that weighs heavily on me when i comment on twitter so i just want you to be careful okay do it in a demo don't do it a live account but we had another fair value gap in here it trades up into that nice closure perfectly and runs down to the top of the fair value gap on that 15 minute time frame one more little bounce in then rolls over and goes deeper into the fair value cap all right here is the afternoon session and this is where we're gonna be doing the bulk of the discussion on the reading course in this video and i'll frame the logic around risk management and stop loss management and that'll complete the model the roles i'm going to give you are static they they're always the same so that way you know once you put a position on your demo account where is your stop how much are you risking when do you move your stop okay and this is the rule that i use and sometimes um you've seen me show trades where i get in and i'm not really trying to move my stop-loss i'm taking partials along the way but i'm not really trying to rush my stop-loss up i'm going to show you the rules i follow so that way it makes sense to you and it'll help you also trust taking partials letting that become a better way of managing a position in trade and not be fearful about being stopped out because the stop loss is there to do its job you pay it well to do that but if you're worrying about that stop loss being tripped versus following along in price action continuously measuring whether or not price is giving you what you're expecting in terms of bullishness or bearishness is the institutional order flow still bullish if you're long or is it still bearish when you're you know short those types of things are more important than worrying about whether you're getting stopped out or not that's not to minimize obviously the the risk that's respected obviously you should be respecting the risk by actually putting a hard stop in but if you don't put a hard stop in you're not really respecting the risk what you're saying is is i'm risking this trade because i believe i'm right but if i'm wrong i'll figure out where i'm wrong when it gets there you don't want to do that okay so anyway we'll close that portion of the discussion at the end of the video but here it's a two-minute chart showing the afternoon or pm session for index futures and you can see we traded down into this is showing a weird time because it's two minutes but this is the one o'clock hour it hits the low and then starts to rally up short term shift in market structure here key time of day 130 it trades back down into an order block last down closed candle there is a fair value gap right here i didn't note it because it's going to be too cluttered up and i'm going to be basically doing a lot of discussion in this area and i don't want it to be over lapped with too many things to me navigating so this is the 50 minute fair value gap and it's trading down to an order block after a shift in market structure after trading down and closing in a 15 minute time frame fair egg gap and then it trades into an optimal trade entry which is the flagship pattern of this youtube channel fair value gap with an overblock and optimal trade entry is the gold standard of the ict pattern that's taught on this youtube channel this is where you can be long and expect price to reach for here and here okay so we have objectives in here where we can look for this imbalance here bicep liquidity here by side liquidity here and we'll watch then see it does it continuously march higher so we have a run from here to the short term high then we have this fair value got here that runs here up into the 3805 level so this pm session i was long in and i'm not going to try to build the case to outline everything because i want to give you what's salient to close this mentorship and show you how to use stop placement risk management and give you a working example i know some of you like to see did i really take a trade yeah i was trading today so you can see here a live account and 1 975 okay back to the lesson and you'll see what it means to go through the process of determining risk management and stop loss placement and when you move your stop all right so we're zoomed in here and looking at the five-minute chart and again that's the fair value gap we're going to be using here the frame it so if you're looking at the idea of you trade it down into that very value gap does it show willingness to go higher yes is there a short term shift in market structure yes is there a gap yes down close candle to the left of it yes drops down in bullish order block optimal trade entry in other words that would be a 62 to 70 tracement level less than equilibrium relative to the high and the low respectively so we would be looking for a limit order to be at 37 54 75 we'll use that okay so one quarter point less than this candle's low so that would be our hypothetical limit order to buy going long and we use the low here for our stop loss so 37 45 0.75 essentially nine points of risk okay so we'll come back that in a couple minutes but for now what will be reaching for what would be the draw on liquidity from this high down to that low we want to get to a premium level 50 is about right in here eyeballing it and we don't need to have a fib on that you should do it for yourself but then we have this imbalance here so the first low hanging fruit objective would be this candle's high that's 37 80 and a quarter so we're looking at about 25 and a half handles of potential points profit per contract so we're risking nine points to make 25 and a half not bad it's better than two and a half r so you're gonna risk one dollar to make two dollars and fifty cents basically and that's on a run from here to here we don't need to know if it's going to go up to here yet okay this right here is one trade from here to here then it creates another opportunity in here where it can run from here to here and we'll talk about that when it gets into the discussion on risk management and trade management all right so risk management anytime you're trying to consider what lot size or how much you're supposed to be trading or whatever there are free tools if you google them okay it's amazing how many folks ask me and other educators out there the most simplest questions that are answered just by a google search okay i know it feels easier i think it's a matter of just getting a personal response from the educator or whoever it is you'd be asking and it's not possible for me to go through every single person's question and reply to them so hopefully you understand that there's just simply no way for me to do that i don't have enough time in the day to do that nobody really does but simple things like lot size calculators okay you can do a google search on that and there are some wonderful free applications and tools that will make that known to you by you just plugging in how much money you have in your account what risk percentage are you trying to use what size stop-loss are you going to use and it'll tell you how much leverage if you're trading forex or you know what your lot size should be for futures now i understand that's probably not the response that you want because you want to have a interactive experience with your educator or mentor but these are really basic types of things that could be learned and understood and found the solution to by simply doing a little bit of the legwork yourself with that said i'm going to give you one example here and just kind of like walk it out for you assuming you had ten thousand dollars in your trading index futures and you are using this trade idea that i'm outlining here that i was monitoring in the afternoon session ten thousand dollars is equity you want to take one percent risk per trade so you're gonna take that ten thousand dollars times it by point zero one that's going to give you a figure of one hundred that's one hundred dollars that's what one percent of ten thousand dollars is that means that's the total amount of risk that you're willing to assume we determined from the hypothetical entry of your demo account at 37.54 and three quarters and a stop at 45 and three quarters that's nine points or nine handles okay that's what that nine is so we're taking the dollar amount which is the one percent of our equity giving us hundred dollars or one percent of ten thousand dollars total movement that we're willing to absorb as a risk or a stop loss is nine points so we take nine divide that into one hundred that gives us eleven okay 11 times we can get the figure 9. that 11 if we're going to trade a mini or e-mini futures contract on the s p the multiplier per contract is 50 bucks so divide 50 into 11. you can't so you right away you know you can't trade a mini if you're gonna be risking one percent so you have to drop down into the micros so now we have 11 with a multiple of five so micro lot on e-mini micro instead of fifty dollars per point it's five dollars per point so how many fives can you go into 11 with it two so you can do two micro lots now this might not be for you because when i do risk management i don't really factor in commissions i'll just do the math like this so you might look at that and say well what about commissions that might not allow me to do one percent if you're going to be very hard-lined about the risk management and i get it some of you should be like that in the beginning but as you get more experience you'll start thinking oh you know the covered costs of commissions and such over time it's fine i'll work that out but for risk management just for the entry to stop loss not factoring commission costs and fees with your broker or spread okay all those ideas need to be considered but we're going to assume that they're not going to be considered for this example you have to figure that out on your own if that's how you're going to do your risk management but for me i don't ever factor in the cost because costs are always going to be they're like taxes you can't avoid them so just you eat it okay so you can do two micro lots at five dollars per point making profit or taking in drawdown or loss per point fluctuation so if we're buying at 37.54 in three quarters and we're risking nine points how much money is that ninety dollars risk so we're under one percent so we're not even risking a full one percent our target is 25 and a half points or 255 dollars because two micro at five dollars at the multiplier of each point two times five is ten so you're making 10 dollars per point because you're holding 2 micros so 25 and a half points here at 10 total multiplier based on the two micro lots which would be basically two and a quarter percent return so you're gonna risk one percent to make two and a quarter percent on one intraday scalp here and then you have another one here and if you were trying to do shorts over here you could have done something equivalent to that as well so it's not hard to make one to three to five percent in one day with intraday price swings the problem is you're going to get over excited and think that you can do every single fluctuation in price action and these types of movements while they're exciting when you do the math on them and you see the potential a lot of times people say well one percent i can't make money with one percent man you can make a lot of money with one percent okay if you if you can make one percent a day that's enormous because that compounds over time and it's not a matter of saying well if i make one percent a day and i do that monday through friday that means i need five percent of the end of the week or 20 for the month correct that's what most of you are probably thinking right now when in fact you're actually able to get 22 a month because of the effects of compounding if you do one percent per day trading monday through friday four weeks average per month one could make 22 percent a month now 22 percent a month is phenomenal like that's ridiculous rates of return professional money managers and fund managers don't try to do that for a whole year some of them do anywhere between 12 to 15 percent a year and they call that an ex stellar year and if they make 20 or more you know that's a blockbuster year and their parade around in front of their clients thing exceed that type of return and bolster their confidence to put more money in that's usually when they'll say hey you want to allocate more money because they get paid to do that well one percent is in my opinion obviously you know it's not going to be the case for a new student or a new trader but my opinion one percent every single day is unrealistic but for a seasoned trader one percent average per day is really easy but you're gonna have to get the experience to do that and again that also equates to the average of one percent so in other words if i have one trade a week and i make five percent that's equivalent to one percent a day for the week i'm not going to sit in front of the charts to try to make one percent each day it's it's not reasonable for me i have things i have to take care of i have businesses to run and family to tend to and i can find setups that i can frame and make you know five percent on one set up or first partial of a trade so it's a matter how you're gonna form fit this for yourself okay and obviously the best scenario would be if you're going to be eventually getting to the point where you can risk two percent you can do this framework for one limit order to be buying at 37 54 and three quarters use to stop as explained here and do a second order the same way but don't use this as your profit objective use this short term high here or the target i was outlining 3805 and a half and then you would be able to get a run from here to here on one that would close out and then the second one would hopefully run up in here and get the daily range and you can do obviously better than you need two and a quarter percent just on this one you'd have two and a quarter twice because the one that you bought down i'm sorry the one you bought here they got out here that's your banked two and a quarter percent hypothetically then the second one would be running here and then rolling through that level up to here so you could be making as much as four and a half percent more on the second position so what are you really making six and three quarter percent one day two orders one trade and a lot of you guys are trying to do those funded account challenges and they give you like you got to make 10 to do this and that if you learn how to trade and you learn what i'm teaching you folks listen those numbers are achievable but you have to know what you're doing and also how to weather drawdown drawdown would be having your account reduced from either its starting balance or after you've made equity increases you start taking losses that's drawdown well that drawdown has to be managed so if you have a trade and for instance say you took this hypothetical trade here with one order and you got in at that 37 54 and three quarters and you got stopped out down here okay you would have taken less than one percent loss so your next trade you should do half of one percent why because number one you have emotions psychological impact of taking a loss you're going to be most likely wanting to have revenge and you're probably going to want to do more leverage than you should and you're probably going to want to get it faster than you should in other words being patient is not going to be the right thing for you you're going to feel like impatience is eating at you so therefore you have to get right back in there and try to get your money back and that is a loser's cycle gambler's mentality so by reducing the risk on your next trade once you take a loss then you have to make back fifty percent of what you lost so in this case if you would have got stopped down here we'll just round it to a hundred dollars with commission you have to make fifty dollars back before you can go back to your full one percent risk and that's it's easy that's easy to do it's not easy to follow this logic so what happens if you take that second trade and risking a half of one percent and that trade gets knocked out to a loss what size you use on your next trade one quarter of one percent and that's obviously the lowest you can go with so you have to determine what your risk is and it's going to obviously reduce the number of trades you can take that's why i tell everyone you know there's a lot of you out here that are starting on a shoestring meaning you don't have a lot of money and you're trying to speculate with live funds with a fifty dollar account or a hundred dollar account and i get it i understand it's hard if you don't come for money if you don't have the resources where you are you know globally it feels like you're out of reach learn the skill set okay i promise you if you learn the skill set you can do funded account type things as a venture or find partners that'll come in with you you don't need the money it doesn't have to be your money you can make a lot of money with other people's money but funded accounts provide a way for you to go in with a very small amount of money and you learn the skills that i'm laying down here in public you can walk right into anyone's funded account challenges okay if you want to call it a challenge and just walk right through it and take it over and then secure whatever size account you're trying to go for and then trade it soberly you aim for 10 a month 15 a month and just make that and stop don't try to push it don't try to get rich real quick you want that 10 to 15 a month coming into your hands after the split that you do with whatever that account is when you're registered with whatever funded account company that's helping you find the scratch to get started but knowing how to manage that drawdown will keep you from going into obviously blowing your account it'll control the equity drawdown it won't be a sharp jagged falling off a cliff it'll be you run up to new equity highs and you have a losing trade which is reasonable everybody has a losing trade you might have a series of losing trades but if you take a one percent loss and then you take another loss at half of one percent you take another loss at a quarter of one percent you're only down one and three quarters percent that's not a lot of drawdown but you've now taken three losing consecutive trades that's easy to come back from versus taking one percent loss then saying okay i'm gonna double up and try to make it back with two percent risk because i don't have to just get half the position movement i took as a loss and then you take a full two percent loss now you're down three percent on two trades then you go and again thinking well i'm gonna do it again with two percent or worse you go higher risking three percent or four percent and then you don't use a stop or you move your stop opening it up with more risk and then suddenly it's very easy to fall into ten percent draw down and then it becomes a psychological wrestling match where now you feel embarrassed you're shamed you feel like you have to have it back otherwise you're a failure when professional money managers they don't care about being in drawdown they care about managing their expectations and the discipline that's required to operate and engage they are not allowed to touch their account when they're highly charged or emotional so that's all part of risk management it's not just the numbers game it's a psychological game too but you have to manage that and quell that whole desire to get right back to where you were before you took that loss that feeling comes because you are an infant in this industry and that's not a knock against you okay it's the truth if you were working with me one-on-one and i was standing in the same room with you i would say it to your face you're an infant if you think like that it's infantile to think that way it's not a rude comment it's the facts because you want to get your toy that was taken from you back right away and you don't need it back right away when you have a loss or if you go through drawdown the professional money management views it as it's a loan that you're going to collect interest on when a bank lends out money is it crying about how it had to give out your down payment for a home or your boat loan or some other purchase that you made a loan with them with are you are they upset about giving you that big lump of money no no are they expecting to get it back right away no no in fact they don't want you to take it and pay it off real quick because that's their business model they want to lend out the money and get as much interest as possible so while we don't want to leave drawdown in long periods out there we look at or at least i look at when i take a loss if i go into drawdown it's just alone i know i know i'm going to get interest on it because my career isn't going to be framed by the last five trades or the last five weeks or the last five months or last five years i have a long-term view and that's the problem with being an infant in this industry it's too easy for you to want to quit because you don't see past what's happened to you right now or what happened to you last week or the last trade and that last trade that one singular event you've made such a monumental experience out of and it's make it or break it every single trade is a make it or break it i've read two people one on twitter and one on the comment section of the videos i have and they're basically saying yeah i think i'm packing in i can't do this and if that's true congratulations you you found where your breaking point is and you're not willing to go any further into that and if you know yourself well godspeed but there's a lot of folks that get frustrated and if you're going to quit you're not going to post it on the internet you're not okay i believe these individuals that do that they just want to be encouraged like don't don't stop me that's it's a cry for help because honestly if i would have had that as a medium when i was coming up i would have went on the internet and said help i'm gonna quit somebody stopped me from quitting i'm gonna walk out the door it's kind of like a relationship when your lady wants to leave she's like i'm leaving you and she really doesn't want to leave she just wants to see what your reaction is going to be as you see her walking towards the door or grabbing a couple things of her clothing if she's going to leave she ain't telling you you're going to come home and her stuff is gone and if you're going to quit this industry you're not going to talk about it you just ain't going to be here anymore so again roll your sleeves up just understand this is what it's like to be a trader you're going to be in periods where it's very difficult and no matter what you do what you follow what i taught you what somebody else taught you whatever worked in the past you are going to encounter losing trades plural you're going to do it wrong you're going to have an expectation in the marketplace it isn't going to pan out like you thought guess what that means you may take a monetary loss and that's a tax on success you have to pay it nobody gets around that nobody gets around it and some of you in here for whatever reason think that you're going to stroll right on in here because you're going to be the exception to the rule and guess what folks i'm promising you you aren't that special if i wasn't that special nobody's exempt from it you all we all every single speculator has to pay their toll and occasionally guess what the ferryman's got his bony hand holding out waiting for you to drop whatever the next sacrifice of your losing trades gonna be and you have control of how bad that's going to be you limit it but you have to do the math and stick to it otherwise if you trade willy-nilly whatever happens i don't really use a hard stop but i know when i want to get out i hate hearing traders say that that's so disappointing to hear because really what that is communicating is you really don't have it together if you don't know where to place a stop loss you really don't know what you're doing you don't so with this model i've removed that guess that mystery your hard stop needs to be placed period if it gets hit it's done you a favor period but if it does you that favor of protecting and limiting risk it's your job as the trader to listen to the analyst next trade it provides you'll have to manage the trade with less risk because you have a task now you have to come out of drawdown no matter what the drawdown is you have to come back incrementally so let's assume you do a two percent risk trade and you lose the full two percent your next trade you could only risk one percent and it would be basically what i'm showing you here with one contract or one limit order not contract it would be the equivalent of if you're doing two percent you would be doing basically four micro lots entering at 37 54 and three quarters hypothetical entry on the demo and your stop loss at 37 45 and three quarters nine points risk across four micro lots twenty dollars per point okay so if you take that full loss at two percent your next trade you can only do what's being shown here one percent risk and you've got to determine where is your trade defined in terms of points or pips if it's 4x how much of a stop loss do you need in this case we're using this factor here okay nine that's the number of points that's required for the stop for this particular trade not every trade is going to require a static nine point stop sometimes you can do a stop you know with five points it's hard i'm not suggesting that you should be trying to do that but other trades are going to require you to do what more than nine might be 10 might be 12 points so you have to consider what that's going to do for you in terms of risk management and eventually you may get to the point where you lose so much in drawdown that you really can't technically do one micro even if you have the margin to cover it so that's why it's important for you to be very diligent about managing your risk and controlling drawdown don't think oh well you know i'm gonna start off with one percent and then once you make a trade and it's easy think well i can do three percent because if i can do three percent risk and i get a multiple of five r hmm i can make 15 one trade and what if i do that every day even better what if i do that in the morning session and in the afternoon and if i can do that why not lose sleep and trade london too well that's 45 in one day good grief i could probably quit my job next sunday i did that kind of stuff folks it doesn't work like that doesn't work like that at all so you have to use low threshold objectives and work your way up from that your career is not going to be 10 trades and you made it no longevity controlled risk impeccable risk management that's how you get here that's how you arrive at consistently profitable and losing trades don't mean anything despite anybody watching you if you do it publicly a losing trade is nothing but a tax on success that's it all right stop management this is going to close the mentorship in terms of the teachings and past this video i'll be doing obviously reviews and topical studies when i feel led to do so but as far as the model itself and the mentorship okay for youtube this free series i did this is done and you'll have everything that you need here every i'm confident in saying that what has been provided to you after this discussion here you have enough and obviously the things i taught you on youtube channel and other lessons and maybe other future lessons i make do they'll just be amplifications and help you refine what this has already given you freely but stop management okay when you place your stop loss down here when can you and when do i move my stop-loss well you have to determine where you're getting in at and where you're trying to get as a target so that's your range from 37 54 and three-quarters to 37 80 and a quarter so technically 25 and a half points okay so what is that 12 and three quarters points something like that let's round it to 12 and a half points if we see price move 12 and a half half points above the entry point that you entered at if it moves twelve and a half points your stop loss can move 25 percent up from where what's 25 of what range where your stop loss is and your entry so split that range in terms of points if this goes up 12 and a half points which would be 50 of the expected range then your stop loss can be reduced or trimmed down to 25 so it's going to give you that little bit of a cookie that feel good moment you trimmed some of the risk you're not jamming it up up above to break even because you're going to worry about it you're just moving a little bit now when price moves to 75 percent of the expected targeted range and it means from your entry to here if it moves 75 of that then the stop goes to break even period there's your systematic movement of your stop-loss you're not jamming it to break even you're not gonna be worried about getting stopped out you're gonna be more likely to be watching does it still keep reaching for your objective do down closed candles keep supporting price does it run below short-term loan and run higher with a lot of energy because it took short-term sales stops out is it dropping down to a fair value gap and re-accumulating and sending another higher price leg higher that's what you're watching that's the things that you're looking for and as long as it's doing those things collectively or individually you are one side that means you're on the right side of the market and keep holding for your position to hit target if you are doing multiple positions say you're doing competition level leverage and for me that's anywhere between the range of three percent to four and a half percent then you're going to be looking to take partials okay and that partial might be you know once it goes 20 points in your favor you have a static number it always hits 15 or 20. once it does that you no matter what you're doing you take something off okay that's something you might want to incorporate in your own trading model as well but that part is for you to determine don't let me give you static rules that are considered you know cast in stone ironclad can't change it you know i hate doing it with my students because it takes away the uniqueness the individualism that you're bringing as the trader to your own model so these are just basic foundational points that i think will serve you well but you're going to obviously evolve and come up with better ways that meet your expectations and also fit your personality okay so i think that's going to be it and i absolutely want to congratulate all of you that if you've gone through every single one of these videos if you've done the work and back testing and looking at things and studying and you're convinced that the pattern's really there kudos to you okay for those that have not got it yet my encouragement is for you to keep doing it and i promise it won't take you long in fact if you just started and you just found this channel i promise you if you give it six months you'll see things that you never saw before but at the end of one full year because it might take some of you to do that you'll have it you'll understand what you're looking for doesn't mean you're going to be trading every single day it doesn't mean you're going to know the bias every single day doesn't mean you're not going to have losing trades it means that you're going to know what you're doing and even though you may have short term hardships with being stopped out or missing moves or reading it wrong you still will have enough faith in this model because you know it will repeat in the future more times than it fails and i'm challenging you to determine whether that statement is true or not until next time good luck and good trade
