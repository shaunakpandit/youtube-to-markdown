# YouTube Channel Prep: Mindset and Mentorship (A Detailed Breakdown)

**Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kt6V4ai60fI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kt6V4ai60fI)

## Introduction: Setting the Stage for the Upcoming Mentorship

Alright folks, how you doing? Hope everybody's doing well. This video serves as a prep to get your mindset correct about what's coming in two days on the YouTube channel. I want you to understand going forward what to expect.

## The "Demo Baller" Moniker and Addressing Concerns

*   You are familiar with my moniker: I've dubbed myself **the Demo Baller**.
*   I've always traded and taught through a demo account for my own protection.
*   Some students have questioned whether my strategies work in live accounts.
    *   This is usually because they can't make it work in demo or paper trading due to:
        *   Inability to commit to the required process and development time.
        *   Rushing and disregarding instructions given during mentoring.
*   A small faction on the internet believes my teachings don't work in live accounts.
*   I've never been interested in forcing people to believe me.
*   Instead, I challenge everyone to test my teachings:
    *   Do they hold up in the marketplace?
    *   Do they provide consistent results over a week (not perfection every day)?

## Teaching Philosophy: Focusing on the "Yearners"

*   I'm teaching to those who are yearning to learn how to trade.
    *   Those who haven't started or have tried and failed.
*   Some viewers may already be consistent or successful traders, and I'm thankful for that.
*   This mentorship is specifically designed *for my daughter*.
    *   I'm aiming to kill two birds with one stone.
    *   To show a simplistic way to use my teachings.
    *   Stripping the model down to its core elements: no bells and whistles, no advanced theories.
    *   Providing a model that is easy to understand.
        *   Helping decide when to act
        *   Knowing when *not* to act.

## Avoiding Analysis Paralysis: Simplicity Over Complexity

*   Some viewers may want an arsenal of "high-tech weaponry."
*   My experience:
    *   Advanced analysis concepts can create exceptional traders in mentorship.
    *   However, the *majority* of students get bogged down.
    *   This leads to analysis paralysis, with too many decisions to make.
    *   Like a kid in a candy store: what to choose first, and then what's next?
*   **Discipline is crucial**: it's a personal responsibility.
    *   I can provide the tools, but you must respect their potential for harm if misused.
    *   Using live ammunition before proper training can be dangerous.

## The Stripped-Down Mentorship Model

*   I'll be teaching a stripped-down version of my concepts in a mentorship style.
    *   The goal is to guide you through a specific trading model.
    *   Staying focused on that model, avoiding unnecessary diversions.
*   One approach is to trade index futures.
    *   If you're not interested in futures, these concepts can also be applied to Forex.
*   I began trading in 1992 as a commodities and futures trader.
    *   I moved from grains, cattle, gold, silver, crude oil to the bond market (30-year Treasury bond) and the S&P.
    *   I became a better intraday trader, abandoning the pursuit of long-term position trading.
    *   Position trading didn't work for me due to my work schedule.
    *   Short-term intraday trading made more sense for my lifestyle.
*   My trading style might not be yours.
*   I'll teach how to scale these concepts to any timeframe.
    *   No excuses for not improving your understanding of price action.

## Promises and Expectations: A Realistic Approach

*   Here are my promises to you:
    *   You will learn repeating patterns.
    *   You *won't* be perfect; perfection isn't my goal.
    *   My goal is to improve your understanding of:
        *   Price action
        *   How price is delivered
        *   How to read the bias on an intraday and daily basis
    *   You'll find setups that repeat with similar characteristics.
        *   They won't be identical, but you'll recognize the similarities.
        *   Knowing and trusting that this is a familiar setup.
*   You are all viewed as "yearners" wanting to learn how to trade.
*   There are **three stages** in this YouTube mentorship:
    1.  **Yearning (Greenhorns):** You're just starting out and eager to learn.
    2.  **Learning:** You're going through a process of becoming structured learners
    3.  **Earning:** At your discretion and timing, you'll become an earner.
*   Many who start this mentorship will not complete it.
    *   Frustration arises when wanting something else or an alternative teaching method.
    *   I will not take suggestions on how to teach differently. This is the way I'm going to teach it, as is.
    *   No specific trade setups will be given.
    *   I'll draw out areas on the chart *beforehand* where I want you to study price action.
    *   It's your job to study these areas using the concepts I teach.
    *   *Do not* view these as trade setups or enticements to take live trades.
*   This mentorship won't last a full year, probably three or four months.
*   I *will not* be providing content to the YouTube channel or my personal mentorship during **March 2022**.
    *   I will be on vacation and taking road trips.
    *   I will not be working for you during this time.
*   If you can accept this, the coming months should be entertaining and interesting for you as a student.

## Demo Account vs. Live Account: Transparency and Independence

*   I promised in 2022 to show how these concepts work outside of a demo account.
*   I've used the "Demo Baller" moniker to champion the idea of teaching through a demo.
    *   If I can teach through a demo and things repeat, you can see the patterns on your charts (live or demo).
    *   If you've been in my presence when I call out moves beforehand, it's rewarding.
    *   You on YouTube will have those experiences, too.
*   *Don't* become dependent on me pointing everything out beforehand.
    *   This will stunt your growth and create a codependency.
*   I foster an independent mindset where you make decisions on your own.
    *   The results are yours: you own both success and failure.
    *   I can't co-sign for your failures.
*   Some of you *will* fail.
    *   I've said this many times openly.
    *   I started a paid mentorship in 2016, and some students are *still* struggling.
    *   Others from 2016 have had mind-blowing results.
    *   Traders from my final mentorship class in 2021 are also doing well.
    *   It's not a shortcoming in the teaching; it's a unique individual experience.
    *   I can't speed up the process any more than I already have.
*   I'm optimistic but also realistic.
*   Some of you won't do what I ask.
    *   You'll try to shortcut things, thinking you don't need to do certain steps.
    *   Your results will suffer because of this.
*   If I suggest drills, homework, or studies, do your best to participate.
    *   Even if you can't participate live, review it later.
    *   Some have businesses, school, jobs, or family commitments.
    *   I won't jump through hoops to make it feasible for everyone.
    *   It's unrealistic to expect that of me.
    *   I love doing this and look forward to it, but I want you to have the right mindset.

## Choosing the Right Platform: TradingView and TD Ameritrade

*   In 2022, you'll see how these concepts work outside of a demo account.
*   This *doesn't* mean MT4.
    *   Years ago, it was shown how MT4 could be used to fraudulently fake profitability.
    *   I've proven I don't do that.
*   I switched to **TradingView** (the community's preferred platform).
    *   I teach my mentorship students through TradingView.
    *   If it's not your preferred platform, you'll have to get used to it.
    *   I won't be doing anything in addition to it.
*   For a *live* account, I chose **TD Ameritrade**.
    *   It's reputable and regulated by the CFTC and other governing bodies.
    *   I can't rig it to make myself look smarter.
    *   I can't go back and change or fix trades.
    *   Trades are either profitable or not.
*   TD Ameritrade uses industry-standard margins.
    *   If you can't trade a market due to margin requirements, don't let that hinder you.
    *   I'll show you how to work around that on other platforms.
*   I don't personally use MT4 for teaching or live trading.
*   I'm confident students can still use MT4, MT5, or other platforms.
*   As an educator, I moved away from those platforms because they can be gamed (used for fraud).
*   You've seen examples of me recording entries and calling moves in real-time without using replay.
    *   Replay doesn't allow for trade entries.
    *   Replay only shows completed candlesticks, not the price action within each candlestick.
*   I've been asked to show a live account for years.
*   I hesitated because seeing others' results could be discouraging.
    *   As a developing trader in the 1990s, seeing high profits made me feel like I'd never achieve it.
    *   I also didn't want to give low-end results that wouldn't inspire interest.

## Trading is Personal: Embrace the Journey

*   This business is extremely unique and personal.
*   It's both the easiest and most impossible thing to be successful at. (Oxymoron)
*   You can't appreciate the difficulty until you trade with live funds.
*   In the demo stage, you feel invincible.
*   Something changes when you trade with a live account:
    *   Every tick matters because it represents success or failure.
    *   Losing in a demo account is insignificant compared to live trading losses.
    *   Making money can be worse than losing because it can lead to overtrading and overleveraging.
*   We'll discuss how to avoid these issues in the YouTube mentorship.
*   You must take ownership and responsibility for your actions.
*   If you do well, you earned it; if you don't, you must accept it.
*   Many people are too weak-minded to become successful traders, regardless of who teaches them.
*   That's just the way it is.
*   There's no magical formula or secret that guarantees success.


# Addressing Personal Challenges and Demonstrating Live Account Results

## Overcoming Personal Hurdles to Achieve Trading Success

*   I acknowledge my personal challenges:
    *   Obsessive-compulsive tendencies
    *   ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder)
    *   Bipolar disorder
*   Despite these mental barriers, I've been able to develop a repeatable trading idea that works at least once a week.
*   I believe individuals with similar or fewer challenges can also achieve success.
*   This belief is based on case studies of my own students.
*   Trading is a transferable skill that requires honing by the individual student.

## Fulfilling the Promise: Live Account Demonstration in 2022

*   I promised to show trading results outside of a demo account in 2022.
*   I'm using **TD Ameritrade** to fulfill this promise.
*   Years ago, I was asked to showcase a regulated, non-MT4 broker.
*   TD Ameritrade was chosen as a better option than standard Forex brokers for the following reasons:
    *   It allows trading in Forex, futures, commodities, stocks, options, and bonds.
    *   Having access to diverse asset classes is beneficial for profitability, as some assets perform better at certain times of the year.
*   **Disclaimer:** I am not endorsing TD Ameritrade, nor am I an introducing broker. I do not receive any compensation from them.
*   I'm simply disclosing the broker where I deposited funds for demonstrating non-demo account results.
*   I'm not advising anyone to trade there.
*   My experience with TD Ameritrade:
    *   Immediate trade fills
    *   Solid confirmations
    *   No technical issues
*   The only challenge is adjusting to the platform's layout and features.
    *   Transitioning from MT4 to TradingView was also initially cumbersome.
    *   I'm still adapting to TD Ameritrade's interface.
*   The key takeaway: If you know how to trade, the trades themselves are easy, regardless of the platform.
*   I maintain a simple approach, using limit and market orders, and closing trades at desired targets.

## Live Account Performance: A Realistic Perspective

*   The purpose is to demonstrate the applicability of my concepts in both demo and live environments.
*   The same trading logic applies in both scenarios.
*   The account balance is $23,694.11.
    *   This is not a substantial amount and is not meant to be bragged about.
    *   However, it is a *real* account balance and not a demo account.
    *   The balance is expected to grow over time.
*   My objective is to teach a conceptual, hypothetical income-based strategy.
    *   The goal isn't to win a "World Cup" of trading or outperform every Instagram trader.
    *   The aim is to inspire others to attempt trading and potentially supplement their income.
*   I believe that challenging financial times are ahead.
*   My goal is to equip individuals with the skills to navigate these challenges.

## E-mini S&P 500 Examples and Forgiving Entries

*   The examples shown use the **E-mini S&P 500 March 2022 delivery contract**.
*   The chart timeframe is two minutes.
*   Trades Illustrated
    *   Showing a short entry and its cover point.
    *   Highlights included a small scalp and another short position.
    *   Indicates no other trades occurred after those initial short positions.
    *   Another trade illustrated on the two minute chart involved a forgiving entry strategy.
*   A setup from the mentorship is used as an example: entry and exit points are shown.
    *   Limited "handles" (price movement increments) were captured.
    *   One "handle" equals four ticks, or $50 in this market.
    *   Each tick is worth $12.50.
*   The target was buy stops above a high point.
*   The strategy is very simple, focusing on optimal trade entry (OTE).
*   I'll teach "forgiving entries," where precise entry points aren't critical.
*   Precision is more important in determining the directional bias and price targets.
*   The mentorship will focus on identifying where the price is "reaching for."
*   If you can conceptually understand the setups, you'll find more opportunities than you can imagine, even on lower timeframes.

## Scalability, Micro Accounts, and CFDs

*   If you can learn to capture 25 handles in the E-mini S&P 500 market:
    *   You may not need the $12,000-$13,000 margin required to trade one contract.
    *   You can trade micro contracts, which require less initial margin.
    *   While you'll make less per handle ($5 instead of $50 on the E-mini S&P 500), you can still gradually build up capital.
*   Outside the U.S., you can trade CFDs (Contracts for Difference) on the US500 market through MT4 accounts.
*   **Disclaimer:** I'm not suggesting U.S. residents trade CFDs, as it's illegal due to regulatory requirements.
*   U.S. traders must trade through regulated exchanges like the futures market.
*   Futures markets offer micro accounts for instruments like the E-mini S&P 500 and Nasdaq.
    *   These accounts have reduced margin and tick values compared to standard mini contracts.
*   I'll cover all these concepts in a simplified manner.
    *   The goal is to avoid complex systems with numerous moving parts.
    *   Focus on simple, logical, and visually understandable elements.

## Chart Simplicity and the Liquidity Matrix

*   The charts will be kept simple, avoiding distracting elements.
*   Key elements:
    *   Lines highlighting levels for breakouts
    *   Lines highlighting reach points
*   The basis is understanding how markets work within a **liquidity matrix**:
    *   Buy-side liquidity
    *   Sell-side liquidity
*   I'll teach these concepts in the mentorship.
*   You'll be able to identify repeating setups.
*   Aim for one good setup per week.
*   If you can capture 25 handles per week in the E-mini market, you can be very successful.
    *   You don't need to achieve "home run" trades.

## Inspiration and Mindset: Covering Expenses Through Trading

*   **Inspiration:**
    *   Imagine your mortgage or rent is $1,500.
    *   What if you could earn 50% or 100% of that amount through trading each month?
*   The goal is to cultivate that mindset.
    *   Or, consider your car payment and insurance.
    *   What if you could cover those expenses through your own trading efforts over time?
*   I'm not suggesting everyone will achieve this immediately.
*   However, if you commit to the process I outline, I believe it's possible.
*   The things I'll show you are things you'll be able to spot on your own.

## Coaching and Independent Learning

*   I'll coach you in the coming months, highlighting potential delivery points.
*   I don't want you to become dependent on my guidance.
*   I'll teach you how to anticipate market movements independently.
*   You can then check your analysis against my insights or reviews.
*   My belief is that you'll become better at reading price action after this YouTube mentorship.

## Mentorship Schedule and Resources

*   The mentorship will last approximately four months, including the month of March 2022.
    *   I will be on vacation and will not be uploading content or providing mentorship during March.
    *   I will resume mentorship activities in April.
*   **Schedule:**
    *   The first episode will be on Friday.
    *   Subsequent uploads will be on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
*   Assignments and PDF files will be provided throughout the week.
*   Resources will be accessible through my community tab.
*   If you commit to the process, you'll improve your ability to read price action and anticipate market movements.
*   Trading will become less challenging with sound logic, a good mentor, and a simplified approach.
*   Be safe, and I'll talk to you on Friday.

# **Mentorship Program: Elements of a Trade Setup**

## **Introduction**

*   **Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmeCWULSTHc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmeCWULSTHc)
*   This is the first teaching video in the mentorship program.
*   **Recommendation:** Watch the introductory video on the YouTube channel playlist to understand the expectations and contrast between expectations and what will be delivered.

## **Overview**

*   The mentorship focuses on **Futures index trading**, primarily **paper trading on TradingView.com.**
*   **Live Data:** The video displays live executions from Thinkorswim to provide a real-world comparison. The presenter will demonstrate live trades that were made for the trading day.
*   Emphasis is placed on comparing and contrasting the live trades with the content available on YouTube and other educational platforms.

## **Market Focus: Nasdaq E-mini Futures**

*   The primary focus is on **intraday price action** for **Nasdaq E-mini Futures.**
*   The presenter believes this market is valuable for study and can be applied to other markets, including:
    *   E-mini S&P
    *   E-mini Dow
*   The **E-mini NASDAQ** is described as **faster** and **more aggressive.**

## **Trading Philosophy**

*   The goal is to understand what price action is **likely to do before it happens.**
*   This is NOT a promise of immediate success, but rather a demonstration of how the presenter trades versus how the mentorship will teach specific setups in a demo account.
*   **Important:** The mentorship is **not intended to encourage trading with live funds.**
*   Teachings will primarily use **TradingView.com** paper trading module or **hindsight data.**

## **Analysis of Live Trades (One-Minute Chart)**

*   The video analyzes live executions from the trading day, emphasizing potential learning opportunities.
*   Transactions are indicated by bubbles on the screen which include:
    *   Reversals (trades on long are reversed to the other direction)
    *   Long Entries
    *   Short Entries
    *   Cover

## **Risk Management and Expectations**

*   The presenter encourages consideration of the consistency and number of "**handles**" (full handle moves) in an index Futures contract that would be satisfactory.
*   **Handle Definition:** The minimum fluctuation in these markets (four ticks).
*   **Examples:**
    *   **E-mini S&P:** 1 handle = 4 ticks = $50
    *   **Nasdaq:** 1 handle = $20

## **Market Selection and Margin Considerations**

*   Discussion of the characteristics of different markets:
    *   Nasdaq: Faster, more aggressive, but can also be lethargic.
    *   S&P
    *   Dow (YM): Some students prefer trading the YM.
*   **Margin Requirements:**
    *   Nasdaq Futures (full contract): ~$177,000 (typically)
    *   E-mini S&P Futures (full contract): ~$12,500 (typically)
*   **Micro Contracts:** Trading micro contracts reduces the tick multiplier but allows participation with less capital.

## **Transparency and Authenticity**

*   The presenter aims to be transparent about his trading versus the promises made in the mentorship.
*   He contrasts his approach with others on YouTube who may exaggerate results.
*   The Thinkorswim chart is recognizable to those familiar with the platform.
*   Results and reflections are posted on the community tab of the channel.
*   **Community Tab:** Subscribe and enable "all notifications" (bell icon) to receive updates.

## **Trade Examples and Key Concepts**

*   Analysis of specific trades is discussed.
    *   Long at 720, Exit at 732 (12 handles)
    *   Long at 756, Exit at 784 (A2 handles)
    *   Short at 798, Cover at 675 (Significant handles)

*   The presenter asks viewers to consider which trade setup they would like to learn.
*   The mentorship focuses on providing a framework (foundation to a trading model) for finding similar setups.
*   **Goal:** To enable independent trading without reliance on black-box systems or signal services.

## **Independence and Chart Analysis**

*   The presenter emphasizes the importance of **independent thinking** and being **unshackled** from restrictive systems.
*   The chart displayed is clean and free from excessive indicators.
*   The goal is not to hunt for small, three-to-five handle trades, although those can be profitable for algorithmic trading.
*   The focus is on finding larger price swings and developing the skills to identify them.
*   The presenter is NOT teaching the buy/sell short/buy/sell short strategy that he uses.

## **TradingView Analysis: Weekly Chart**

*   The video transitions to analyzing the NASDAQ futures March delivery contract (NQH22) on TradingView.
*   **Symbol:** NQH22
*   **Timeframe:** Weekly chart
*   **Recommendation:** Each week before the new trading week, try to assess whether the next weekly candle is likely to go higher or lower (without predicting the close).
*   Example: Before the current weekly candle opened, the presenter and his students were expecting lower prices based on:
    1.  **Seasonality:** Tendency for the market to decline around this time.
    2.  **Federal Reserve:** Anticipated interest rate hikes (negative for the stock market).
    3.  **Earnings Season:** Increased volatility.
    4.  **Market Tone:** The underlying tone was heavy.

## **"Draw To" Concept**

*   The presenter expected the weekly candle to expand lower and gravitate towards a specific low.
*   The "draw to" concept: Think of price as a paperclip and price levels/seasonality as a magnet, causing price to gravitate towards certain levels.
*   The speed and magnitude of these movements are learned through experience and practice.
*   **Early stages of development:** Focus on the likely direction of the weekly candle.
*   It's acceptable to take one trade based on the weekly bias and then be done for the week, working towards consistency.
*   Avoid trying to trade every session every day, as this can lead to unrealistic expectations and irrational decisions.

## **Daily Chart Analysis: Swing Highs, Swing Lows, and Liquidity**

*   On the **daily chart**, look for **swing highs and swing lows** to identify **liquidity.**
*   The majority of trading and liquidity is found on this time frame.
*   The weekly bias (higher or lower) must be considered when analyzing the daily chart.
*   **Liquidity:** The driving force behind market movement (higher or lower).
*   The market draws to:
    *   **Stops (Liquidity):** Sell stops below old lows and buy stops above old highs.
    *   **Imbalances:** Inefficient price delivery where a single candle moves higher (or lower) without offsetting movement in the opposite direction.
*   The presenter addresses the association with auction theory. The rectangles on the screen does not mean he is just talking about auction theory.


# **Mentorship Program: Deep Dive into a Trade Setup**

## **Unique Market Model**

*   A distinctive market model will be presented, different from traditional supply and demand concepts.
*   This unique model is expected to resonate with many viewers after a couple of weeks of study.

## **Confirmation of Bearish Bias**

*   The presenter confirms a bearish outlook discussed with his paid group.
*   Students are encouraged to verify this claim publicly on their own YouTube channels if it is untrue.
*   **Timeframe Progression:** Analysis will move from the daily chart to the hourly chart.

## **Framework for Weekly Range Analysis (Hourly Chart)**

*   A framework is established to analyze the weekly range on an hourly chart.
*   The framework utilizes:
    *   Monday's opening candle at midnight New York time.
    *   Friday's closing price.
    *   Friday's trading beginning at midnight.

## **Liquidity Pools at Old Daily Lows**

*   A significant sell-off occurred on Thursday, leading to overnight consolidation.
*   The focus is on the old low on the daily chart, acting as a potential "draw to" level due to significant liquidity.
*   **Institutional Perspective:** Large fund traders and institutional investors monitor old lows and highs as key liquidity zones.

## **Transposing Daily Levels to Hourly Chart**

*   Daily levels are transposed onto the hourly chart to provide context.
*   The week has been generally bearish, with prices trending downward.
*   The market forms a short-term high and a short-term low within the consolidation period.

## **Stop Runs and Liquidity Engineering**

*   **Buy Stops:** Resting above short-term highs.
*   **Sell Stops:** Resting below short-term lows.
*   The market initially trades down, taking out sell stops (inducing shorts).
    *   This is interpreted as a "sucker play" to trap traders selling on weakness.
*   The market then reverses, targeting buy stops above the short-term high.

## **Smart Money and Counterparty Dynamics**

*   The algorithm targets buy stop liquidity to find counterparties for smart money.
*   **Mechanism:** Driving the market higher triggers buy stops, creating a surge of buyers at high prices.
*   **Smart Money Strategy:** Smart money uses these buy orders to sell short at a favorable price, facilitating a move lower.
*   **Key Takeaway:** When expecting a significant price move lower, anticipate a potential stop hunt on buy stops or a short-term high being breached. The reverse is generally true when looking for higher prices.
*   Verify this pattern on charts to observe its frequency.

## **Refining Analysis: 15-Minute Timeframe**

*   The timeframe is reduced to 15 minutes to refine analysis.
*   The old low and high levels from the hourly chart are now represented with smaller line segments.
*   **Trendlines:** Used minimally to highlight these levels.
*   The presenter primarily watches a naked chart, free of indicators.
*   **Recommendation for Learners:** Draw these levels on your chart to internalize where liquidity resides.

## **Maintaining Market Awareness**

*   Focus on these levels is crucial to avoid losing perspective amidst the candle formations.
*   These levels act as reference points to maintain orientation.
*   The market initially moved down, removing sell stops and trapping breakout traders going short.
*   The algorithm then returns to an area of cleanly delivered, relatively equal highs.

## **Equal Highs and Retail Trader Behavior**

*   Retail traders often perceive these highs as resistance.
*   Conventional advice suggests placing buy stops above resistance when shorting.
*   While these levels may hold temporarily, they often experience a "stop hunt" event.

## **Anticipating Stop Hunts**

*   Before any significant price move, expect a stop hunt to occur.
*   **Scenario:** Relative equal highs form; the market moves up despite expectations of lower prices.
*   The market is weak, consolidating, and breaks down initially, trapping breakout traders who went short.
*   The market then targets buy stops resting above the highs, placed by those who shorted earlier.

## **Verification and Transparency**

*   It's acknowledged that these concepts can appear easy to explain in hindsight.
*   The presenter reiterates that the initial slides showed actual entries from a live account (Thinkorswim/Charles Schwab).
*   The focus is on the framework for finding the larger trades, not just demo or paper trading.

## **Lower Timeframe Analysis: Two-Minute Chart**

*   Once the conditions above are met, lower timeframes are used to identify specific setups.
*   A two-minute chart is employed (1, 2 or 3 minute charts are ideal for finding imbalances for indices).

## **Clarity of High-Frequency Setups**

*   One, two, and three-minute charts offer excellent clarity for intraday, high-frequency setups.
*   High-frequency trading algorithms often operate on sub-three-minute intervals (seconds to minutes).
*   These algorithms target small imbalances in price action.

## **Break in Market Structure**

*   The market creates a short-term low, then breaks below it, signaling a "break in market structure."
*   **Underlying Premise:** The market is weekly bearish, expecting further downward movement.
*   Liquidity has been engineered through relative equal highs, and the market broke down before running higher.
*   The focus is not on immediately shorting when the market goes above old highs.

## **Identifying a Specific Signature**

*   The key is to look for a specific "signature" that indicates the market's intentions.
*   This pattern is expected to be observed frequently on charts.
*   The market runs stops, creates a short-term low, and then breaks below that low, confirming the break in market structure.

## **The Fair Value Gap (FVG)**

*   After the low is broken, the focus shifts to a specific area: the imbalance, also known as a Fair Value Gap (FVG).
*   The market is expected to move back up into this area, presenting a shorting opportunity.
*   If a short isn't executed there, traders can drop to a one-minute chart to look for a similar setup.
*   Scaling down to lower timeframes is beneficial when the underlying premise supports a move lower.

## **Defining the Fair Value Gap (FVG)**

*   The Fair Value Gap is defined by:
    *   The low of the candle preceding the break.
    *   The high of the candle that follows the break.
*   As price enters this area, the algorithm delivering price is activated.

## **Algorithmic Market Manipulation**

*   The presenter asserts that an algorithm manipulates markets every tick, controlling price action.
*   The perception of buying and selling pressure is challenged.
*   The moves down and then up are interpreted as liquidity engineering, not genuine supply and demand.
*   Recognizing these patterns repeatedly simplifies execution.

## **Backtesting and Skill Development**

*   Resist the impulse to trade live immediately after seeing this setup.
*   Extensive backtesting is necessary to refine skills and address personal trading flaws.
*   Regardless of the trading method, a learning curve exists.
*   This mentorship provides a specific framework and setup.

## **Focus and Pattern Recognition**

*   The presenter emphasizes delivering actionable information.
*   The core concept is identifying the "fingerprints" of this setup.
*   Focus on the imbalance (Fair Value Gap) that forms after the market structure breaks.
*   After a large bearish candle breaks down, the subsequent candle's opening and upward movement into the FVG presents a shorting opportunity.

## **Stop Loss Placement and Risk Management**

*   **Stop Loss Placement:** Above the high of the recent high, or above the high of the prior candle, based on risk tolerance.
*   **Micro vs. Full Contracts:** Micro contracts involve smaller tick multipliers, reducing risk.
*   **Leverage Caution:** Be aware that while discount brokers offer leverage, skills are needed to navigate the market effectively.

## **Alternative Entry Points**

*   If the initial entry point is missed, consider entering short as the price moves lower, near the initial area.
*   Avoid chasing price after a low has been broken, as slippage can create a larger risk.
*   Trusting the short when the market is moving higher is crucial.
*   The goal is to sell short when the candle is moving up, anticipating lower prices.


# **Deepening the Trade Setup: Retail Trader Behavior, Liquidity Matrix, and Algorithmic Insights**

## **Retail Trader Misconceptions**

*   Many retail traders struggle to grasp that market movements often defy conventional logic.
*   They seek confirmation, adhering to textbook principles, leading to late entries.
*   These traders lack a refined understanding of price action and struggle to follow market dynamics.
*   Common mistake: Placing sell stops below the market, anticipating further downward movement.
    *   This works in fast-moving markets but can backfire in consolidating or reversing conditions.

## **Downside Objectives: Introducing the Liquidity Matrix**

*   **Objective:** Defining downside targets after identifying an entry pattern.
*   **The Liquidity Matrix:** A framework for understanding potential price objectives.
*   **Range Definition:**
    *   **High of the Day (Thus Far)**
    *   **Low of the Day (Thus Far)**
*   **Midpoint Calculation:**
    *   Determined using a 50% Fibonacci retracement level.
    *   Fibonacci tool is applied from the high to the low (or vice versa).

## **Premium vs. Discount Markets**

*   **Premium Market:**
    *   Area *above* the 50% Fibonacci level.
    *   Considered "expensive" from an algorithmic perspective.
    *   Markets can remain in a premium for extended periods without entering a discount.
*   **Discount Market:**
    *   Area *below* the 50% Fibonacci level.
    *   When bearish, traders aim to target discount areas.
    *   The algorithm aims to move price from premium to discount.

## **Algorithmic Price Delivery**

*   The algorithm dictates price movement, regardless of buying or selling pressure.
*   Even with substantial buying volume, the algorithm can drive prices lower if in a selling program.
*   Buyers who enter during algorithmic selling are likely to be "crushed" or "squeezed."
*   "Bear squeeze" and "bull squeeze" are simply explanations for not understanding algorithmic behavior.

## **Applying the Liquidity Matrix to the FVG Setup**

*   After identifying a Fair Value Gap (FVG) in a premium market, anticipate a move towards a discount.
*   The market moves from the premium high (specific entry point) to a level below the 50% level of the defined range (day's low and high).

## **Sell Stops and Imbalances as Targets**

*   **Sell Stops:** Located below the day's low within the discount area.
*   Traders who short (sell to enter) must buy back to exit the position.
*   Sell stops represent willing sellers at a relatively low price.

## **Identifying Imbalances Near Lows**

*   The presenter emphasizes the importance of identifying imbalances around the day's low.
*   A single candle passing above the previous candle's high and the next candle's low constitutes an imbalance.
*   This specific instance refers to a *buy-side imbalance.*
*   The algorithm needs to ensure *efficient pricing and booking* by completely rebalancing the imbalance.

## **Efficient Price Delivery**

*   The market moved down and attacked sell stops before completely closing the buy-side imbalance.
*   Candlestick Pattern: The candle *opens and then trades down*, fulfilling its role of balancing the buy-side and sell-side offerings.
*   This represents an *efficiently delivered price move*.

## **Trade Management and Hindsight**

*   The presenter emphasizes the "precision elements" of the trade, from entry to the rebalancing of the imbalance.
*   He admits to exiting the trade after the initial move, missing further potential gains.
*   Acknowledges that it's impossible to be perfect and capitalize on every market move.
*   Urges traders not to dwell on missed opportunities but rather focus on refining their skills.

## **The ATM Machine: Repetitive Precision**

*   The presenter suggests that this pattern provides a high degree of precision and repeats every week.
*   The trade example is the "largest one" from the previous examples.

## **Handle Count and Profit Potential**

*   Using a hypothetical entry at 14,800, the presenter calculates potential profits.
*   Exiting at the top of the range (where the imbalance was closed) yields over 100 handles.

## **Leverage and Risk Management**

*   The presenter discusses the potential for significant profits using 15-25 full futures contracts.
*   Emphasizes the importance of sound money management and skill development before using high leverage.

## **The Importance of Study and Practice**

*   Success requires dedicated study and practice, not just sitting in front of charts.
*   **Backtesting Tools:**
    *   **TradingView Replay Button:** Allows you to observe candle formation, albeit with some limitations.
    *   This is good for studying how price moved and gravitated towards certain levels.
*   You can't practice with entering like that.
*   However, it's the best thing you can have.

## **Focusing on Key Timeframes**

*   The presenter recommends focusing on the period between 8:30 AM and 11:00 AM New York time for index futures.
*   He notes that setups often emerge during this "sweet spot" in the morning.
*   He teaches about this time in his Youtube channel and paid mentorship.
*   He claims he did multiple setups and executions the day of the presentation.

## **Key Elements for Setup Identification**

*   **Run on Liquidity:** Buy stops or sell stops being targeted.
*   **Break in Market Structure:** A short-term low being broken (in a bearish scenario).
*   **Swing Low Formation:**
    *   A candle higher to the left with its low.
    *   The low of the current candle.
    *   The next candle's higher low than the current one.

## **Fair Value Gap (FVG) as a Trigger**

*   After the market breaks below a short-term low, look for the Fair Value Gap (FVG).
*   When the market trades back into the FVG, consider a short entry.
*   Alternative Entry: Use a sell stop order placed within the FVG candle, with the stop loss above the candle's high.

## **Micro Contracts and Risk Mitigation**

*   The presenter notes that micro contracts involve smaller tick multipliers, reducing risk.
*   He notes that full futures leverage is very small with micros.

## **The Power of Repetitive Setups**

*   Finding and studying these repetitive setups allows traders to target larger moves.
*   Sound money management, coupled with this strategy, can be highly profitable.

## **Transparency and Real-World Application**

*   The presenter references his past use of these setups to rapidly grow demo accounts.
*   He emphasizes that the current demonstration is using a *live account* on Thinkorswim/Charles Schwab.
    *   Live accounts are green, while paper trading accounts are orange.

## **Long-Term Vision and Skill Development**

*   The mentorship aims to inspire traders to develop a valuable skill set.
*   This skill could potentially provide an alternative income stream, particularly in challenging economic times.

## **Homework Assignment: Chart Analysis and Backtesting**

*   **Task:** Review e-mini futures contract charts across various timeframes (as specified in the presentation).
*   **Focus Areas:**
    *   Breaks in market structure after liquidity pools (buy stops or sell stops) are taken.
    *   Imbalances in price (Fair Value Gaps).
    *   Weekly expected range: higher or lower prices.
*   **Log and backtest:** The number of handles offered in hindsight examples.
*   **Target Selection:** Aim for the closest target rather than trying to predict the absolute low.

## **Next Steps and Future Lessons**

*   The next lesson will demonstrate how to go back into the charts.
*   It will show how to log information in a journal.
*   It will provide further insights into finding these repeating setups.
*   The next episode will be next Tuesday at 10:00 AM New York local time.

# **ICT Mentorship - January 25, 2022: Internal Range Liquidity and Market Structure Shift**

## **Introduction**

Welcome back! This is the **Tuesday, January 25th, 2022** ICT mentorship on the YouTube channel. Today's topic is **internal range liquidity and market structure shift**. Homework was assigned on the community tab to review a specific chart, analyzing reasons for market structure shifts and buy/sell-side liquidity.

*   **Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQfHZ2DEJ8c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQfHZ2DEJ8c)

*If you haven't completed the homework, pause the video and do so now to avoid cheating yourself out of a learning opportunity.*

## **Chart Analysis: E-Mini Nasdaq 100 Futures (March 2022)**

The chart under consideration is the **15-minute time frame** for the **E-mini Nasdaq 100 futures contract for March 2022** delivery.

*   **Key Areas of Focus:**
    *   **Old Low:** Below this old low, there are sell stops.
    *   **Relative Equal Highs:** Above these equal highs, there are buy stops. *(You could have used the high, but equal highs higher than old highs are preferable.)*

### **Liquidity and Market Movement**

The market trades down, triggering the sell stops below the old low. It then rallies back up, clearing the equal highs, indicating that the buy stops have been taken.

*   **Market Structure Shift Points:**
    *   The old low.
    *   The relative equal highs.

*Anticipate market structure shifts at these points, but don't force them.*

### **Intraday Market Structure Shifts vs. Market Structure Breaks**

Many educators teach market structure "breaks" and "shifts" interchangeably. However, for intraday trading, it's crucial to focus on **intraday market structure shifts**. A break in a bearish market structure to the downside intraday might only lead to an intraday price leg and a same-day high being taken out.

*   **Market Structure Shift:** Suggests a likely upside or downside draw intraday.
*   **Market Structure Break:** Carries more weight and implies a prolonged, multi-day movement.

*There is some semantics here.*

### **Anticipating Bearish Market Structure Shifts**

After a fake run above the equal highs, how do you know if a bearish market structure shift is imminent? The key is to look for **evidence**.

*Forget everything else taught about market structure breaks and shifts. This lesson presents the algorithmic perspective of intraday market structure shifts.*

*   **Key Price Levels:** Keep in mind the approximate price levels of **14,600** and **14,820**.

## **Drilling Down: Two-Minute Chart Analysis**

Let's examine the same day on a **two-minute chart**, focusing on the equal highs and the initial run downwards. Remember the price points of **14,600** and **14,860**.

### **Stripping Away Preconceived Notions**

Without the levels on the chart, it's easy to get lost in the "noise." The uninitiated often bring preconceived notions about markets, technical analysis, or price action. Strip those away and imagine you're seeing price action for the first time. *No order blocks, breakers, supply/demand, Elliott Wave, or any of that stuff.*

### **Algorithm's Perspective: Short-Term Highs and Lows**

Before the formation of a low, there's a swing high. High-frequency trading algorithms use market structure on 3-minute, 2-minute, 1-minute charts and even sub-minute intervals (45-second, 30-second, 15-second).

*   **Algorithm's Operation:** Challenge yourself to check the charts because this happens everyday.

*What the algorithms are doing corrects the misinformation that is put out.*

*   **Key Observation:** If a short-term high is taken out right before a low forms *after* sell stops below an old low are hit, it is significant.

### **Liquidity and Logic: Buy Stops and Sell Stops**

We are trading above highs, so unknown orders or buy stops are neophyte perspectives on price action. There is always liquidity. Logic dictates that there is buying and selling at all times, so look at the chart. However, buying and selling "strength" has no bearing on where the prices are going to go. *I don't care about opinions from people who used to be on the floor of the Chicago board of trade or the mercantile exchange.* This is because they did not design the algorithm.

*   **Above Old Highs:** Expect buy stops (liquidity).
*   **Below Old Lows:** Expect sell stops (liquidity).

## **Anticipating Market Structure Shifts (Revisited)**

When the run above the relative equal highs happens, anticipate a market structure shift. *Don't force it or try to get ahead of it.*

*   **Advanced Techniques:** There are ways to know when to sell short right above the highs, even before the shift. Similarly, there are ways to know when to buy down near the lows without seeing the short-term high broken.

*   **Swing Low Analysis:** We have this high on this candle, then the candle right after that here. The highest one and then the lower high of this candle here.

### **Swing High Example**

We have this **swing low.** If you look at this swing low, and the highest of a candle is broken with another candle, this is significant only on the basis that we have taken liquidity out of the marketplace.

*   When this high is broken, it's more meaningful, and the market will seek buy stops above.

*I shared an example of live executions.*

### **Micros and E-Mini Nasdaq 100 Futures**

*   Micros: $2 per handle / $0.50 per tick
*   Nasdaq E-mini: $20 per handle / $5 per tick (4 ticks per handle)

*There are some that will doubt the idea that you can trade all these little internal swings.*

## **Homework and Challenge**

The main context of this lesson is to **go into your charts and try to prove me wrong**. Backtest what is being taught here to see if it is true or not.

*   **Mission:** Go into the charts and look for this NOT being true.
*   **Backtesting:** Understand what to look for and how to screen capture your findings.
*   **Mindset:** Don't just take my word for it; convince yourself. This is what I did back in 2010 on BabyPips.

*Once you start seeing it, it's over. Simple logic.*

## **Chart Annotations and Avoiding Over-Analysis**

*Is this a clean chart? I'm only going to add a few annotations.* There are people putting graffiti all over their charts and you can't even see the candles. Algorithms don't care about triangles, harmonic patterns, etc.

*This is facetious.*

### **Visualizing Liquidity**

*   **Sell Stops (Below 14,600):** This area is shaded in as an area where sell stops would be residing.

The market enters this liquidity pool. When the market rallies above it, you have a shift in market structure.

*   **Shift Indication:** Once the high is taken, you can anticipate.

*   **Candle Analysis:** Once the candle closes, you want to see if the candle creates a fair value gap. *High, single pass up, next candle has a low, it doesn't overlap, fair value.* That candle where the gap happens is where you can potentially trade at the earliest.

## **Order Block Theory and Fair Value Gaps**

I am going to correct all of you today so that way you can teach your people correctly and not hurt them.

*   Those down closed candles are all one continuous order block in the pool of liquidity from the sell stops. The open of that down series of down closed candles is the price level. Inside this fair value gap, the opening price of the order block is your buy plus three pips or whatever for spread.

### **Buy Stops and Take Profit Targets**

Where does price start to run? Above the highs where buy stops will be.

*Review the live execution example on this day*.

## **Final Thoughts and Important Disclaimers**

*   **Reality Check:** *People will tell you I don't trade this way. These people don't know how I'm trading. You have no idea how I'm trading.*
*   **Mentorship Status:** The paid mentorship is not open. *Please stop emailing and asking to join.*
*   **Value of Free Content:** Be content with what you're getting here. I'm teaching you gold for free.

*If it doesn't work, you'll know right away. I'm going right into the brass tacks so the weak-minded will know. The individuals that put the time in and test what I'm challenging them to will see that it repeats.*

### **Mindset is Key**

It's important that you have that mindset. So the buy stops above were taken and the swing low forms. Once this candle closes, you want to see if that candle goes below that short-term low.

*   **Bearish Shift:** If so, you have a bearish market structure shift because buy stops have been taken.

If the market rallies up into the swing low and you go short there, you are looking for sell stops. This works on futures, forex, etc.


# **ICT Mentorship - Additional Concepts and Analysis**

## **Introduction**

In this session, we'll delve into further concepts and analysis related to market structure, liquidity, and algorithmic behavior.

### **Trader's Perspective and Market Experience**

As someone approaching 50 with 30 years of market experience (since November 5th), I'm sharing insights applicable across all asset classes. While I don't actively trade crypto, my students confirm these concepts work there as well. *These are not "one-trick pony" insights.*

## **Trade Management and Target Selection**

### **Partial Profit Taking**

*   **Considerations:** Taking partial profits is a crucial aspect of trade management.
*   **Example:** In a short position, taking partials below a nearby low might not be optimal if a more significant low is within reach. Why not aim for the latter?
*   **Rationale:** If targeting a short position, there may not be much movement below a nearby low. Therefore, aim for the more substantial low.

### **Elements of a Trade Setup**

*   **Key Concept:** Aim for low-hanging fruit (the easiest target).
*   **Example:** A target below the 50% level of a specific high and low.
*   **Objective:** The candle's low serves as the initial objective within a fair value gap.
*   **Progression:** Over time, strive to hold positions aiming for the candle's high.

### **Understanding Market Dynamics**

*   **Liquidity and Market Behavior:** Gauge market behavior without certainty, as the market reveals its hand.
*   **Process:** Identify liquidity and observe market reactions without needing absolute certainty beforehand. The market will eventually reveal its intentions.

## **One-Minute Chart Analysis**

### **Revisiting Price Structure**

The same price structure and logic apply on a one-minute chart. A swing high is taken after liquidity is traded into.

### **Algorithmic Activity**

*   **High-Frequency Algorithms:** These algorithms rapidly execute orders, constantly offering price.
*   **Impact:** The volume isn't necessarily *causing* the market to rise; it's fueling the upward movement as algorithms continuously offer higher prices.
*   **Slippage:** Be aware of slippage. Attempting to buy at 1462 might result in a fill at 1464 (negative slippage), or potentially 1461 (positive slippage).

### **Challenging Conventional Wisdom**

*   **Buying/Selling Pressure:** Price rallies due to algorithms continuously offering prices at higher levels.
*   **Expert Opinions:** Disregard opinions that contradict this algorithmic perspective. *Don't listen to people who used to trade on the floor.*
*   **Personal Challenge:** Review your charts and verify if these suggestions align with reality.

## **Market Structure and Order Blocks**

### **Swing Low Analysis**

*   The market breaks down and trades back up into the "back up atmosphere."
*   Multiple execution points are available on the one-minute chart.

### **Bearish Order Blocks**

*   **Consecutive Candles:** Two consecutive bearish candles form a bearish order block.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Gap present.
    *   Liquidity taken.
    *   Market structure shift.
*   **Definition:** A change in the state of delivery.
    *   The market offers higher prices in up-close candles.
    *   The series begins with a candle's opening.
    *   When the candle trades below this opening, the state of delivery changes.

### **Change in State of Delivery**

*   **Down-Closed Candles:** The opening price of these candles initiates sell-side delivery.
*   **Violation:** When that opening price is violated, the state changes, and the market seeks buy stops.
*   **Retail Misconceptions:** Many incorrectly teach these concepts, especially regarding order blocks.

### **Algorithm's Perspective (Revisited)**

*   **Buy-Side Liquidity:** Buy-side liquidity is offered until the opening price is violated.
*   **Sell-Side Liquidity:** The change in the state of delivery then causes the market to offer sell-side liquidity, targeting sell stops.
*   **Retail Impact:** Retail buying and selling has minimal impact on these dynamics.

### **Addressing Market Narratives**

*   **Bull and Bear Squeezes:** These are common explanations, but the algorithmic perspective offers a deeper understanding.
*   **Discounted Markets:** The market moves from a premium to a discount relative to a specific high/low range.
*   **Equilibrium:** The 50% level represents equilibrium.

## **Chart Examples and Validations**

### **One-Minute Chart Example**

*   **Swing High Broken:** Market structure turns bullish, triggering rallies and targeting buy stops.
*   **Liquidity Engineering:** Highs act as engineered liquidity, attracting buyers at higher prices.
*   **Smart Money Strategy:** Smart money sells to these high-seeking buyers, capitalizing on positions bought lower.

### **Order Block Confirmation**

*   **Gap Identification:** The presence of a gap alongside a down-closed candle indicates an order block.

### **Trade Execution Example**

*   The market is bought at a gap, then sold short into stops before reversing and riding the larger swing down.

## **Personal Trading Journey**

### **Experience and Proof**

Having traded and lived in the markets for 30 years (as of November 5th), I'm providing proof and insights based on extensive experience. The purpose of this year is to put out valuable information and enjoy the reactions, including the naysayers.

### **Chart Cleanliness and Focus**

*   **Minimal Distractions:** Clean charts are essential to avoid distractions.
*   **Fluidity:** Avoid preconceived notions and allow flexibility in interpreting market actions.
*   **Internal Dialogue:** Annotations are added for students, reflecting the thought process during live observation.

## **Key Timeframes and Market Sessions**

### **Session Highs and Lows**

*   **London Session:** 2:00 AM - 5:00 AM (New York Time)
*   **New York Session:** 7:00 AM - 10:00 AM (New York Time)
*   **Asia Session:** 7:00 PM - 9:00 PM
*   *Focus on highs and lows during these sessions.*
*   *Also note any intraday high/low forming right before the equities open at 9:30 AM.*

### **Hours of Operation**

*   **General Trading Window:** 8:30 AM - 11:00 AM (New York Time)
*   **Lunch Hour:** Avoid trading during the noon hour due to problematic conditions.
*   **Afternoon Trend:** Opportunities often arise between 1:30 PM and 4:00 PM, particularly between 2:00 PM and 3:00 PM.

## **Key Concepts Review**

### **Internal Range Liquidity**

Short-term highs or lows within a price leg that is retracing or an imbalance in that same range of price action

### **Essential Elements**

*   Market structure shifts.
*   Identification of liquidity pools.

## **Homework Assignment**

### **Objective**

Identify stop hunts that lead to intraday market structure shifts.

### **Process**

1.  **Review Charts:** Analyze E-mini futures intraday charts.
2.  **Identify Stop Hunts:** Look for instances where the market runs for stops above old highs or below old lows.
3.  **Confirm Market Structure Shift:** Verify the signature market structure shift on 3, 2, or 1-minute charts.
4.  **Timeframe:** Focus on the period between 8:30 AM and noon (New York Time).
5.  **Document Findings:** Log your examples and annotations in your study journal.

### **Progression**

Start with recent data and work backward, annotating charts to reinforce understanding.


# **Enhanced Insights on Market Dynamics and Trading Strategies**

## **Understanding Market Mechanics**

### **Pseudo Experience and Brain Training**

The more experience you gain, even if it's "pseudo experience," the more you train your brain. I often use the analogy of hunters with my paid mentorship students.

*   **Hunter Analogy:**
    *   To find a deer, you need to know how to track it.
    *   This involves recognizing deer tracks.
    *   Before being shown one, you might not know what a deer track looks like.

### **Focus on Essential Details**

This lesson focuses predominantly on the visual details of what to look for in the market.

*   You don't need anything beyond what I've shown you.
*   It's simple and straight to the point.
*   There's no need for Commitment of Traders reports or breakers.

### **Universally Simplistic Trading Approach**

This approach is stripped down to the essentials.

*   It is universally simplistic and should be easy for everyone to grasp.
*   I even believe my daughter, who has no interest in trading, could easily understand it.
*   It involves specific times of the day and specific highs and lows.

## **Backtesting and Study Journal**

### **The Importance of Chart Annotation**

You won't appreciate the simplicity until you annotate your charts.

*   Annotate your 15-minute time frame for buy-side and sell-side liquidity pools.
*   Then, go down to the 3-minute, 2-minute, or 1-minute chart.

### **Backtesting as Chart Dressing**

Backtesting involves dressing up your chart as I've shown you and then studying it.

*   Really study how price moved and how it delivered.
*   Note how many pips it moved, how long it moved higher or lower, and how much drawdown it put on your position.
*   Annotate all of these things in your chart.

### **Study Journal for Encouragement**

When you feel confused, go back through your study journal and look at these examples.

*   It will encourage you during times when things aren't clicking.
*   You'll see these patterns happening every single day.
*   Don't amplify your lack of experience into a belief that you can't learn this.

### **The Secret to Success: Backtesting and Logging**

The more time you spend backtesting and logging examples, the better.

*   Many people say they do it, but they don't put in the required effort.
*   It requires work, effort, organization, and personal responsibility.

## **Live Trade Example: Nasdaq E-Mini Contract**

### **TradingView Setup**

We're looking at a TradingView chart with the TD Ameritrade platform open on top.

*   I'll highlight a fair value gap after a bullish market structure shift.
*   I'll show you an imbalance that is in a premium.

### **Fair Value Gap Strategy**

The idea is to see the price drop down into the green area (fair value gap).

*   If there are two fair value gaps, let it trade down to the lower one.
*   If it trades into the lower one and comes back up into the higher one, enter when it's in there.
*   Expect that the lower one won't be retested.

### **Risk Management**

I'll be trading with a stop that represents about 3.25% risk.

*   This is just my personal approach, not a suggestion for you.
*   I have faith in this strategy based on 30 years of experience.

### **Trade Execution**

If the market runs up into the upper rectangle first, I'll nix the trade.

*   I want to see if it goes down to the lower, unhighlighted fair value gap.
*   I'm willing to sacrifice the better entry at the lower gap.

### **Live Account Monitoring**

You'll see the Nasdaq symbol and my profit/loss in the TD Ameritrade live account module.

*   The S&P trade was basically a scratch, making only $75.

### **Psychology of Live Trading**

It can feel scary when you've never traded with live funds.

*   Don't focus on the money you're making or losing.
*   Watch the chart and see if it continuously gives you feedback that it's accumulating and not going lower.

### **Allowing for Market Fluctuations**

It's permissible for the market to go back into the lower fair value gap one more time.

*   I'm desensitizing myself to minor movements in the price action.
*   The ideal scenario is that it doesn't go lower, but I'm allowing for it.

### **Analyzing Market Pressure**

They're taking it down one more time to accumulate more longs.

*   It's not selling pressure driving price down.
*   There was a $455 drawdown while still in the trade.

### **Targeting the Low-Hanging Fruit**

I'm focusing on the bottom of the pink rectangle (the low-hanging fruit).

*   While learning, it's easier to let it trade to the low end and take it off when it gives it to you.
*   I have my trigger on the flatten button to cancel all orders and take me out of the market.

### **Trade Result**

The trade was collapsed, resulting in an $1190 gain.

*   The account balance now reflects $27,915.11.

## **Chart Verification**

### **TradingView Chart Analysis**

We'll look at the chart on TradingView to verify the trade.

*   The executions and the areas I showed you on the TradingView chart will be visible.

### **Transparency**

I'm showing you everything, nothing is hidden.

### **Closing Remarks**

I humbly submit this live trade example.

*   I'll talk to you on Thursday, be safe.

Okay, here is the meticulously organized and refined version of the text, retaining every detail and nuance:

# **2022 ICT Mentorship: Intraday Order Flow and Understanding the Daily Range**

**Video URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N29ZJ-o31xs

## **Introduction**

Welcome back to the 2022 ICT mentorship on YouTube! This lesson focuses on intraday order flow and understanding the daily range.

## **Platform: Tradingview.com**

*   We will be using **Tradingview.com** for charting.
*   It's a free platform, with membership benefits available (though not terribly expensive).
*   You'll be able to see and use the same charts that are used in my mentorship and private group.
*   The lessons here are the same ones used in the private community.

## **Lecture Focus**

This lecture will primarily teach you:

*   Elements of the **E-mini**.
*   Setting up your **daily range**.
*   **Intraday layouts**.
*   A little bit on **daily profiles**.
*   A comparison of what you're learning here versus what's available on the internet, so you can see the value proposition.

## **Target Markets**

*   These teachings are directly linked to **index futures:**
    *   **S&P 500 (ES)**
    *   **NASDAQ (NQ)**
    *   **Dow (YM)**
    *   **Russell 2000 (RTY)**

## **Important Note on Strategy**

*   The ideas of trading the Asian range are **NOT** applicable to these markets.
*   Focus solely on the information provided in this mentorship.

## **Contract Months and Expiration**

### **Symbols & Codes**

*   When looking at futures, especially index futures, contracts trade with expiration dates.
*   **ES** is the symbol for **E-mini S&P 500**.
*   **Delivery Month Codes:**
    *   **H = March**
    *   **M = June**
    *   **U = September**
    *   **Z = December**
*   These are the *only* four months that E-mini S&P, E-mini NASDAQ, and E-mini Dow trade on.
*   **Example:** ES *H2022* represents the E-mini S&P 500 contract for delivery month March, year 2022 in TradingView. (TD Ameritrade does not include the "20" in the year, just the last two digits "22").

### **Expiration Date**

*   Expiration occurs on the **third Friday** of the delivery month (March, June, September, December).
*   **DO NOT** trade after expiration.

### **Rolling Over to the Next Month**

*   **"Front Month" / "Current Month" / "Nearby Contract":** The current month's contract.
*   **"Next Month Out":** The month *after* the front month.
*   When to start trading the next month out? Check Barchart.com.

## **Using Barchart.com to Find the Front Month**

1.  Go to **barchart.com**.
2.  Go to the **"Select Commodity"** tab.
3.  Scroll down to **"S&P 500 E-mini"**.
4.  The first contract listed (**"Cash"**) is not what you want.
5.  The **next** contract is the **front month**.
6.  **Open Interest** is the key metric to watch.

### **Open Interest Monitoring**

*   **One week before expiration** (third Friday of the delivery contract month), start monitoring open interest.
*   **Rule:** Trade the month with the **LARGER open interest**.
*   **Example (March 2022):**
    *   March Contract: Larger Open Interest
    *   June Contract: smaller Open Interest
*   **If the next month out has a larger open interest, trade it.**
*   The goal is to trade where the **largest liquidity pool** is.

## **Intraday Framework (Teaching bias and specific entry techniques next week)**

### **Bullish Bias Reminder**

*   We will assume a bullish bias for this example (proof of bullish bias and actual execution will be provided later).
*   I know some of you are anxious to learn how to get in but take the lessons at the pace that I'm giving them to you.

### **Homework Assignments**

*   Think about Market Profiles. Homework assignments at the end of the video.

### **15-Minute Time Frame: The "Bellwether"**

*   The **15-minute time frame** is crucial.
*   Look for:
    *   **Key highs and lows**.
    *   **Imbalances like Fair Value Gaps.**
    *   **Order Blocks** (though we will try to stay away from order blocks in this lesson).
*   **Focus:** Fair Value Gaps (a repetitive, easy-to-spot pattern).

## **Framing Your Day: New York Local Time**

### **Setting Up Time Boundaries**

1.  In TradingView (recommended for this mentorship), set up vertical lines.
2.  **8:30 AM New York Local Time:** Morning Trade Session start.
3.  **Noon New York Local Time:** New York Lunch
4.  **1:00 PM New York Local Time:** Afternoon Trade Session start
5.  **Note**: Set your TradingView chart to New York local time to ensure proper calibration and alignment with the instructor's charts.

### **Boundaries**

*   **Morning Trade:** 8:30 AM (news events) to noon (ideally around 11:00 AM - prefer not to take trades after 11 AM). Position before 11:00 AM.
*   **New York Lunch:** Noon to 1:00 PM New York Time: **NO TRADE TIME**.  *DO NOT TRADE DURING THIS TIME* (even in demo).
*   **Afternoon Session:** I wasn't going to teach it but I'm teaching it now because of all of the nonsense on YouTube.
*   These are your boundaries.

### **Objective**

*   Complete daily treaties on the entire daily range of indices so you have a better chance of being successful using the information that I am giving you.

## **Pre-8:30 AM Analysis: Stop Hunts**

### **Catalyst Identification**

*   What highs and lows are you looking for?
*   What would be the catalyst for a stop hunt?

### **Horizontal Ray Technique**

*   We'll grab a horizontal ray and use the benefit of hindsight to go back and back test everything.

### **Identifying Key Swing Points**

*   Look at the price prior to 8:30 on the 15 minute time frame.

1.  **Significant Swing High:**
    *   A candle with a lower high to the left *and* right of it (three-candle pattern).
    *   Indicates buy-side liquidity (buy stops) above.

2.  **Significant Swing Low:**
    *   A candle with a higher low to the left *and* right of it (three-candle pattern).

*   **Note:** Candle close direction (up or down) is irrelevant.
*   Swing points indicate where liquidity is going to be placed.

### **Lower Time Frame Entry (5-Minute Chart)**

*   Once you've identified these levels on the 15-minute time frame, drop down to the 5-minute chart for entry.

## **The "Three Drives" Pattern & Stop Hunts**

### **Old Highs & Equal Highs**

*   The old high price on the example candle right there is 4514.50.

### **Multiple Short-Term Highs:**

*   If there's three highs that go up like that it's a classic **three drives pattern.**

### **Linda Raschke and Larry Connors**

*   Linda Raschke and Larry Connors' book, *"Street Smarts"*, helped me understand stop hunts.
*   They described the **"three little endings"** pattern (basically the three drives pattern).
*   **Definition:** A swing high, a higher swing high, and an even higher swing high.

### **Pattern Implications**

*   Every time it creates a swing high and it starts to go down, bears are trying to sell that and they're putting buy stops above the previous high.
*   Informed investors will already be establishing short positions.
*   The market then breaks.

### **Displacement**

*   What to do when a particular swing low that looks like it's been violated, but it doesn't work out? Think about this idea that I teach, which is displacement.
*   If you have a children's swimming pool...


Okay, here is the meticulously organized and refined version of the text, retaining every detail and nuance:

## **Understanding Displacement, Stop Hunts, and Intraday Market Dynamics**

### **Displacement: The "Elephant in the Swimming Pool" Analogy**

*   Imagine a children's swimming pool filled with water. If an elephant falls into it, the water will be displaced significantly.
*   This is analogous to price action. When price goes above an old high and trades down below it, look for **obvious displacement**.
*   Avoid lethargic movements. The displacement should be significant, like an "elephant falling into that children's swimming pool."
*   When this occurs, look for a **Fair Value Gap** (low, high). If price trades back up into that gap, consider a short position.

### **Rules and Risk Management**

*   Understand the process of learning these concepts.
*   There are rules for a reason.
*   These patterns can sometimes fail. You may misread them, or they simply won't work.
*   News events can disrupt patterns. The market may roll over them and go higher/lower.
*   **Risk Management is Key:** Use a stop loss and sound money management.
*   Without risk management, Murphy's Law will apply: whatever can go wrong, will.
*   Limit the potential pain by controlling risk.

### **Anticipating Highs and Energetic Movement**

*   Consider a previous high and previous low.
*   If higher highs *do not* form and it's just a steady run up, anticipate a high to be taken out.
*   It doesn't need to be taken out by much.
*   Look for an **energetic movement lower – displacement**. It should appear pronounced on your chart.

### **Example Scenario**

*   As price moves towards an old high (before 8:30 AM), look for a swing high.
*   If price trades above it but *doesn't* have an energetic break below, it's a weak, anemic move.
*   If there's another run higher with a wick or tail that snaps back quickly, it *doesn't* create a Fair Value Gap *yet*.
*   Then, if price goes higher, matches that high, and *then* goes below it *with force*, and the next candle closes, that's your Fair Value Gap. That signals a short opportunity.

### **Trading the Fair Value Gap**

*   Reach for the liquidity resting below the low that you identified before 8:30 AM.
*   Sell-side liquidity matches up with your short.
*   Sell, and then buy back to cover the short.
*   Waiting sellers are present in the form of sell stops.

### **Long Entry Considerations**

*   You may not always see a potential continuation of bullishness.
*   Look at the highs. Buy stops/buy-side liquidity rests above them.
*   Right before lunch hour, price goes slightly above the highs and then trades down.

### **New York Lunch Hour: Avoid Trading**

*   **Do NOT trade during New York lunch hour (noon to 1:00 PM New York Time).**
*   It can involve erratic price action or sideways movement.
*   It's generally not a clean time of day for price action.

### **Afternoon Liquidity and Market Dynamics**

*   The high of the day exists, and liquidity rests above it.
*   This liquidity wasn't tagged by the earlier move.
*   Stops are resting a little above that high, as traders are trying to sell short.
*   A low was created the previous week, and the market has already declined significantly.
*   It's pulling back up in the run it created going lower on a daily chart.
*   All buy-side liquidity pools are a reason for the market to move higher.

### **Post-Lunch Analysis and Strategy**

*   You don't *have* to participate as a buyer earlier in the day.
*   After lunch (at 1:00 PM), watch for indications that price wants to move higher.
*   Buy-side liquidity was aggressively targeted.
*   The market trades aggressively bullish right into the close.
*   Small retracements may occur.

### **End-of-Day Algorithms and Price Action**

*   Expect the algorithms driving price runs to cap the majority of the day's volume.
*   **Key Concept:** The day is designed to have a morning move, a lunch hour (no trading), and an afternoon move.

### **Homework Assignment: Analyzing Market Sessions**

*   Review your charts (as far back as you want).
*   Create charts like those described.
*   Describe the morning trend: bullish, bearish, or consolidation?
*   If consolidation, was the previous day(s) bullish or bearish? This can indicate a continuation.
*   Relative equal highs forming can paint the idea of retail resistance.
*   Traders may think price will go lower, building up buy-side liquidity (buying interest at a high price, even as a short entry).
*   Protective stops will be in the form of buy stops.

### **Swing Lows and Accumulation**

*   Ignore the swing low during lunchtime.
*   If swing lows (each candle with a higher low to the left and right) form and increase, it indicates accumulation and a desire to move higher.
*   The market wants to clean out the liquidity resting above.
*   Price may have been going up for a few days on the daily chart.
*   Sentiment may be that everyone wants to sell short, anticipating a stock market crash.
*   They may not realize that price already went down below an old low on the daily chart and is now running back in the other direction.
*   Anyone trying to sell short (unless it's a quick intraday scalp) may be losing money.

### **Afternoon Trend Characteristics**

*   There are built-in mechanisms that help the market accelerate into the close.
*   Study price action on lower time frame charts.
*   A repeating phenomenon typically occurs around 20 minutes to 4, 10 minutes to 4, and at 4:00 PM.
*   This is based on Market-on-Close orders.
*   Algorithms may start spitting out aggressive pricing, forcing traders to cover or exit their trades.
*   If price is going up, it usually ramps up and accelerates in that direction.

### **Morning vs. Afternoon Trading**

*   The morning session has a lot of volatility and excitement.
*   If you know your daily bias (discussed next week) and what you're looking for in terms of range expansion on the daily chart, you can look for afternoon trades.

### **Daily Range Expansion**

*   Is the daily candle likely to expand higher or lower? (Not trying to predict every close, but determine the likely direction).
*   If your analysis indicates expansion higher, trade with the expectation of finding a trade in the afternoon, based on the morning's logic.

### **Forex and Intraday Parallels**

*   Think about the concepts taught in Forex: the daily range, initial high/low of the day.
*   This could be like a London low in a buy day for Forex.
*   The low of the day, consolidation, and then the New York continuation running in the same direction as the London session (but this is all New York time).

### **Chart Calibration is Crucial**

*   **Make sure your TradingView charts are set to New York time.**
*   Otherwise, everything you're learning will be a mess.

### **Repeating Patterns**

*   The patterns are the same every day.

### **Homework Review: Session Analysis and Daily Charts**

*   Outline what the session was in the morning and what the afternoon session did.
*   Sometimes it will be bullish in the morning and reverse in the afternoon.
*   Sometimes it will be bullish in the morning and continue higher in the afternoon (a measured move).
*   A measured move might be a duplication of the morning move (e.g., 200 points in the morning, another 200 points in the afternoon, for a total of 400 points).
*   Sometimes consolidation in the morning session will lead to a trend in the afternoon (higher or lower).
*   Go through your charts and look at this on an intraday basis.
*   Study what the daily chart was showing on days that had these nice runs (yesterday and the previous Friday).

### **Contrasting Approaches**

*   Compare and contrast what's being taught here with what's predominantly shown on YouTube regarding index futures trading.
*   Some traders may get in at a price and try to capture a small move.
*   They might use many contracts and experience anxiety about whether the move will be in their favor, worrying about their stop getting hit.
*   Don't think like that.

### **A Better Approach: Identifying the Swing Low**

*   If the day was bullish, find the first swing low after 1:30 PM.
*   **Key Times:** 1:30 PM is when to start looking for swing highs and swing lows for the afternoon session.

### **Why 1:30 PM?**

*   There's a macro algorithm that starts running at 1:30 PM, creating movement in the New York session for equity markets.
*   (This is beyond the scope of this mentorship).
*   Look for a swing high and a swing low.
*   Use the same basis of looking for a stop hunt in the morning for the afternoon.

### **Stop Hunt Considerations**

*   If a level looks too clean (straight line edges), it probably won't stay that way. There will be a disruption.
*   If the market has been going higher, there's pent-up aggression to continue.
*   Short-term resistance may exist.
*   Algorithms may reserve the price run until later in the day.

### **Buy Programs and Market Manipulation**

*   A swing low that gets violated can trigger a buy program.
*   A buy program is when the algorithms continuously offer higher prices, regardless of volume.
*   The volume may sometimes be good, and other times, it may make no sense (signature of manipulation).

### **Profiting from Manipulation**

*   If the market is being manipulated, it's profitable to know what it's likely to do.
*   These things tend to repeat.
*   If the same fingerprints are present, it will probably pan out.

### **Long Entries and Holding for the Close**

*   Enter long positions and hold for the close.
*   Avoid trying to trade small moves, over-leveraging, and using more contracts than your account can handle.
*   Cheap/discount leverage can be dangerous, especially in fast markets.
*   The markets can be very quick and violent, and you can be dismantled quickly if you don't know what you're doing.

### **Example of a Stop Hunt**

*   Inside an area, the market creates a swing low and runs through it (stop hunt).
*   Stops below are sell stops.
*   Buy...


Here's the meticulously organized and refined version of the provided text, retaining every detail and nuance:

## **Trading Strategies: Stop Hunts, Fair Value Gaps, and Market Manipulation**

### **Buying Sell Stops**

*   **Sell Stops & Fear:** I know it feels scary, but go through your charts and you'll see many examples of this happening.
*   **The Pattern:** It's the same thing. Buy the sell stops that are resting below a level and expect that level to be taken out.
*   **Lunchtime Consolidation:** There's consolidation through lunch.
*   **Afternoon Strategy:** After 1:30 PM in the afternoon, wait for a swing low to be violated and then rally.

### **Alternative Scenario: Displacement Higher**

*   **No Swing Low Violation?** What if you don't get a swing low that trades below it?
*   **Look for Displacement:** Well, you look for a move higher that's sudden - **displacement higher.**
*   **Fair Value Gap:** Then look for a **Fair Value Gap**. If it trades back down into the **Fair Value Gap**, you buy that.
*   **Two Patterns:** There's your two patterns. That's it. That's the only two patterns you need.
*   **No Gimmicks:** You don't need 15 different gimmicky names. Okay? You don't need Breakers, you don't need an order block.

### **Strategy Simplicity**

*   **Easy Strategy:** See how easy that is? Very simple strategy.
*   **Trade Logic:** You have a trade one way or the other, and the logic has to be there for either one of them to form.

### **NASDAQ Example: Applying the Strategy**

*   **NASDAQ Focus:** I was not in the E-mini S&P today; I was trading NASDAQ.
*   **Chart Preparation:** I'm going to save time and not put all the lipstick on the chart. I hope you can allow me that.
*   **1:30 PM:** Here is 1:30 PM.
*   **Swing Low:** We have a swing low there, and it's basically almost the same low as that one.
*   **Swing Low Violation:** Trading down below it.
*   **Fair Value Gap:** Look further to the left - Fair Value Gap. Man, it can't be that easy. It can't be that easy.
*   **Relative Equal Highs:** Relative equal highs; what's above that? Buy-side liquidity.
*   **One-Minute Chart:** Drop into a one-minute chart and scrub back here to 1:30 PM.

### **Avoiding Over-Leveraging**

*   **No Need for Excessive Contracts:** I don't need to do 20 contracts or 10 contracts to do like a $20,000 day.
*   **Flavor of the Month:** That's kind of like the flavor of the month right now.

### **Identifying Retail Support**

*   **Relative Equal Lows:** If you look at this low and this low here, what are those? They're relative equal lows.
*   **Retail Perspective:** So that's going to be viewed as what? Support, retail support.
*   **Chasing the Market:** They're going to buy those little runs here. They're basically going to chase that.

### **Buying the Sell Stops**

*   **Sell Stops Below:** If you look at this through the scope of below this level, there's sell stops.
*   **Bullish Bias:** You think it's going to go higher, like I believed it was going to go higher today; I want to be buying those stops.
*   **Watching the Price Action:** Say you're watching price; it's meandering through, through, through.
*   **Swing Low Formation:** Then all of a sudden, that swing low forms right there.
*   **Sudden Drop:** We had this low here, and we had this sudden drop down.
*   **Aggressive Move:** When you see that, if you're watching it on a one-minute chart, that's going to look so dynamic, so aggressive.
*   **Feeling the Pressure:** If you're zoomed in, it's going to feel like the floor has just dropped out.
*   **Buying Opportunity:** But that's exactly what you're looking for to buy.

### **Contrasting Trading Styles**

*   **YouTube Comparison:** You're Going To See fellas out there on YouTube.
*   **Tick Scalpers:** There are folks out there that are trying to trade, you know, just a handful of ticks with a lot of contracts.
*   **Illogical Approach:** That to me doesn't make any sense.
*   **If It Works, Great:** But if that works for you, then great.
*   **Consider the Logic:** But I want you to think about in comparison and by contrast what seems more logical for you to feel it's worth more to pursue in study and learning.
*   **High Risk, Low Reward vs. Better Alternative:** How to do something like that where it's risk a lot, put a lot behind the trade, and try to get just a little bit of a move, or…

### **Demo Account Context**

*   **Demo Account:** Now, this is a demo account, okay, but I did trade live today too.
*   **Teaching Purposes:** But just for the purposes of teaching the content.

### **Precise Entries and Predictability**

*   **Low of the Candle:** Right there that low is the lowest candle.
*   **Rally:** It rallies all the way up.
*   **Close:** Right here that was a close.
*   **Better Way:** There's a better way to do this.
*   **Precision:** If you know what you're looking for, you can be very, very precise about it.
*   **Dialed In:** You can be dialed in like nobody's business.
*   **Predictability:** It is unbelievable in terms of the predictable nature of these markets.
*   **Institutional Trading:** Especially these markets because they're traded by a lot of institutions and a lot of professional traders.

### **Market Manipulation & Cleanliness**

*   **Manipulation:** The manipulation that takes place in these markets is still there.
*   **Less Vulgar:** But it's not as vulgar or ruthless as it is sometimes in Forex.
*   **Forex vs. Futures:** The inbank markets man, they can really, really, you know, do you dirty quick and more frequently.
*   **Cleaner Delivery:** The Futures Market, they tend to be a little bit more cleaner, a little bit more predictable, much more nicer in their delivery.

### **Handling Volatility**

*   **News Events:** Now, there are times when reports come out or something unannounced comes into the world scene and causes volatility.
*   **Noisy Price Action:** When that occurs, then you'll get that noisy look to price action.
*   **Stand Aside:** Just stand on the sidelines; wait for things to smooth out.
*   **Patience:** It may not be that same trading day; it may require you a day or or maybe even a week.
*   **Wait for Sync:** Let the markets go back into sync, and then they'll start delivering very nice again.

### **Focus on Market Mechanics**

*   **Entry Examples Not the Focus:** The main thing I want you to take away is that, you know, showing entries like this and ex and stuff, it's not all that much of a big deal.
*   **Stumbling Block:** But it becomes a sticking point, okay, a stumbling block for people that want to try to learn how to do this.

### **Understanding Price Action**

*   **Avoid Small Moves:** Because if you lay it in front of them, they have to have lots of contracts to do something to be profitable in such a small little move.
*   **Lack of Understanding:** To me, it communicates that that person that's trying to trade like that, whether it's the person that created the system or someone that's trying to learn the system, they really have no idea how price works and how it books.
*   **Trading Style:** Because if they did, they wouldn't be trying to take these little tiny little micro out of the marketplace.
*   **Trade with Conviction:** They would be trading like I'm showing you here.

### **Embracing the Daily Range**

*   **Submitting to the Range:** If you were to think to yourself, hey, I want to know what it's like to be in a move where I can be comfortable knowing that the daily range is going to unfold and I'm just going to submit to it.
*   **Opportunity in Futures:** Well, these markets offer that.
*   **Forex Potential:** Forex offers it too, but right now in the last couple months really Forex has been rather funky.
*   **Transition to Futures:** Because of that, we have transitioned to index Futures.

### **Seasonal Market Dynamics**

*   **Teaching Based on Liquidity:** There are times of the year where I teach index Futures Trading because they're predominantly more liquid.
*   **Commodity Example:** I'll point to Something in Futures it may be a commodity market like last year I told everybody buy the gray Market say we're going to have a huge bull market boom they went up.
*   **Navigating Price Action:** It's a matter of knowing how to navigate the price action.
*   **Summer Months:** These markets here except for the summer months and that being like July and August those months can be a little uh hit or miss.
*   **Professional Delivery:** If you're looking to have your trading business framed on a asset class that is really nice, it's professionally delivered where it's not like a bucket shop you know penny stock type Market it's these markets are really nice.
*   **Systematic Repetition:** They're very systematic in the way they do do things and they repeat.
### **Importance of Knowledge**
*   **Basic Understanding** But if you don't know what you're looking for or understanding Behind These mechanics that I'm outlining here at the very basic level then you can obviously hurt yourself still.

### **Strategic Trading Times**

*   **Real Moves:** So right away I'm showing you that there are times in the day that you want to be looking for setups you're not trying to do 25 trades you're not trying to do 30 trades you're not in there trying to Micro Scalp you're looking for the real moves in the morning and the real moves in the afternoon.
*   **One Good Trade:** Preferably if you get 1 in the morning you don't trade in the afternoon.
### **Practice and Risk Management**
*   **Demo Practice** Go to a demo and practice there don't give the money back to the marketplace especially while you're you know you're new don't do that.

### **Transparency and Authenticity**

*   **Live Account Trades:** And I'm actually telling you not to trade with live funds but I know a lot of you like to see things that are traded with a live account like it's a real um account that shows entries and and things of that nature and that's the things I'm doing this year.
*   **Short-Term Strategy** I'm not going to do it in 2023 I'm not going to do it forever okay I did it so that way my students can feel at ease about it because even in my in my paid mentorship group I don't trade live funds there because for my protection I'm doing what I'm showing you right here in a demo but I've been showing Live account trades this to approved it it works so hopefully you found this insightful and until I'll talk to you on Thursday be safe.

# **ICT Mentorship 2022: Market Efficiency Paradigm and Institutional Order Flow - Episode 6**

## **Introduction**

This episode focuses on understanding price delivery through the lens of institutional order flow and the market efficiency paradigm. The core concept is to analyze price action not through traditional retail methods but by internalizing the thought processes of "smart money."

## **Internalizing Price Delivery**

*   **Focus on Liquidity and Order Flow, Not Patterns Alone**: We should not trade patterns or indicators in isolation.
    Instead, we look for opportunities where retail traders are likely to be positioned incorrectly.
*   **Trade Against the Retail Crowd**:
    *   Enter long positions when retail is selling.
    *   Enter short positions when retail is buying.
*   **Understanding Smart Money**: The presenter acknowledges that everyone operates through retail avenues, but the key is to adopt the mindset and internal dialogue of institutions. This involves:
    *   Analyzing price differently than the majority of retail traders.
    *   Focusing on liquidity and order flow.
*   **Critique of Retail Analysis**: Most retail analysis concepts lack a solid foundation in liquidity and order flow, rendering them unreliable.
*   **Objective**: To anticipate price seeking opposing liquidity.

## **The Informed vs. Uninformed Money Dynamic**

Imagine price action as a battleground between two camps:

*   **Informed/Smart Money**: Represented by a small circle.
*   **Speculative/Uninformed Money (Retail)**: Represented by a much larger circle.

Key Observations:

*   **Constant Flux**: There is a continuous influx and outflow of uninformed money due to losses.
*   **Smart Money Approach**:
    *   They do not rely on secret indicators.
    *   Instead, they focus on **time** and **price**.
*   **Importance of Time**: **Time** is the most crucial element for professional traders.
    *   **Time of day** is vital: Algorithms cause price movements and short-term reversals at specific times.

## **Exploiting Retail Weaknesses**

*   **Smart Money's Objective**: To capitalize on the mistakes and directional biases of retail traders.
*   **Retail Stop Loss Dilemma**: Retail traders often struggle with stop loss placement.
    *   **Fear of Premature Stop-Out**: Placing stops too close to the current price, risking being stopped out before the intended move.
    *   **Fear of Large Losses**: Placing stops too far away, leading to significant losses if the market moves against them.
    *   Many retail traders don't use a stop loss.
*   **Smart Money's Focus**: Not on patterns, but on understanding the underlying liquidity and narrative.
    *   Analyzing the market to determine if it's bullish or bearish.
    *   Anticipating how the daily range will develop.
    *   Planning to acquire positions by targeting retail traders' stop losses.
*   **Market Efficiency Paradigm**: From a smart money perspective, market efficiency involves understanding how to utilize the liquidity provided by uninformed money.
*   **Technical Analysis Critique**: Traditional technical analysis is dismissed as "mumbo jumbo."
*   **Personal Accountability**: When trades based on this logic fail, it signifies an error in interpreting price action, not a flaw in the overall strategy.
*   **Avoiding Pattern-Based Trading**: Do not trade patterns for the sake of the pattern alone. Just because you think you see a pattern there.

## **Streamlined Learning Approach**

*   **Promise of Efficiency**: The presenter aims to simplify the learning process, enabling immediate application.
*   **Positive Feedback**: The presenter acknowledges positive feedback from viewers who have quickly grasped and applied these concepts.
*   **Call for Caution**: Viewers are encouraged to study and backtest the concepts before trading with real money.
*   **Unique Approach**: This is not typical stale ict learning, this is the things that really work in the marketplace

## **The Bearish ICT Fair Value Gap**

This is an institutional order flow pattern that reveals order flow in the marketplace.

*   **Debunking Volume Profile as a Religion**: Volume Profile is just data interpreted with a private understanding.
*   **Time-Based Charts**: Algorithms operate primarily based on time.

### **Definition and Characteristics**

*   **Three-Candle Formation**:
    1.  First candle's low is traded below by the immediate following candle.
    2.  Second candle trades with an extended low below candle #1 but doesn't trade back to candle #1's low.
    3.  Third candle is another continuation candle.
*   **The Gap**: A space created where price has not been efficiently offered on both the buy and sell sides. In a bearish fair value gap, price is only being offered on the sell side between candle #1's low and candle #3's high.
*   **Analogy**: Like painting a wall with a roller; as you roll down, you create porous pockets that require a reverse stroke to fill.
*   **Market Efficiency and Algorithms**: An algorithm drives efficient market delivery, seeking to balance inefficient areas in price.
*   **Trading Implication**: When price trades back into the gap, it presents a short opportunity with the expectation of further downward movement.

### **Optimal Formation**

*   **Prerequisite**: The bearish ICT fair value gap is most effective after a run into buy-side liquidity (price moving above an old high).
*   **Focus**: Look for the pattern only *after* a break down.
*   **Buy-Side Liquidity**: Represented by buy stops resting above old highs (single high or double top).
*   **Smart Money Strategy**: Smart money aims to trade up into this liquidity and then go short.

### **Chart Annotations**

*   **Labeling**:
    *   Candle 1.
    *   Candle 2 (where the gap resides).
    *   Candle 3 (gives lower end of fair value gap).
*   **Gap Boundaries**:
    *   Upper end: Low of Candle 1.
    *   Lower end: High of Candle 3.

### **Entry and Stop Loss**

*   **Entry**: Enter short just above Candle 3's high using a limit order.
*   **Stop Loss**: Place the stop loss above Candle 1 (more conservative) or Candle 2.
*   **Recommendation for Beginners**: Start with a wider stop loss range when learning.

## **Bearish Market Structure Shift**

*   **Concept**: The market trades higher, retraces, and trades above an old high. Then the market breaks down.
*   **Trigger**: Once the low is broken, a new trade idea is birthed.
*   **Sequence**: Determining the entry point is a process that follows this structure.


Okay, here's the organized and refined version of the provided text, with all details, context, and nuances preserved:

# **Bearish & Bullish ICT Fair Value Gaps - Continued**

## **Bearish Market Structure Shift - Displacement**

*   **Price Action**: The market will rally above an old high (or highs) and then quickly shift lower.
*   **Significance of "Quick"**: The term "quick" is directly linked to **displacement**.
*   **Energetic Movement**: The downward shift must be energetic, not lethargic. It should show a real willingness to go lower.
*   **Preferable Close**: Ideally, the price should close below the short-term low after breaking below. A strong close provides more confirmation.
*   **Wick vs. Displacement**: A small wick below the low, followed by a return upwards, is less convincing than a strong close below.

### **Market Structure Shift: Timeframe Agnostic**

*   The following principles apply to all timeframes, though the focus here is intraday trading.
*   A high is created, followed by a low that breaks a short-term low. This represents a shift in market structure.

### **Displacement High and Low**

*   **Displacement Low**: The low that breaks the short-term low is identified as the "displacement low".
*   **Displacement High**: The high that forms before the break is the "displacement high".
*   **Importance of Range**: The range between these two levels is crucial.
*   **Fair Value Gap Location**: Fair Value Gaps often form within the range defined by the displacement high and low. All examples should have this.

### **Bearish Scenario Recap**

*   **Bearish Bias**: You're bearish and observe price run above an old high.
*   **Break and Short-Term Low**: Price then breaks below the old high and takes out a short-term low *prior* to the run above.
*   **Displacement Range**: That range is between the displacement high and low.
*   **Energetic Close**: The price action must close *energetically* below that low. A strong, "beefy" bearish candle closing below is ideal.
*   **Fair Value Gap Watch**: As soon as that candle forms, watch for the creation of a fair value gap within the displacement range (between the displacement low and the high of the bearish candle).
*   **No Gap, No Trade**: If no fair value gap forms within that range, there is no trade setup. Wait for another opportunity or a different market. These form every single trading day on long and short positions.

## **Bullish ICT Fair Value Gap**

*   This is the opposite scenario and is presented more quickly.

### **Definition and Characteristics**

*   **Three-Candle Formation**: Institutional order flow pattern, defined by three candles.
    1. Candle 1.
    2. Candle 2.
    3. Candle 3.
*   **Gap Boundaries**:
    *   Low of the Fair Value Gap: Candle #1's High
    *   High of the Fair Value Gap: Candle #3's Low
*   **Location**: Candle #2 is where the fair value gap will form.

### **Prerequisites**

*   **Sell-Side Liquidity Grab**: Look for a market run below an old low (or multiple lows) to grab sell-side liquidity.
*   **Bullish Break**: Once this occurs, look for a run higher that takes out a short-term high.
*   **Energetic Displacement**: It closes *energetically* above it with *displacement* higher.
*   **Trade Idea Birth**: This sequence of events births a potential trade idea.

### **Fair Value Gap Identification**

*   **Location**: The fair value gap, if present, will reside between the *displacement high* and the *displacement low*. The displacement low is the low that ran into the sell stops. This occurs right before the market structure is broken bullishly.
*   **No Gap, No Trade**: If no fair value gap is present in this range, there is no trade setup.

### **Clarity and Specificity**

*   The presenter emphasizes the clarity and specificity of this approach, highlighting that it should not be altered or combined with other methods. Using anything other than this will NOT get the results you're looking for in reference to the Fair Value Gap.

## **Real-World Example: E-Mini Nasdaq (NQ) on February 3, 2022**

*   **Timing Frame**: The example uses the 15-minute timeframe.
*   **Bellwether Chart**: The presenter considers this the "bellwether chart," viewed "naked" (without indicators).
*   **Initial Task**: Identify a swing high where buy stops have likely been run.

### **Time Element: News Release at 8:30 AM**

*   **Catalyst**: Employment data was released at 8:30 AM.
*   **Swing High Identification**: Look to the left of the 8:30 AM mark to identify the first swing high.
*   **Drawing the Level**: Extend that high out in time.

### **Top-Down Analysis**

*   **15-Minute Level**: Once the level is identified on the 15-minute chart, begin "stripping down" to lower timeframes (5-minute, 4-minute, 3-minute, 2-minute, 1-minute).
*   **Transposition**: The levels identified on the 15-minute chart are transposed onto the lower timeframes.

### **Trading Opportunities at Lower Timeframes**

*   **5-Minute Chart**: Price trades above the 15-minute high and then begins to trade lower.
*   **4-Minute Chart**:
    *   Price trades below a swing low.
    *   Fair Value Gap: A fair value gap forms.
    *   Short Entry: A short entry could be taken at the high of this candle.
    *   Stop Loss: The stop loss could be placed above the swing high (candle #1) or the high of candle #2.

### **Fine-Tuning the Entry (Multiple Timeframes)**

*   The presenter admits to having the 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1-minute charts open simultaneously.
*   **2-Minute Chart**: The 2-minute chart also presents a fair value gap and the same entry/stop loss parameters.
*   **1-Minute Chart**:
    *   Run and Break: The 1-minute chart shows the run, the break below the short-term low, and a fair value gap.
    *   Multiple Entry Opportunities: Multiple opportunities to enter short exist.

### **Tight Entry Potential**

*   The 1-minute chart in particular offers a very tight entry.

### **Addressing Hindsight Concerns**

*   The presenter addresses potential accusations of "hindsight bias" by stating that he actually traded this setup live on TradingView that day.

## **TradingView Demonstration Using Replay Function**

*   **Disclaimer**: The presenter notes that they don't use the TradingView replay button. This demonstration is solely for teaching purposes.
*   **Data Delay**: It is noted that TradingView data is often delayed. The presenter pays for a subscription to get real-time e-mini data. This is not required for learning.

### **Setting Up the Chart**

*   **Symbol**: NQH2022 (e-mini Nasdaq futures contract)
*   **Timeframe**: 1-minute chart
*   **Delineation**: A vertical line is placed at 8:30 AM to mark the news release. The 15-minute high is also marked.
*   **Expectation**: Expect a run above the 15-minute high.

### **Walking Through the Price Action**

*   **Short Term High Run**: The market runs above a short-term high, creating a fair value gap. This presents a scalping opportunity.
*   **Daily Range Focus**: The presenter is focusing on the daily range, anticipating lower prices given the prior upward movement on the daily chart.
*   **Patience**: Even if it appears a move has been missed, it is important to remain patient as new opportunities appear.

### **9:30 AM Volatility**

*   **Equity Market Open**: The equity market opens at 9:30 AM, often bringing increased volatility.
*   **Initial Move**: The initial move at 9:30 AM is often *opposite* the intended direction.
*   **Sell Stops**: The market creates a low, then another low. This builds sell stops underneath, inducing traders to go long.

### **Waiting for Confirmation**

*   No trade is entered until the price moves above the key level.
*   **Initial Poke and Failure**: An initial poke above the high fails to create a fair value gap. There are no overlapping candles and no swing low taken out.

### **The Setup Forms**

*   **Higher High**: A higher high runs above both the short-term high and the 15-minute high.
*   **Break Lower**: Now, wait to see if the price breaks lower.
*   **Swing Low**: Identify the nearest swing low.
*   **Displacement**: If the price trades below that swing low, look for a fair value gap between the highest high that forms and that low.
*   **Candle Identification**: Identify candle #1, candle #2, and candle #3.

### **Entry and Stop Loss (Revisited)**

*   **Short Entry**: Enter short one tick above the high of candle #3.
*   **Stop Loss**: Place the stop loss above the high of candle #2 (more aggressive) or above the swing high created by candle #1 (more conservative).
*   **Risk Assessment**: Assess whether the risk is acceptable. If not, do not take the trade.
*   **Multiple Entry Opportunities**: Notice the multiple opportunities to enter short as the price retraces.

### **Trusting the Pattern**

*   The presenter urges viewers to trust the pattern and train themselves to recognize it as it forms.
*   **Counterintuitive Feel**: It can feel counterintuitive when a candle is initially green and bullish, only to reverse and create the setup.

### **Profit Taking**

*   Look for the opposing Fair Value Gap to take your profit.


Okay, here's the organized and refined version of the provided text, with all details, context, and nuances preserved:

# **Bullish Fair Value Gap Example & Trade Review**

## **Fair Value Gap Recap**

*   The fair value gap is defined by a three-candle pattern:
    1.  **Candle #1**: Establishes a high.
    2.  **Candle #2**: Forms the gap.
    3.  **Candle #3**: Establishes a low.
*   **Gap Range**: The range is between Candle #1's high and Candle #3's low.
*   **Short Covering**: If you're selling short, aim to buy back below this gap, ideally below 50% of the high-to-low range.
*   **Discount**: This area below 50% represents a discount, making it a potential target.
*   **Profit Targets**: Consider these areas for profit-taking:
    *   Equal Lows: Act as magnets for price.
    *   Sell Stops: Located below equal lows.
    *   Ideal Targets: These two areas.

## **Trade Example Walkthrough**

*   The following example involves minute candles.
*   **Short Entry**: Shorting occurred here, or potentially on the first candle.
*   **Time in Trade**:
    *   Entry: Minute 1
    *   Duration: Approximately 11 minutes
    *   Candles: Roughly 60 candles
*   **Profit Potential**: This duration can represent over a thousand dollars in profit. The presenter relates it to the length of time it might take someone to smoke a cigarette.

## **Trusting the Bias and Managing False Moves**

*   **Upsetting Traders**: The market often makes moves intended to shake out traders.
*   **Tight Stop Losses**: Aggressive trailing stop losses can be prematurely triggered.
*   **Anticipated Move**: This can happen right before a significant move lower.
*   **Target Area**: Focus on the 14680 area.

## **Stop Management & Partial Profits**

*   **Weathering Pullbacks**: Even with pullbacks, your initial stop loss remains in place.
*   **Quench Desire to Roll Stop**: Using the first partial to resist the urge to move your stop.
*   **Trailing Stop**:
    *   Wait: Roll your stop *after* a significant intermediate-term low is taken out.
    *   Rationale: Premature moves risk being stopped out.
*   **Intermediate Term Low**: This low, significant on a 1-minute chart, represents an intermediate-term price swing.
*   **Profit Target**: This point also acts as a final target for covering shorts initiated higher.

## **Price Level Example**

*   **Rough Price**: 14,800 (for easy math).
*   **Calculations**:
    *   100 handles down: 14,700.
    *   Target: 14,680.
*   **Move Size**: A 120-handle move is considered significant.
*   **Model Used**: All of this action is using the concepts taught in this model.

## **TradingView Replay & Paper Trading Account**

*   **Replay Button**: The presenter states this is the first time he’s ever used the replay function in TradingView.
*   **Paper Trading Account**: The presenter refers to the "paper trading account".
*   **Time**: A shorter position was implemented at the shown time.
*   **Entry Details**:
    *   Two mini contracts were sold short at 14,792.5.
    *   Based on the fair value gap strategy.
*   **Exit Details**:
    *   First Partial: Taken at 14,675.
    *   Limit Order: Placed at 14,647.

## **Trade Logic & Results**

*   **Logic**: The presenter reviews the logic of getting short, with the aim of the sell stops below the equal lows.
*   **Pattern Confirmation**: This trade is another example of the concepts taught playing out in the market.
*   **Order Coverage**:
    *   First Order: Covered.
    *   Second Order: Covered.
*   **Don't Focus on P&L**: The presenter urges not to focus on the high return (52% in this case).
    *   Not a Guarantee: This is not presented as a typical result.
    *   Focus on Process: Instead, concentrate on practicing the logic.

## **Fibonacci Retracement Example**

*   **High to Low Range**: Revisiting the idea of measuring the range from high to low.
*   **Wish for Earlier Knowledge**: "Man, I tell you I wish I had this stuff and I was coming up god coming in here for free".
*   **Fibonacci Tool**: Applying a Fibonacci retracement to the range.
*   **Equilibrium**: The 50% level represents equilibrium.
*   **Discount Area**: Below 50% is considered a discount.
*   **Fair Value Gap Target**: The smaller fair value gap within the range becomes a target.
*   **Internal Range Liquidity**: This gap is *internal* because it's within the larger high-low range.
*   **External Range Liquidity**: Sell stops below the lows are *external*.
*   **Trade Management**: Aim for partials at internal liquidity and final targets at external liquidity.
*   **Simplicity**: The trading logic is described as simple.

## **Closing Remarks & Ongoing Mentorship**

*   **Potential Confusion**: It is acknowledged that some viewers may still have questions, especially those new to charting.
*   **Practicing and Following Along**: The presenter claims that it will help, and this is an ongoing mentorship.
*   **Bite-Sized Pieces**: Information is given in small segments to aid comprehension.
*   **Pattern Repetition**: Examples show consistent patterns forming at similar times each day, performing as taught.
*   **Model Validation**: This is presented as a valid, executable trading model.
*   **Demo Account Focus**: Emphasis on practicing in a demo account first.
*   **Live Trading Caution**: The presenter will not instruct anyone to start trading live money.
*   **Experienced Traders**: Mentions that traders who have more experience have found success with it.
*   **No Credit Needed**: The presenter does not want credit, stating they already know the system works.
*   **Just One Model**: The presenter notes that this is just one of many models they use.
*   **Stripped-Down Version**: This is a simplified version of the model.
*   **Potential Benefit**: The presenter hopes viewers find insight and benefit from following the model.
*   **Alternative Content**: Suggests exploring other content on the YouTube channel if this model doesn't resonate.
*   **Next Video**: Ends with a sign-off, wishing viewers a safe weekend.

Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining all details and context while enhancing clarity and readability.

# **ICT Mentorship 2022: Episode 7 - Daily Bias and Consolidation Hurdles**

## **Introduction**

Welcome back, folks! This is the seventh episode of the **ICT mentorship on YouTube for 2022**. This lecture will focus on **daily bias** and navigating **consolidation hurdles**.

*   **Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8-z91acgG4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8-z91acgG4)

## **Daily Chart Analysis: NASDAQ**

We will be analyzing the **daily chart for the NASDAQ**.

*   Using TradingView, select the **NASDAQ continuous contract** for clean candle representation, avoiding "spotting".
*   Initial observation: Price runs, taking out **buy-side liquidity** (relative equal highs).
*   Following this run, price breaks below a swing low.
*   This creates a potential trade setup:

    *   Trade up into the fair value gap created after the swing low break.
    *   Target: Low-to-High midpoint.
    *   Alternative Targets: Old Low (sell-side liquidity), aim for that area or even lower.

### **Important Considerations**

*   While analyzing "cherry-picked" old moves is a learning method, consider the broader context.
*   Trading below the low indicates the removal of **sell-side liquidity**.
*   This suggests a likely retracement back into the range.
*   The "range" refers to the area between the High and the Low.
*   Notice the "energetic run" with multiple down-closed candles (1, 2, 3, 4) – indicative of strong momentum.
*   Focus on defining the High-to-Low range to understand the current market position.
*   After the sell-side liquidity grab, a retracement back inside the High-to-Low range is probable.
*   Price action moves to a "premium market" (above equilibrium), followed by a drop to a "discount" (below equilibrium).
*   A bounce off the old low, leading to consolidation around equilibrium.
*   Consolidation makes it challenging to accurately determine bias.

### **Dealing with Uncertainty**

*   Even experienced traders (like ICT) can find it difficult to establish a clear bias at times.
*   In such cases, demand more price action and information (or "intel") to inform trading decisions.
*   Pay close attention to market behavior right after the 9:30 AM New York time open.

### **Disclosure**

*   In ICT's paid membership, it was mentioned that a likely scenario was taking the price down to sweep a specific area.
*   Whether the price goes lower is irrelevant, but the expectation was for a bearish move from the current price point.
*   This forecast was made for **Tuesday, February 8th, 2022** trading.

### **Applying Daily Bias to Lower Timeframes**

*   The anticipated bearish sentiment will be important when transitioning to lower timeframe charts.
*   The goal is to demonstrate how to overcome challenges and conundrums encountered during live trading.
*   Utilize these concepts in a demo account to practice and refine your approach.

## **Teaching Bias Using the Daily Chart**

*   Market structure has shifted lower
*   Price Trades up into a fair Value Gap
*   Price trades down to here and here

*   Each day, anticipate lower prices, resulting in a **bearish bias**.
*   While the general expectation is for down-closed candles, intraday price action should be approached with the bias in mind.
*   Long positions should be considered **counter-trend** and therefore taken with reduced leverage.

### **Leverage Considerations**

*   Example: If the account allows a maximum of 10 contracts:
    *   Trading with the bearish bias allows for utilizing maximum leverage (without over-leveraging based on a fixed percentage risk – example: 3.5% ).
    *   **Disclaimer:** Do not use 3.5% risk. Risk less than 1% (0.5% or 0.25%) if inexperienced.
    *   High risk with limited understanding leads to "toxic thinking," poor habits, and fear of execution.
    *   Aim to be indifferent to results in the beginning by using a demo account and very low or no leverage ("de-leveraging").
    *   This is related to money management, but that is not the current topic.

### **Daily Execution**

*   From High to Low, expect a sell scenario each day to potentially short and buy back at a lower price.
*   Note the limited number of up days/green candles during the bearish trend (only one or two).
*   Algorithms are "spooling," meaning prices are expanding directionally.
*   Up-closed candles may represent losing trades; accept this as part of the process.
*   Continue looking for short opportunities each day.
*   Eventually, the market opens, trades below the low, and initiates a significant expansion move.
*   Price then returns above and closes near the high of the day or midpoint of the body.
*   This highlights the need to overcome the desire to be right every time and embrace imperfection.

### **Embrace Imperfection**

*   Accept the reality that perfection is unattainable.
*   There will always be imperfections in entries, exits, contract sizes, and even asset selection.
*   Don't focus on these perceived shortcomings; embrace the idea that you don't need to know everything or be right all the time.
*   **Being right does not equal being profitable**.

## **Daily Bias: A Quick Interpretation**

*   Use the daily chart to gauge the likely direction of the market.
*   Where is the price going to draw? Is it heading to an old high or an old low?
*   Maintain the bias until the higher or lower price target is reached.
*   This is a simplified method for interpreting price action and determining daily bias.

### **Addressing Common Misconceptions**

*   Many traders focused on daily bias are actually seeking the "magic bullet" to identify the exact high of the day on bearish days (and vice versa).
*   They want to get out at the low, capture the entire move, avoid losses, and feel comfortable every day.
*   This desire for perfection is unrealistic; no one trades perfectly.
*   Embrace the "gray area" in the market where clarity isn't always present.
*   Experience helps navigate these situations and reduces fear, even in adverse outcomes.
*   Isolated losing trades do not invalidate a model based on sound logic.

### **Key Takeaways**

*   Utilize the daily chart to determine the likely bullish or bearish nature of the next candle.
*   Between the High and the midpoint of the Low-to-High range, anticipate down-closed candles and a bearish bias.
*   Long entries are possible but should be executed with reduced leverage.
*   Consider using maximum risk (e.g., 3.5% if comfortable) for comfortable bearish setups.
*   Once the price reaches the low or goes beneath it, expect a possible reversal or consolidation, leading to a retracement.
*   When the market consolidates around equilibrium, determining bias becomes difficult.

### **Responding to Market Uncertainty**

*   The solution is not to stop trading, but to rely on smaller timeframe intraday charts.
*   Focus on liquidity pools, targeting old highs and lows with surgical precision.
*   Aim for specific handle or point targets and avoid overstaying your welcome.

## **Lower Timeframe Analysis: 15-Minute Chart**

*   Transitioning to the 15-minute timeframe.
*   Establish the **8:30 AM** reference point on the chart.

### **Identifying Key Levels**

*   Looking back to the left of the 8:30 AM reference, the first low is identified and marked.
*   Select the extreme low (not an interior low within a candle) to determine potential liquidity points.
*   Consider the placement of liquidity: Above the identified low, OR above a previous level further to the left.
*   **Why this low and not another?**
    *   Look to the left and note the "relative equal highs."
    *   Retail traders perceive these as resistance levels, anticipating price rejection.
    *   The market proves this level by breaking through it.
    *   This forms the initial intraday target, with a secondary, longer-term target further back.

### **Applying the Analysis**

*   Price trades below the identified low, reverses, and begins moving higher.
*   A trade was taken on this breakout, not held for the subsequent high.
*   **Reasoning for not holding:**
    *   The midpoint of the High-to-Low range is just above the high.
    *   A small imbalance is present, suggesting buy stops above.
    *   A long position was taken at the breakout and exited at the high.
    *   Holding longer might create an unrealistic expectation of consistent precision.
*   More time and experience are needed to develop that level of skill.
*   **Problems with excessive backtesting:** Students often struggle to execute on the right side of the chart due to over-reliance on past data.
*   While backtesting is valuable initially, it can create a false sense of security or lead to analysis paralysis if the educator can't trade the live market.
*   Many students who have been trained using other concepts (e.g., SMC - Smart Money Concepts) struggle because they lack a clear narrative.

### **The Importance of Narrative**

*   This mentorship focuses on developing a narrative-driven view of the market.
*   What's the logic behind price movements?
*   It's not enough to simply see a low taken out and expect a move higher (or vice versa).
*   There needs to be a broader context and reasoning behind it.
*   This narrative was provided at the beginning of the video.

## **Two-Minute Chart Analysis: Homework and Application**

*   Why the two-minute chart?
*   **Homework:** Analyze the five-minute, four-minute, three-minute, two-minute, and one-minute charts.
*   The two-minute chart was used for today's analysis.

### **Examining Key Price Action**

*   The old low is identified, and price trades below it.
*   The **10:04 AM** candle is highlighted – focus on that candle's low price.
*   Stop-loss placement: Just below that low (possibly one tick).
*   Price action:
    *   Trades below the old low.
    *   Rallies above, but doesn't break the short-term high yet.
    *   Dips again below the old low, but not below the previous low.
    *   Then reverses and moves higher.

### **Identifying the Long Entry**

*   **What allowed ICT to go long here?**
    *   **Nothing was visible on this specific chart.**
    *   The signal was observed on the S&P.

### **Considering Potential Targets**

*   Note the proximity of the high to the previous high.
*   8:30 AM reference is positioned at that point.
*   What is the point of expecting to go above that? Not much
*   The desire should be to see some kind of protraction
*   Yes, the market went above that short-term high and lower than that low.
*   **However...**

    *   Price trades below, comes back up, and exhibits volatility and sloppiness.
    *   Eventually, the market rallies.
    *   The draw on liquidity will be located here
    *   The market took out sell-side liquidity.

### **Analyzing Internal Details**

*   Analyze the price action for details that support a run to the 44.95 level.
*   The screenshot of the two-minute chart illustrates this.
*   As previously stated, the market trades below the old low.
*   **Apologies for screenshot issues:** the screenshot will appear more clearly on your two-minute chart on TradingView

# **Analysis of Market Structure, Indicators, and Live Account Trades**

## **Identifying Fair Value Gaps and Market Structure Shifts**

*   **Fair Value Gap Identification:**
    *   Low C, then High.
    *   One candle up, the next candle is low.
    *   This creates a fair value gap.
    *   That's the run in here.
    *   Displacement low and displacement high.
*   **Market Structure Shift (Bullish):**
    *   Price trades up above it.
    *   Looking for fair value gaps:
        *   No fair value gap is immediately apparent.
        *   No fair value gap until after a move down.
        *   Price trades down into it at 10:36.
        *   That candle forms, creating a long opportunity in the S&P.

## **Comparing Fair Value Gaps in S&P and NASDAQ**

*   **S&P:**
    *   Traded below the old low.
    *   Took out sell-side liquidity.
    *   Shift in market structure (bullish).
*   **NASDAQ:**
    *   No fair value gap present at the same time.
    *   Started to see the NASDAQ turning.
*   **Averages Moving in Tandem:** These averages generally move in the same direction. The Dow is monitored (even though not traded) and the S&P is monitored (while favoring the NASDAQ).
    *   Volatility of NASDAQ is favored, even though some traders are fearful of the volatility.
    *   "I know how to trade it. I can work within that volatility because I know what I'm looking for. I know the signatures the algorithm is going to put out. So until I get these signatures, I have to wait or put leaders into the marketplace."
*   **Long Entry:** Took long position in close proximity to the order block at 14,505 (inside the order block).
*   **Order Blocks Disclaimer:** Order blocks won't be taught as much in this mentorship.
    *   Comments have been made about the lack of order block teaching.
    *   The teaching will be done in a specific way, and viewers must acclimate to it.
    *   Viewers can choose not to watch if they disagree with the teaching method.
    *   "I'm not taking suggestions on how to teach you."

## **Utilizing the S&P as an Indicator for NASDAQ**

*   If a fair value gap is expected to be a launching point for the S&P, and these markets generally move in tandem, a fair value gap is not needed in the NASDAQ.
*   The S&P can be utilized as an indicator.
*   Indicators are present even without being "plastered all over my charts like graffiti."
*   The logic, how the markets run for liquidity, and the candlesticks can be seen clearly.
*   "You need to be able to read the story of price and not the story of indicators."
*   S&P's low traded down into an old fair value gap in its price swing.
*   No fair value gap in the NASDAQ at the same time.
*   The timing of the S&P candle is used for the long entry on the NASDAQ.
*   **Trading What's Not In The Chart:** Hint, nudge.

## **Market Rally and Confidence in the Turn**

*   The market rallies and trades into a short-term high around 4496.
*   The high is swept, accumulates some more, then rallies even higher taking out that longer-term old high.
*   **Confidence in the Turn:** Based on looking at the three averages together.

## **Analyzing the Three Averages: Dow, NASDAQ, and S&P**

*   **Dow Futures (Top Chart):**
*   **NASDAQ Futures (Middle):**
*   **S&P (Lower End):**
*   During the decline in the NASDAQ and the S&P, the Dow was "sitting this one out."
*   The Dow was unwilling to make that lower low, where NASDAQ and S&P did.

## **Understanding Divergence**

*   This confirms an idea that was already established *before* price does what it’s doing in real time.
*   Already looking for a reason to go higher.
    *   Looking at an old low.
    *   Does it trade below the old low?
    *   Is there a shift in market structure that's bullish? (Seen in the S&P but not the NASDAQ).
*   "No evidence whatsoever was in NASDAQ this morning with what I'm teaching you, but it was in the S&P."
*   The Dow is utilized like an indicator but isn't "plastered all over my chart."
*   Looking at the relationship of all three averages stacked over top of one another.

## **Accumulation and Fingerprints of the Algorithm**

*   Looking at a period of time and an area in price action that may be undergoing accumulation for long positions.
*   Looking for "that little fingerprint of the algorithm."
*   The Dow's unwillingness to go lower indicates a signal.
*   Individuals looking for cracks in correlation are tipped off.
*   Correlation would be that they are moving lower together.
*   Cracks in correlation occur at a very important time: when the NASDAQ and the S&P are trading below its old low.

## **Turtle Soup and Runs Above Old Highs**

*   The concept of runs above old highs to set up a short position.
*   This sets up for Runs above old highs to set up a short position if you have the opposite of the conditions here.
*   If the Dow didn’t make a higher high where the S&P and NASDAQ did make a higher high.
*   By itself, it doesn't mean anything.
*   Narrative needs to exist as to why this would even form.

## **The Importance of Narrative and Stripped-Down Analysis**

*   Don't personally need to see this divergence because "I know what I'm looking for."
*   As a developing student, you may not have that experience.
*   For someone that doesn't have an affinity for reading price action naked and not using indicators, these are the best indicators.
*   Moving averages, stochastics, Fibonacci, and other indicators are not needed.
*   "The only reason why I'm pulling a fib up is to show you where the midpoint is."
*   Optimal trade entry is not discussed.
*   The analysis is stripped down to the core.
*   "It's easy. It's so simple. It better be easy enough for my daughter to do it."

## **The Dow's Unwillingness to Deliver Lower: Macro Perspective**

*   The Dow is not going down because buyers are coming in.
*   This is an unwillingness to deliver to that low.
*   A **macro** is something inside of an algorithm that prevents or enables the delivery of price.
*   "The Dow is unwilling to go lower here."
*   "By itself, it means nothing."
*   This occurs at the same time that the NASDAQ and the S&P went lower than that low.

## **Algorithm, Time, and Liquidity**

*   Algorithms run on time and price, not price and time.
*   Referring to time first.
*   Important factor of time: 8:30.
*   To the left, the first low.
*   Liquidity below that.
*   It trades below it here, then wait.
*   Is there a signal that allows us to hunt what is being taught on this mentorship?
*   There's a swing high, it breaks it there.
*   Market structure shifted bullish.
*   Look back through this price leg, there's a fair value gap.

## **Stop Loss Placement and Psychological Barriers**

*   "What happens if it goes down there and it keeps on going? That's what your stop is for."
*   New speculators and traders: Your infancy is getting in the way of sound logic.
*   Thinking there is a way to trade and never take a loss.
*   Thinking there is a way to enter the market and never need to place a stop because you're right.
*   "What you're saying is, I'm afraid to be wrong."
*   That's a psychological barrier that needs to be overcome.

## **Live Account and Trading Insights**

*   Discussing the live account and trades done this morning.
*   Arrived at the desk a little late.
*   Couldn't focus.
*   Had some expectations to see it go lower.
*   Told paid membership the previous night that a move lower was preferred.
*   Got a really sloppy opening, which is characteristic of the 9:30 opening.
*   Some people advise not to trade the 9:30 opening because it’s scary and has too much volatility.
*   "I actually don't mind it because I'm actually putting sometimes a order in to get a feel for what it's doing."

## **Context and Insights from Floor Traders**

*   If I just show this chart without context, people will armchair quarterback after the fact.
*   Context is important.
*   Learned a lot of things from a floor trader in the 90s who traded the S&P on the floor.
*   Picked up more insights from Larry Williams about trading the S&P, and also George Angell.
*   George Angell had a really interesting concept that was initially discounted.

## **Buying or Selling One Contract to Gauge Market Direction**

*   On the floor, traders would sometimes have a disconnect and wouldn't have a read on what the price is doing.
*   They would simply go in and buy or sell short one contract and just see what happens.
*   "For someone that doesn't know what trading is like, never traded with life money, or just now learning, that's going to be like, that's stupid."
*   If you want to know how the market's likely to deliver, put some skin in the race.
*   You'll have a greater feel for what it's doing when you put an order in.
*   It doesn't need to be a large order.
*   Only putting one contract in.
*   Can only trade one contract because of the equity in the account.
*   It's like 21 plus thousand to do one NASDAQ contract, and it's justified because of the volatility.
*   "You could be up or down $5,000 in a session, so you know discount brokers are not a Saving Grace."
*   An order is put in two times, arrived to the desk late, and wanted to dial in.
*   The surest way to do that is just to toss a contract in.
*   When that is done, it is to read what the price is doing against that order.
*   Not trying to pick a spot when that is tossed in.
*   The benefits of having that are significant: "It's like dropping a hook in water that you've never fished in. You test it. See if I'm getting any bites here."

## **Reading Price Reactions and Sacrificing Initial Runs**

*   Watching and getting a feel for what the market's doing once that order's in there.
*   Reading the reactions.
*   Not looking at the equity.
*   Not trying to get a tug-of-war sensation internally of making money losing money.
*   Watching how price delivers around that order.
*   Is it easily moving away from that order, or is it lethargically moving away, or is it completely running against it?
*   That immediate feedback loop that it gives you as a trader because you have something in there that's worth something, you're going to be more attentive to what price is doing and what you're familiar with with reading price than if you were just watching the charts paint the candles.
*   This is a limitation of learning with a demo account.

## **Demo Account Limitations and Larger Moves**

*   You can test the waters by throwing in a single contract.
*   If that contract is basically ran over, then your bias probably isn't in alignment with that order.
*   "If I'm trying to hunt the bigger move of the day, I will sacrifice these initial little runs."
*   Not doing it all the time.
*   "Remember where we started this video? We're in the middle of that range on the daily chart, so technically it can go either side of the the range and take liquidity."
*   "I don't know when going to sleep at nighttime and also when I'm doing videos earlier in the evening, I don't know where price is going to be at at 9:30 in the morning New York time the next day. I don't know that. No one knows that."
*   "So when I build a trading plan or idea around what I would prefer to see, I'm only"

# **Trading Insights: Market Reads, Live Account Analysis, and Contextual Understanding**

## **Gaining Market Insight Through Initial Contract Entries**

*   Using initial contracts at the 9:30 opening to gauge market direction.
    *   Based on pre-existing ideas and information relationships.
    *   Relationship to the 8:30 vertical line on the chart.
*   The outcome of these trades (profit or small drawdown) is not the primary focus.
    *   Missing the point if focusing solely on profit/loss.
*   **George Angell's Influence:**
    *   Drawing on writings by George Angell.
    *   Floor traders employing similar techniques.
*   Applying this approach to Forex markets as well.
    *   Seeking a better understanding of market dynamics.
*   **Importance of Real Risk:**
    *   A real risk is required.
    *   Demo accounts lack the necessary feedback loop.
    *   Demo accounts: Connections are only drawn when trades are successful.
    *   Demo accounts: When wrong, the trade is easily dismissed.
*   Context is crucial for understanding the strategy.

## **Entering the Market with a "Leader" Position**

*   Placing a "leader" position to assess market sentiment.
*   Uncertainty about market direction:
    *   Potential run higher for buy-side liquidity.
    *   Potential run lower to take out a low.
*   Placing two initial orders to gauge the market's intentions.
*   **Specific Trades:**
    *   Short position taken and covered.

## **The Importance of Context and Avoiding Misinterpretation**

*   Charts without context are susceptible to trolling and misinterpretation.
*   Explaining the logic behind the trades.
*   **Distinguishing from Latency Tests:**
    *   This is not latency testing.
    *   Latency tests assess feedback timing and slippage.

    *   Not limiting analysis solely to the NASDAQ.
    *   Incorporating the Dow and S&P for intermarket relationships.
*   Using consolidation periods to "throw a contract in there to see what it's doing."
*   Comfort with drawdowns, aiming to correct them.
*   Goal: No losing days, but acknowledging it's not a realistic initial expectation.
*   Two losing days (approximately) since the start of this account have been fixed.

## **TD Ameritrade Speed and Scaling Positions**

*   Testing TD Ameritrade's speed and handling of positions.
*   Assessing fill times and slippage.
*   More important as contract size increases.
*   **Profit and Loss Tab:**
    *   Balance: $13,926

*   Early aspirations: Saving $1,000/month to achieve financial independence by 40.
*   Contrasting with today's YouTube "gurus."
    *   Critiquing signal services and exaggerated claims of quick riches.
    *   Highlighting the unsustainability of such claims.
*   Consistent $6,000/week earnings.
    *   Not a large amount, but potentially life-changing for many.
*   Uncertainty about the market's continuous offering of $6,000 weekly.
*   Experience trading these markets for 30 years.
    *   Comfort with volatility.

## **The Value of Negative Trades and Informed Trading**

*   Negative trades provide valuable intel and insight.
*   Informed traders invest in gathering information.
    *   Investing in oneself for market knowledge.
    *   Going beyond just watching price action.
*   Acknowledging that losing trades can arise from flawed ideas, not just errors.
*   Context is essential when reviewing trading statements.

# Applying Institutional Order Flow to Forex Markets: Episode 8

## Introduction

Welcome back to the channel! This is episode number eight, where we'll be applying institutional order flow concepts to the forex market. This will be a quick overview.

## Chart Setup and Pair Selection

*   **Platform:** TradingView
*   **Data Feed:** **forex.com** (for forex pairs only)
*   **Example Pair:** **Euro Yen (EUR/JPY)**
    *   The speaker expresses dislike for yen pairs but uses it for demonstration purposes.
*   **Timeframe:** **Daily Chart** (considered a higher timeframe)

## Daily Chart Analysis: EUR/JPY

### Identifying Potential Patterns

*   **Relative Equal Lows:** Marked out.
*   **Market Action:** Price traded down through these lows, then created a run higher.

### Why the Speaker Dislikes Yen Pairs

*   Tendency for a "double return" to specific levels.

### Identifying Market Structure Shifts

*   **Swing High:** Market rallies through it.
    *   Absence of fair value in the first run-up.
*   **Drop Back Down:** Price drops back down.
*   **Second Run:** Price runs again, taking out the initial swing high.
    *   Two points of market structure have moved to the upside.

### Fair Value Gap Analysis

*   **Price Leg:** Examine the leg between the two swing highs.
*   **Fair Value Gap:** Present and price trades down into it.
*   **Result:** Price sends higher.

### Buy-Side Liquidity

*   **Potential Target:** Old high back is Buy-Side liquidity.
*   **Buy Stops:** Expected to be present whether the price trades there or not.
*   **Horseshoe Analogy:** Aiming for the "post" (target), even if you don't hit it every time.

### Candle Analysis: February 10, 2022

*   **Confidence:** This daily candle was likely to go higher.
*   **Reason:** Price went up, consolidated, and started another run into the highs.
*   **Relevance:** Even a failure swing above old highs can be profitable if there's enough range.

## Shifting to Intraday Analysis: February 10, 2022 (Specific Day)

*   **Timeframe:** Drop down to the **15-minute chart**.

### Identifying Key Timeframes

*   **Midnight New York Time:** Marked on the chart.
*   **New York Session:** Begins here.

### Focus Area

*   **Rectangle:** Use a rectangle to highlight the price structure and run that occurred during the New York session on the 15-minute timeframe.

### Dropping Down to Lower Timeframes: 5-Minute Chart

*   **New York ICT Killzone:** **7:00 AM - 10:00 AM** New York time.
    *   This is when New York session trades typically form.
*   **TradingView Time Setting:** Must be toggled to New York time.

### Refined Analysis on the 5-Minute Chart

*   **Market Action:**
    *   Market trades down.
    *   Takes out a swing low.
    *   Trades down below that swing low.
    *   Punches higher, going above a swing high.

### Fair Value Gap Refinement

*   **Valid Trade Conditions:** Swing low taken out, followed by swing high taken out.
*   **Fair Value Gap Location:** Present in the price leg.
*   **Entry Strategy:** Aim for entry on the upper edge of the fair value gap, with awareness of potential stabs below it.

## Expansion Moves and Target Identification

*   **The Challenge:** Determining how far the price will trade.
*   **Absence of Range:** The trading range is unclear.

### Using Fibonacci Expansion for Target Estimation

*   **Price Leg:** Identify a previous swing low.
*   **Consolidation:** Price drops down, creates a discount, and then retraces to rally.
*   **Fibonacci Anchor:** Anchor to the low of the consolidation break, prior to the run-up.
*   **Standard Deviation:** Look to the **-1 Standard Deviation level**.
    *   This is found in the OTE primer video on the YouTube channel.
    *   In this case, approximately 133.153.
*   **Outcome:** Price trades to the identified level and then receives.

## Session Trading (London and New York)

*   **New York Open Session:** **7:00 AM - 10:00 AM** New York local time.
*   **London Session:** **2:00 AM - 5:00 AM** New York local time.
    *   Look for fair value gaps to trade during this time.

## Bias Confirmation

*   **Euro Strength vs. Yen Weakness:** If your bias is bullish and this relationship exists, it will likely drive the EUR/JPY pair higher.
*   **Time of Day & Pattern:** Wait for the specific time of day and patterns being taught.

## Disclaimer

*   **Free Education:** All the necessary information is available for free on the channel.

# **2022 ICT Mentorship - Episode 9: Power Three & New York PM Session Opportunities**

**Video URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZLXnNiZm_s

## **Introduction**
Welcome back to the 2022 ICT Mentorship series. This episode, episode nine, will focus on **Power Three**, which consists of **accumulation, manipulation, and distribution**, along with trading opportunities during the **New York PM session**.
We'll be using the **NASDAQ e-mini Futures Continuous chart on TradingView** as our primary example.

## **Analyzing the Daily Range**
Currently, price action is contained within a specific range.

*   **Swing High:** Establishing the upper boundary of the range.
*   **Swing Low:** Establishing the lower boundary of the range. This low was chosen because it represents the most recent low after liquidity was taken out from below a short-term low. Price retraced back into a **premium** (above the equilibrium).

**Fibonacci Analysis:**
A Fibonacci retracement was applied from the range high to the range low to identify the **50% equilibrium level.**

*   Price below this level is considered a **discount**.
*   Notice how price traded down on Monday into a deep discount, but did not break prior lows.
*   The candle closed on Monday was indecisive, the body was basically absent, with the open and close prices being nearly identical.

**Monday's Close & Imbalance:**

*   An imbalance exists between the low and the high of Monday's trading range.
*   On Tuesday overnight, equity markets rallied into this imbalance.
*   This created a **fair value gap**, which was retested.
    *   **Lower Level:** The low end of the fair value gap on the daily chart.
    *   **Upper Level:** The upper end of the fair value gap on the daily chart.

## **Power Three: Accumulation, Manipulation, and Distribution**

This section focuses on understanding the general principles of Power Three.

*   **Bullish Scenario:**
    *   Opening price near the low of the day/session.
    *   Price trades lower, forming an important low.
    *   Rally occurs, creating a high.
    *   Closes near the high of the day.
    *   *Note:* Predicting the exact closing price isn't the primary goal. It is more important to anticipate potential fake moves, like a "Judas swing."
*   **Judas Swing:** A false move, typically seen during the London and New York sessions, initiating a move in the opposite direction.
    *   The instructor outlined a Judas swing in the community tab last week.
    *   The outlined swing, using the fair value gap, was off by just a quarter of a point of the low of that range, and that swing created the low of the day.
*   **Monday Example:**
    *   Price dropped down overnight.
    *   Consolidated.
    *   A slight rally occurred before the equities open.

## **8:30 AM Analysis**

At 8:30 AM, we observe the following:

*   Highs that appear to be **relative equal highs**, making them potentially "suspect".
*   A significant **imbalance** left ahead of 8:30 AM.

**Scenario:** If those highs are broken after the 9:30 AM open, price is likely to trade down into that imbalance and then rebound.

*   Price does trade up into that level creating the fair value gap's low end parameter.
*   After taking those highs out, the likelihood of coming back down into that area increases.
*   If price retraces back into this imbalance, it becomes a good candidate for a long position.
*   To the left of the imbalance are down-close candles, representing a **bullish order block**.
*   The market trades down, hits this order block, and then an afternoon rally begins, followed by consolidation and close overnight.
*   The overnight move was significant, achieving most of today's move before the morning open.
*   There was a slight retracement after 8:30 AM, followed by consolidation at 9:30 AM.

**Relating to Power Three:**

*   For a bullish scenario: The market opens where it might trade higher, so the trader watches for a smaller move lower to consider going long.
*   If the initial move is missed, you can try to get long near the opening price.
*   8:30 AM is the opening price to watch.
    *   Did price go below it?
    *   Did it go inside the imbalance?
    *   Did it take out a short-term low?
    *   Did it hit an order block?
    *   Was it an optimal trade entry?

**Example Continued:**

*   The opening price had price trade lower than it, with it eventually going even lower later in the afternoon.
*   Price rallied, taking out relative equal highs and moving toward the upper end of the daily chart's fair value gap.

## **February 14th - 5 Minute Chart Analysis**

Zooming in on the 5-minute chart from February 14th shows price action within the imbalance, particularly its lowest portion, coinciding with the bullish order block.

*   The chart displays how price traded into it with one, two, three, four down-close candles, this would be a complete order block.
*   **How to Identify an Order Block:** Consecutive down-closed candles right before a price surge that creates an imbalance.
*   A high-probability order block would be one where your narrative or bias is bullish and you are looking for displacement (price running quickly higher). You mark out the down-close candles and anticipate a retracement back into that area.
*   It is important to note that these levels are not there until Monday's close.
*   The suggestion is to watch what happens when price creates a high, which breaks down all price action into a retracement back down into the imbalance.
*   The low of this candle and the high of this candle create a fair value gap with an order block and optimal trade entry. Even though it is sloppy, it is continuously driving higher.

**4:30 PM Observation:**

*   Price at 4:30 PM is like the close for this instructor, even though the bell rings at 4:00PM.
*   It helps determine what imbalance or liquidity pools are left.

**1 Minute Chart Analysis:**

*   Focusing on the 14140-14120 price area.
*   This area includes a small gap.
*   Price trades above a swing high, creating a fair value gap.
*   Price then trades down into it.
*   This is an afternoon trade (2:00 PM New York time).
*   This is inside the order block, inside the fair value gap, and inside a retracement of the fair value gap.

**Anticipated Outcome:**

*   This sets the stage for a market run-up into a higher retracement.
*   Whether this will be the closing parameter for a daily fair value gap is yet to be determined.
*   This is a likely scenario to go long and look for a run back up into this range, running the buy stops above.

## **February 15th, 2022 - Overnight Run Analysis**

Today's session (February 15th, 2022) started with a substantial price run overnight and during the London session.

*   The instructor would not have caught this.
*   **Rule:** Avoid chasing price after significant overnight runs, especially in equities.

**Big Overnight Moves:**

*   When there is a big overnight run or down, a consolidation is likely to take place shortly after.
*   *Note:* Sometimes price will just keep ripping higher or lower, and you will either miss the move or get lucky and participate in it.
*   This is the pattern the instructor typically looks for.
*   If there's a lot of range movement from 2 AM to 5 AM, avoid trading a lot and expect a lot of in and out perfect precision moves.
*   Wait for a real significant price move to avoid getting chopped up.

**Market Profile Example:**

*   When price opens at 8:30 AM:
    *   To the left is a high and a low.
    *   The lower low is a favorable reference because it has a fair value gap below it.
    *   Price is likely to trade down after a sloppy opening.
*   **Personal Study:**
    *   The instructor watches other YouTubers that trade equities market indices because they have different perspectives of the market.
    *   They are monitoring for price action and scenarios of price going one way or the other in their live streams.
    *   The instructor listens to see when they want to be a buyer, which means they are already hunting for a continuation of the overnight move. The instructor wants to see a low form first.
*   It is good that price went lower first creating a pseudo Judas swing, but there was not a nice low formed.
*   There were suspect lows, or relative equal lows, building up sell-side liquidity below them.
*   Anyone long overnight will jam their stop losses beneath those lows. This is the scenario to watch for.

**Equities Big Move Overnight Rule:**

*   If there's a big move overnight for equities (NASDAQ, Dow, e-mini S&P), avoid the New York session and wait until after lunch (1:00 PM New York time).
*   Anticipate the New York lunch lows being taken out or the New York morning session lows being taken out.

**Example (Continued):**

*   Price rallied up, but didn't take out relative equal highs formed ahead of 7:00 AM.
*   The range up there is the high end of the fair value gap due to the indecisive candle on the 14th.
*   It is likely that price might trade up into this Range High (resistance level).
*   If the price can draw down below that low initially formed in the New York session, there is a fair value gap to the side.
*   Then it can get up to that fair value Gap high or the boundary.

**Today's Price Action:**

*   NASDAQ drops down, taking out the sell-side liquidity and digging into that fair value gap.
*   The bodies of the candles respected that level back there, demonstrating algorithmic principles.

## **Trading Environment & Mindset**

*   The current market makes a run and goes into a choppy sideways pattern.
*   If sustained price moves are your goal, or you don't know how to operate in sloppy ranges, the instructor personally does not think this is high probability trading.
*   You can get chopped up, have losing trades, and draw your account down if you don't have control.
*   You can blow your account in these conditions.

**How to Avoid This:**

*   Don't chase the overnight run.
*   Wait for the market to give you a low that everyone will want to put their stop loss right beneath after it rallies above it.
*   It's even better when you don't have the previous high taken out yet, leading to liquidity being engineered and price being ran right down.
*   Price runs up, consolidates, creates a low, and starts to rally. Then, everyone is thinking they don't want to lose profits.


# **Additional Insights and Examples**

This section delves deeper into specific scenarios and examples to further illustrate the concepts discussed previously.

## **Retail Trader Mindset vs. Market Dynamics**

The instructor emphasizes the importance of understanding market dynamics beyond what "the books" say, particularly concerning stop-loss placement. He highlights a common retail trader's mindset:

*   **Retail Trader Logic:** Placing stop losses based on conventional wisdom, often near obvious levels where liquidity is likely to be targeted.

## **February 15th Afternoon Session Example**

The narrative for this day, February 15th, centered around the afternoon session:

*   Price action: Stocks traded below the lows, creating the day's low during the afternoon session.
*   Sell-side Liquidity: Liquidity was taken out into a fair value gap, leading to a rally.

### **Fair Value Gap Analysis**

*   No Clear Gap Initially: Although a distinct fair value gap wasn't immediately apparent, the existing conditions suggested a potential rally in the afternoon.
*   2:00 PM Observation: At 2:00 PM New York time, the market traded down into an imbalance, with liquidity resting below relative equal lows.

### **Anticipated Market Behavior**

*   Overnight Stops: The logic suggested that overnight stops had already been triggered, reducing the likelihood of the market revisiting those levels.
*   Focus on New Lows: Attention shifted to the day's low and the relative equal lows post New York lunch (noon to 1:00 PM New York time).
*   Imbalance Trade: After trading down into the imbalance, a complete retracement was considered unlikely, as the market wouldn't want to give stopped-out traders another chance to re-enter.
*   Sneaky Setups: The market tends to create sneakier setups for higher runs, taking out sell-side liquidity below relative equal lows before rallying.

### **Swing High Analysis and Trade Opportunities**

*   Swing High Break: A swing high was broken energetically, creating a fair value gap.
*   Short-Term Low: The market traded down into this gap, forming a short-term low, presenting a buying opportunity.
*   Missed Entry Scenario: Even if the initial entry was missed, another opportunity might arise as the market runs off and provides a subsequent entry point.

## **Fair Value Gap with Sell-Side Liquidity**

*   Enhanced Setup: The fair value gap is even more compelling when sell-side liquidity rests below a short-term low.
*   Entry Point: The low formed in this scenario can be used as an entry point (or minus one tick).
*   2:34 PM Short-Term Low: A short-term low formed at 2:34 PM, providing a specific reference point.

### **Limit Order Placement**

*   Order Placement: A limit order could be placed slightly above the low (e.g., 14,520 and a quarter or 14,528).
*   Stop Loss Placement: The stop loss should be placed below the short-term low according to established rules.

### **Risk-Reward Analysis**

*   Risk Assessment: With an entry point and a stop loss, the total risk can be calculated (e.g., 14.25 points or handles).
*   Example Calculation: Trading six micro contracts, risking approximately $85 to potentially make $300 (approximately a 3.5:1 reward-to-risk ratio).
*   Realistic Expectations: It's important to avoid expecting perfection; trades may experience drawdown.
*   Example Drawdown: Buying at a specific point might result in a nine-point drawdown (e.g., $54 with six micro contracts).
*   Mini Contract Equivalent: One Mini contract equates to $20 per handle.

### **Afternoon Setup Logic**

*   Fair Value Gap Baseline: Setups involving fair value gaps in the afternoon, combined with stop-hunting, provide a baseline for bias in the afternoon session.

## **Leveraging Reference Points and Sentiment**

*   Underlying Sentiment: Use reference points in conjunction with the prevailing market sentiment.
*   Missed Overnight Runs: It's acceptable to miss overnight runs; these events can provide additional insight.
*   Avoiding Morning Session: Big overnight moves often suggest avoiding the morning session due to potential chop and volatility.
*   Retail Trader Trap: Many traders chase the market after big overnight runs, leading to potential losses.
*   Chasing Cycle: This can initiate a cycle of chasing trades, which is detrimental in choppy market conditions.
*   Account Impact: In sloppy, choppy markets, over-trading can rapidly deplete an account.

## **Zoomed-In One-Minute Chart Analysis**

*   Swing High Break: A swing high is broken, creating a fair value gap.
*   Short-Term Low Identification: Note the short-term low formed after the gap creation.
*   Entry Idea: The suggested entry point is based on this setup, with sell stops placed below the short-term low.

### **Fair Value Gap Validation**

*   Not Invalidation: A move below the short-term low does not necessarily invalidate the fair value gap.
*   Candle Body Respect: Observe whether the body of the candle respects the fair value gap level.
*   Volatility Tolerance: In volatile conditions, allow for a greater level of imperfection in price delivery.
*   Stop Premise: Use the logic of the fair value gap as the basis for entry, and adhere to the stop-loss premise.

### **Trade Management and Mindset**

*   Stop-Outs: Accept that stop-outs are part of trading; it's just one trade gone wrong, not a career-ender.
*   Nimble Trading: If trading on small timeframes, trust the setups and let the stops do their job.

## **Bonus Setup: Additional Opportunity**

*   Missed Buy-Side Liquidity: Note that the buy-side liquidity resting above a certain level was not yet taken out.
*   Imbalance and Order Block: An imbalance occurred, trading down into an order block, creating another buying opportunity.
*   YouTube Channel Reference: This pattern is taught in the instructor's high-probability short-term trading or scalping series on YouTube.
*   Two Setups: This scenario presents two potential setups, leveraging both mentorship series content and free YouTube lessons.

# **2022 ICT Mentorship - Episode 10: Implementing Economic Calendar Events**

## **Introduction**

Video URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9ORTYmXwdE

Welcome back to the 2022 ICT Mentorship, this is episode number 10! This lecture focuses on **implementing economic calendar events**. This is essential knowledge for speculation and understanding market dynamics, especially before trading with live funds.

## **The Importance of Economic Calendars**

The economic calendar is something many traders overlook, but it's crucial for understanding market volatility. Ignoring it can lead to unpleasant surprises.

*   **Understanding Volatility:** Economic calendar events can trigger sudden surges in volatility.
*   **Preparation is Key:** Knowing what events are scheduled for the day helps you prepare for potential market movements.

### **ForexFactory.com: A Preferred Economic Calendar**

*   The speaker uses **forexfactory.com** due to its color scheme, which is a personal preference.
*   **Alternatives:** Other economic calendars are available and should provide similar information.

### **Impact Levels**

*   **Medium Impact:** Orange
*   **Low Impact:** Yellow
*   **High Impact:** Red

## **Understanding Market Timing and News Events**

### **8:30 AM ET: A Critical Time**

*   The speaker teaches students to start monitoring the market around **8:30 AM ET**.
*   **News Embargo Lifts:** Typically, many news events are released into the marketplace at this time.

### **The Role of News Events**

*   **Smoke Screen:** Some reports, speeches, or data points may be used as a smokescreen.
*   **Catalysts:** They can act as catalysts to drive price up or down.
*   **Buildup/Drop:** Often, price builds up or drops down right before a report, followed by a significant move.

## **Analyzing the NASDAQ Daily Chart**

### **TradingView Continuous Charts**

The speaker uses **TradingView continuous charts** for the NASDAQ analysis.

### **Power Three: A Brief Overview**

*   **Confusion Among New Viewers:** Many new viewers found the concept of "Power Three" confusing.
*   **Explanation:** The speaker offers a brief explanation and encourages viewers to search for the dedicated teaching on the YouTube channel.

### **The Most Requested Question: Daily Bias**

*   The #1 question the speaker has received over the years is "ICT, can you please teach me the daily bias?"
*   **Honest Approach:** This teaching aims to simplify the concept and provide the "brass tax" of understanding daily range formation.

### **Defining Daily Range and Equilibrium**

*   **Previous Episode Reference:** In the previous episode, the speaker outlined a high and low, defining the trading range.
*   **Equilibrium:** The 50% level of that range represents equilibrium.
*   **Premium vs. Discount:** Above equilibrium is considered the premium market, while below is the discount market.
*   **Scenario:** Market traded back up into the top end of the range between a specific low and high.

## **Fair Value Gaps and Market Imbalance**

### **Identifying Imbalances**

*   The mentioned low and high represent a **fair value gap**, indicating an imbalance.
*   **Discount Initial Trading:** The market initially traded in a discount.

### **Anticipating Rebalancing**

*   **Likely Scenario:** The market is likely to move back up to rebalance the imbalance before going lower.
*   **Trade Opportunities:** There are trade opportunities even when expecting the market to go lower.

### **No Signals Provided**

*   The speaker emphasizes that they **do not provide buy/sell signals** or specific stop-loss/take-profit levels.

### **Community Tab Insights**

*   The speaker plans to post chart observations in the community tab of the YouTube channel about once a week, encouraging viewers to study them.
*   **Real-time Analysis:** Viewers may miss the real-time event but can still analyze the chart using the provided information.
*   **Time Reference:** The speaker apologizes for often forgetting to include a time reference in the posts, acknowledging it's a work in progress.

## **Applying Premium/Discount Principles and Identifying Bias**

### **Short-Term Market Dynamics**

*   The market had been trending lower.
*   Sell stops were taken out below a recent low, creating sell-side liquidity.
*   A natural retracement occurred, followed by another decline.
*   A failure swing happened, not surpassing a previous high, leading to a breakdown.
*   This breakdown created an imbalance by taking out a short-term low.

### **Rally as a Shorting Candidate**

*   The speaker describes the market breaking below a short-term low, suggesting further lows may be targeted.
*   Any rallies or up-closed candles should be viewed as potential shorting opportunities.
*   The market traded up into the imbalance before plunging.
*   Consecutive Daily Lows were then taken out.

## **Power Three: Daily Chart Analysis**

### **Time Frame Focus**

*   The speaker focuses on the **daily chart** when discussing Power Three.

### **Daily Range Dynamics (Bearish Example)**

*   **Opening Price:** Consider the opening price of the daily range.
*   **Bearish Scenario:**
    *   The market opens.
    *   Rallies slightly.
    *   Goes down.
    *   Closes near the low.

### **Simplistic Overview, Profound Implications**

*   This simplistic overview of daily range dynamics is considered "exciting" because it forms the basis of understanding the market.

### **Daily Bias and the Daily Chart**

*   Understanding and studying the daily chart makes determining daily bias easier.
*   **Bearish Anticipation:** When bearish, anticipate each daily candle to open, rally (slightly or with a larger wick), then decline and close near its low.
*   **Bullish Anticipation:** The opposite occurs in bullish scenarios.

### **Not Every Candle Conforms**

*   Not every candle in a sustained price swing will be consistently up-closed when bullish or down-closed when bearish.
*   **Perspective is Key:** Don't overreact to single counter-trend days when bullish/bearish.

## **Evolution of Charting Techniques**

### **1992 Chart Example**

*   The speaker used classic open-high-low-close (OHLC) bars for trading in 1992.
*   **Age and Visibility:** Candlesticks are now preferred due to their clearer visualization of open/close relationships.

### **Open-High-Low-Close (OHLC) Bar Interpretation**

*   To the left of the bar is the open price.
*   Trades down, creates the low, rallies up, and closes near the high.
*   The speaker demonstrates a similar bullish OHLC bar then reiterates the likelihood of rebalancing.

### **Fair Value Gap Example**

*   A candle's low and a subsequent candle's high create a fair value gap.
*   Price can trade back into this gap, and often does.
*   **Bearish Bias Context:** The speaker hints that the bias is bearish, focusing on taking out lows.

### **Bearish Price Action Confirmation**

*   After returning to the top of the range, the price touched the fair value gap, balancing the range.
*   The movement of the open, rally, fade, and closure on the low is a representation of a larger trend.

## **Power Three: Components Explained**

### **Three Components**

*   Power Three consists of **Accumulation, Manipulation, and Distribution.**

### **Applying the Components**

*   Understanding these relationships on the daily range is crucial for market analysis.

### **Bearish Market: Accumulation of Shorts**

*   **Opening Price:** On a bearish day, the opening price and anything above it represents **accumulation of shorts**.
*   **Smart Money Entry:** This is where smart money and experienced traders aim to enter short positions.
*   **Potential Range:** Any point within this range is a possible zone.

### **Importance of the Opening Range**

*   The range from the opening price to the high is critical.
*   **Opening Range Calculation:** Subtract the range from the opening price, and you get the opening range.
*   **Relevance of Opening Range:** It is where fair value gaps, stop raids, and optimal trade entries occur.

### **Applying to All Shorting Candidates**

*   The concept applies to every potential shorting candidate.

### **Bearish Strategy Application**

*   If the day opens up and then rallies, it's considered a Judas swing.
*   **Opening Range Projection:** Project this range below the opening price to define the opening range.

### **Opening Range Use**

*   This gives a bracket to gauge market leeway below the opening price for favorable entries.
*   Power Three: Expected to open, rally above, then allow for shorting there.

### **Close Proximity Entries**

*   Opportunities often arise just below the opening price, referred to as **close proximity entries**.

### **Community Awareness**

*   The speaker acknowledges that new viewers may feel overwhelmed by the amount of information.
*   **Layered Understanding:** Emphasizes the need for a layered understanding and patient review of the content.

## **Additional Power Three Concepts**

### **Opening Range and Setups**

*   When bearish, whatever the high is from the opening price is projected downwards to determine sell setups.

### **Manipulation Phase**

*   The initial rally up is the **manipulation phase**, or the "sucker play."

### **Distribution Phase**

*   **Going Lower:** The price goes lower and creates the low of the day.
*   **Between Low and Close:** Distribution occurs between the low of the day and the closing price.
*   **Distribution Actions:** Smart money distributes their short positions during this phase.

### **Timing Considerations**

*   **End of Day Clues:** If price is heavily bearish near the end of the day (e.g., 3:30-3:45 PM), the low is likely formed.
*   **Sudden Continuation:** Be cautious of sudden continuations near the end of the day, which can be detrimental if caught off guard.


# **2022 ICT Mentorship - Episode 10 Continuation: Deep Dive into Daily Bias and Power Three**

## **Distribution Phase in Bearish Scenarios**

*   When the market is on the **sell-side**, it's beneficial to be a part of that movement. Generally, it occurs in the last portion of the trading day.
*   The market typically creates a low, and the area between that low and the closing price is where the **distribution cycle** happens.
*   Understanding the closing price isn't as critical as grasping the candle's highest probability in terms of:
    *   Forming an open.
    *   Rallying.
    *   Selling off.
    *   Closing down on its low.
*   Alternatively, understanding if it's likely to:
    *   Open and trade lower first.
    *   Rally.
    *   Close near the highs.
*   The speaker emphasizes focusing on whether the daily range is more likely to expand higher or lower than the opening price.

## **Key to Daily Bias**

*   Determining whether the daily range is likely to expand higher or lower than the opening price is **the key to bias**.
*   The speaker notes that one doesn't need to predict the closing price to be profitable, just the likely expansion direction relative to the open.

### **Identifying Swing Lows**

*   To determine the likely bias, look for a swing low:
    *   A low with a higher low to both its right and left.
    *   Formed by three candles.
*   The speaker advises against using Williams fractals as they use too many candles and cause traders to miss the move.
*   Once a swing low or swing high is identified, along with proper context, one can start "hunting" for opportunities.

### **Example Analysis of Swing Low Formation**

*   Following a swing low, if the very next candle opens, trades lower, and then rallies back up to close near the highs, it signals a change.
*   When a candle has significant movement below the opening price after a swing low formation, it indicates something has occurred.
*   The speaker highlights that the subsequent candle/bar didn't go lower than the previous one.
*   The rally and close near the high on that candle supports the identified swing low.
*   This is because it didn't take out the lower low in the middle between the adjacent lows, which is the lowest low of the three candles.

## **Anticipating Market Movements and Fair Value Gaps**

*   Following the swing low example, the next day features a significant washout from the open, trading down before closing on the high.
*   The speaker anticipates the market moving into a specific area (a fair value gap).
*   The daily bias is likely to be bullish, meaning the market will do the opposite of the bearish pattern.

### **Bullish Scenario**

*   The market will open near the low and then rally and expand higher.
*   The speaker emphasizes that it doesn't necessarily need to close on the high; the key is to open and begin rallying into the target area.

### **Market Retracement and Discount**

*   If the market retraces back down into a prior run, consider the equilibrium (50% level) of the high-to-low range.
*   The market will likely go below equilibrium to offer a discount.
*   With a bullish bias, the expectation is for the market to open near the low and expand higher.
*   This aligns with **Power Three**: accumulation of longs at the low, followed by a rally higher.

## **Power Three in Action: Accumulation, Manipulation, Distribution**

*   The speaker illustrates examples of Power Three, noting:
    *   Accumulation of longs near the low.
    *   Rallying and closing high on the daily range.
*   After consecutive days of this pattern, a small range may form, but the underlying function of Power Three remains.
*   The market might open, trade down, accumulate longs, and then trade higher.
*   After taking out a short-term high, the market might experience a retracement lower or consolidation.
*   This process continues with Power Three consistently delivering for accumulation of longs.

### **Potential Losing Trades**

*   The speaker acknowledges that there will be days where losses occur.

### **Relative Equal Highs and Buy-Side Liquidity**

*   Relative equal highs indicate stops resting above, representing buy-side liquidity.
*   If the market has already taken out sell stops below, and continues to prove that it’s going higher, the next target is likely above those highs.

## **Maintaining Bias and Market Analysis**

*   Until the market reaches the buy-side liquidity target, traders should anticipate the opposite of a bearish pattern:
    *   An open near the low.
    *   A close on the high.
*   This represents Power Three: accumulation of longs and distribution of longs at the close.
*   Indecisive candles may occur, but the overall bias remains until proven otherwise.
*   Traders should continue looking for buys, even if they experience losing trades, without abandoning the bullish bias until the highs are cleared.
*   After clearing the highs, the market needs to be re-evaluated to determine if it wants to continue running higher.

### **Market Acceleration and Fair Value Gaps**

*   In a sustained bullish trend, the market expands and accelerates higher each day.
*   Traders should seek longs, looking for opportunities where the market opens near the low, trades below the opening slightly, then rallies and closes near the high.
*   Conversely, the speaker references an imbalance and fair value gap, emphasizing what happens after the market trades up into it.

## **Switch to Bearish Bias**

*   Once the market trades into a fair value gap, the expectation is for it to trade back lower.
*   Traders should look for the bearish pattern:
    *   Open.
    *   Rally (accumulation of shorts).
    *   Distribution at the lows.
*   The shorts accumulated above or at the opening price are distributed.

### **Bearish Candle Analysis**

*   The open rallies up to facilitate short entries, then trades down and closes on the low, mirroring the initial bearish pattern.

### **Potential Losses and Sell-Side Targets**

*   The speaker acknowledges that the market may not always deliver the expected pattern, resulting in potential losses.
*   The next likely target becomes the sell-side.

### **Evolving Market Dynamics**

*   The market may exhibit patterns of:
    *   Open, rally, close down on the low.
    *   Open, sell-off.
*   Eventually a point comes where the market overlaps and then a key reversal occurs.
*   Back-and-forth price action can be challenging.

## **Power Three: Applying Bias to Daily Range**

*   The speaker stresses that using candlesticks it is easier to visualize, he teaches how to adapt and apply the function of Power Three as a way of developing trading bias.

### **Daily Range Commitment**

*   Traders must learn to hold positions to the close if they want to participate in sustained moves within the daily ranges.
*   The speaker highlights a recent move as an example.
*   Some individuals identified fair value gaps indicating a bullish move, but the speaker clarifies that the bias is not bullish, but bearish, as the market has already traded to the top end of that fair value gap and is likely to go lower.

### **Sell-Side Liquidity**

*   The market is likely to take out sell-side liquidity.

## **Lower Timeframe Analysis: Fair Value Gaps and Market Structure**

*   Dropping down to an hourly chart and analyzing a fair value gap:
    *   The speaker references annotations from a previous episode.
    *   The market trades down, finds support at the low end of the fair value gap, rallies back up to the high end, and then breaks right before midnight on the 17th.
    *   Consolidation occurs, followed by a trade back up into what?
        *   What is this? What is this right here? It's a fair value gap. Price goes up rebalances that. There
    *   This rebalancing occurs overnight during the European London session.

### **Model Application Across Sessions**

*   The same model can be used in the Asian session, although the movement is typically limited.
*   It can also be traded in the London close and the New York open.
*   Enormous moves are possible with a strong understanding of daily bias.
*   Traders may experience give and take, such as rebalancing and consolidation before a significant move triggered by news events.

## **Fine-Tuning Entries: 15-Minute Time Frame and Imbalances**

*   Examining a 15-minute time frame chart, the speaker addresses an imbalance.

### **Paint Roller Analogy for Market Efficiency**

*   The speaker revisits the paint roller analogy:
    *   If all downward movement were condensed into a single candle, there would be porous places in prices where the market wasn't efficiently offered for buyers.
    *   An efficient market will see the price move back up and overlap those areas.
    *   Just as a painter applies paint evenly with back-and-forth strokes, the market revisits these areas to achieve even distribution.

### **Chart Interpretation**

*   The background of the chart represents the wall.
*   Each candle represents a paint roller.
*   Long, drawn-out candles indicate a strong tendency for the price to go back up and overlap that entire range.

### **Fair Value Gaps and Displacement**

*   The market drops down, creating a fair value gap and taking out lows, resulting in displacement.
*   An order can be placed to go short.

### **Risk Management and Losing Trades**

*   The speaker cautions that losses are inevitable, despite this setup.
*   Noting that there is no silver bullet that removes losing trades and losing trades are part of the process of learning to trade.

### **Statistical Odds and Probabilities**

*   The speaker emphasizes providing tools and processes to help determine the most likely scenario.
*   Traders should work those statistical odds with sound money management.

## **Power Three Application on the 15-Minute Chart**

*   The morning session starts before 8:30 with a rally up, followed by a break lower.

### **Linking Daily Chart and Lower Timeframes**

*   Referring back to Power Three (accumulation, manipulation, and distribution) within the daily range, the speaker relates it to the 15-minute chart.
*   If trading near the high end of the fair value gap on the daily chart, a specific Power Three formation is expected:
    *   Open
    *   Rally (create the high of the day).
    *   Sell-off.
    *   Close near the low.

### **Bias Confirmation**

*   This bias is expected because the market worked the upper end of the fair value gap on the daily chart, and there were multiple bearish shifts in market structure.
*   This strengthens the probability of a down-close day.
*   The speaker mentions that a close to the low is not needed, just needs movement.

### **Midnight Opening Price Analysis**

*   The midnight New York opening price represents the opening of Power Three on the daily chart.
*   The market opens and trades above the opening, similar to the daily chart.
*   One might consider selling short at that point.
*   The market delivers the downstroke.

### **Counter-Intuitive Trading**

*   When the market is rallying upwards, it feels unnatural to go short.
*   This is where studying old data, reading price action in real-time, and practicing are critical.

## **Practice and Screen Recording Recommendations**

### **Live Data vs. Replay Functions**

*   Practice for months reading the tape, studying price action, and watching the market.
*   The speaker recommends observing the live market rather than relying on trading views Market replay function.
*   If live data is not accessible, one can use TradingView’s replay, but live data is more beneficial as you can see the candlesticks forming organically.

### **Screen Recording for Enhanced Analysis**

*   If one has the means, invest in screen recording software like Camtasia (TechSmith).
*   This allows one to record the screen for extended periods and review the market’s ebbs and flows in real-time, capturing the organic feel of candlesticks forming unlike TradingViews.

### **Camtasia Features**

*   Camtasia is inexpensive and easy to use.
*   It records even when the screen protector activates.

### **Looking for Short Entries**

*   The speaker is looking at the opening price and then is expecting a sell.


# **2022 ICT Mentorship - Episode 10 Continuation: Advanced Market Structure, Risk Management, and Hypothetical Account Analysis**

## **Fair Value Gaps and High Probability Sell Setups**

*   Referencing a chart, the speaker points out a fair value gap, noting how the market rallies into it, creating a potential sell opportunity above the opening price.
*   He explains the process of identifying the appropriate price range:
    *   Measuring from the opening price to the highest high.
    *   Subtracting that range from the opening price to pinpoint a target area.
*   The analysis reveals:
    *   An initial sell-off.
    *   A second sell-off at the equities opening.
    *   An imbalance within the price action.
*   To project a potential short target, the range from the high to the low is multiplied by two, anticipating an equivalent move lower.
*   The speaker emphasizes that this is a consistently reliable pattern.

### **Importance of the 15-Minute Time Frame**

*   The **15-minute time frame** is highlighted as the speaker's "bellwether chart" and a core tool for intraday trading, day trades, and scalping.
*   He states that if forced to choose only one time frame, it would be the 15-minute chart due to its versatility.
    *   Swing trading
    *   Short-term trading
    *   Day trading
    *   Scalping
*   Even if traders prefer other time frames (e.g., the one-minute chart for indices), the 15-minute chart provides the necessary context for a "panoramic view" of price action.

## **Sell-Side Liquidity and Identifying Market Shifts**

*   The speaker directs attention to sell-side liquidity resting below relative equal lows on the chart.
*   He clarifies a specific price point (14381) on a candle, encouraging viewers to verify it on their own charts.
*   The setups are described as forming near the opening price, within the projected range from the high to the opening.
*   The speaker reviews the events:
    *   The market moves up into the daily chart's fair value gap.
    *   The market anticipates an opening and rallies, potentially reaching the high end of the fair value gap or a news-related formation at 8:30.
*   The market's upward movement before the 8:30 news release indicates that a "premium market" is being priced in.
*   The news event is likely to be used to drive the price lower, aligning with the bearish bias and expanding the price downward.
*   Short positions have been accumulated above the opening price, as evident in the price action of short-term rallies.
*   At 7:00 AM, the market rallies above relative equal highs, clearing an imbalance.
*   When two fair value gaps exist, traders should aim to trade within the initial fair value gap while allowing for potential stop runs into the second, managing risk accordingly.

### **Framework for Trade Structure and Market Structure Shifts**

*   The speaker outlines the framework for trade structure:
    *   A swing high is broken to the upside, taking out buy stops (buy-side liquidity).
    *   A swing low is then broken.
    *   The down-closed candles exhibiting strong momentum signal a shift in market structure.
*   The speaker emphasizes the need to recognize energetic, momentum-driven moves, distinguishing them from slow, meandering declines.
*   Absence of a fair value gap at this stage (on a 5-minute chart) is acceptable, as the speaker employs a top-down approach, checking multiple timeframes.
*   The top-down approach of timeframe analysis:
    *   The speaker begins with a 5-minute chart and decreases the timeframe until a fair value gap is found (e.g. 4-minute, 3-minute, 2-minute, 1-minute).
    *   If a fair value gap is identified on a higher timeframe (e.g., 4-minute), there is no need to analyze lower timeframes.
    *   If a fair value gap is not found through the 1-minute timeframe, there is no trade.
*   The speaker also clarifies, there may be continuation of a trade moving lower off of a retracement.

## **Refining Entries with Breaker Patterns and Multi-Timeframe Analysis**

*   The speaker analyzes a 4-minute chart, noting more defined candlestick formations compared to the 5-minute chart.
*   He looks for:
    *   Clean price action
    *   Clear candlestick formations
    *   Even distribution of price (or lack thereof, indicating a fair value gap).
*   A run above buy-side liquidity (after rebalancing) followed by a breakdown suggests a potential short trade.
*   The speaker expresses preference for a specific fair value gap, while acknowledging the potential for price to run higher into another imbalance.
*   Money management is crucial to withstand potential runs into higher areas of interest.

### **Breaker Patterns and Stop Placement**

*   The speaker references a **breaker pattern**, which he teaches in-depth on his YouTube channel: a high, a low, and a higher high.
*   When encountering a breaker pattern, the speaker anticipates the market will primarily stay in the lower half of the breaker candle (the down-close candle preceding the move higher).
*   The speaker describes using the breaker’s candle for stop placement.
*   The speaker highlights not placing a stop above or near the breaker.
*   He clarifies that the lesson on breaker patterns is already available in his free YouTube content.
*   A bearish breaker pattern acts as the support structure, influencing stop placement decisions.

### **Fair Value Gaps and Precise Entry Techniques**

*   The speaker identifies a fair value gap range (from the low to the high of specific candles).
*   Looking at the 4-minute chart, he notes the candle showing 8:28.
*   When price trades within the fair value gap, he prefers a simple entry: shorting above the high of a specific candle.
*   This is done to ensure participation in the move, even if it means potentially missing a slightly higher entry.
*   The ultimate target remains the relative equal lows at the 14381 level.

## **Discount Brokers, Margin, and Risk Management: A Stark Warning**

*   The speaker briefly shows an example using TradingView's paper trading module, showing short position entries.
*   The speaker acknowledges questions about trading with discount brokers and smaller accounts (e.g., $10,000).
*   He vehemently cautions against the idea of trading mini contracts with minimal capital (e.g., $2,000 or less per contract).
*   The speaker believes that this invites financial disaster.
*   He illustrates the dangers with a hypothetical scenario:
    *   A sudden 100-point move in the NASDAQ within a single minute.
    *   Potential for significant negative slippage, far exceeding typical stop-loss levels.
    *   Example: holding eight mini contracts, experiencing a 50-point slippage loss results in $8,000 loss in a single, rapid event.
    *   This scenario can completely wipe out accounts funded with only a few thousand dollars.
*   He states the absolute minimum account size should be $10,000, and ideally closer to $15,000, given current market volatility.
*   This is due to the potential for substantial intraday price swings (e.g., 8,000 in movement for a single NASDAQ contract).

### **YouTube Disclaimers and Emphasis on Education**

*   The speaker expresses concern about unqualified individuals providing trading advice on YouTube.
*   Lack of skill, improper risk management, and failure to respect market risk can be detrimental to viewers.
*   The speaker reinforces the value of learning proper risk management.
*   He reiterates that his teachings with the demo account are not trade advice due to legal reasons and that he is not a licensed trade advisor.
*   His continued use of demo accounts allows viewers to practice risk-free and learn to read price action effectively.

### **Live Account Transparency and Proof of Concept**

*   This year, the speaker has also been demonstrating strategies with a live account.
*   At the end of the year, the speaker promises to share the complete trading history of this live account, showcasing every trade from every day, week, and month.
*   This transparency aims to provide undeniable proof that the strategies taught work in a live trading environment.
*   This serves as a response to those who may doubt the effectiveness of his teachings, demonstrating their real-world applicability.
*   He makes it clear that the results will be shown after the fact, and not during, so that he cannot be accused of giving trade advice.
*   The speaker acknowledges that his teaching style may not appeal to everyone.
*   He encourages viewers to seek out alternative resources if they prefer different approaches.
*   His focus is on teaching viewers how to read price action while maintaining a realistic understanding of market risks.

### **Hypothetical Account Showcase and Discount Broker Scenario**

*   The speaker addresses a request from viewers to showcase how he would approach trading with a $10,000 hypothetical account, using a discount broker that allows for smaller margin requirements.
*   He mentions the challenge of framing risk and managing lot sizes within those constraints.
*   It took two weeks to find setups.
*   The speaker shares a heavy-handed short strategy, targeting the relative equal lows at the 14381 level.
*   He confirms that the TradingView account shown is real.
*   He emphasizes that it is not photoshopped; students in his live mentorship will witness the account's live movements, confirming its authenticity.
*   The speaker states he will log out and log back into the account to prove that it isn't edited in any way.
*   The speaker confirms this is not an MT4 server or a NinjaTrader that can be manipulated.
*   The slide shows all executions with both green and red trades on a chart.
*   The speaker points out three losing trades on the 14th and highlights that the day's trades are all displayed at the top.
*   The speaker confirms that it was a heavy Quant style short being utilized.


# **2022 ICT Mentorship - Episode 10 Continuation: Paper Trading Account Analysis, Risk Management, and Market Repetition**

## **Paper Trading Account Showcase**

*   The speaker transitions to discussing the results achieved with a **paper trading account**.
*   He emphasizes this is a classic scenario where "the guy shows you the results" but clarifies upfront that it's a paper trading account, explicitly stated on TradingView.
*   **Key takeaway:** The results discussed are based on paper trading, not a live account.
*   The speaker states: "This is all paper money."
*   He started the TradingView account with **$10,000** on **February 3rd** (two Thursdays prior to recording).

### **NASDAQ-Only Strategy and Discount Broker Simulation**

*   The speaker focused solely on the **NASDAQ**.
*   He clarifies he's not using other assets like Forex or bonds to artificially inflate the account value.
*   The objective is to demonstrate what can be achieved in two weeks with **$10,000**, simulating the conditions of a **discount broker**.
*   He emphasizes the strategies used are the same ones he is actively teaching.
*   The result is a hypothetical **5.82%** gain in two weeks, achieved through paper trading.
*   This is done with the perspective of hypothetical discount broker margin requirements.

### **Risk Management and Volatility Considerations**

*   He contrasts this with his current setup using TD Ameritrade (TDA), which requires approximately **$20,000** to trade one contract.
*   He prefers this higher margin requirement due to the current market volatility.
*   This allows him to trade without constantly worrying about margin calls or unexpected market events.
*   The speaker says he is “not worried about it” because he has plenty of margin and equity.
*   He anticipates potential black swan events (e.g., geopolitical conflicts) that could trigger significant market volatility.
*   His risk management is designed to prevent these events from "smoking" or blowing up his account.
*   The speaker guarantees "this account's not blowing."

### **Developing a Trading Model and Finding Your Niche**

*   The paper trading demonstration illustrates the potential for someone who has spent years developing their own trading model.
*   Profitability can be achieved before that point, but consistent success requires a refined approach.
*   The speaker encourages viewers to find their own "groove" and niche within the concepts he teaches.
*   This involves formulating a well-defined trading model on paper, covering aspects such as:
    *   Buy and sell criteria
    *   Stop-loss placement
    *   Stop adjustment strategies
    *   Contract sizing
    *   Conditions for avoiding trades on specific days
*   These elements will be covered in future lessons within the YouTube mentorship.

## **Addressing Viewer Expectations and Emphasizing Realistic Goals**

*   The speaker acknowledges viewers who express eagerness but feel they aren't learning enough new information.
*   He asks that viewers hold such complaints until the mentorship is complete.
*   He stresses the value of the information he's providing, describing it as "gold" that can enable viewers to develop valuable skills.
*   **Important disclaimer:** He does **not** promise profitability or a guaranteed six-figure income.
*   He emphasizes that price action is repetitive, making it predictable and comfortable once patterns are recognized.
*   He acknowledges that unfamiliarity with these patterns can be a temporary challenge.

### **Avoiding "Get-Rich-Quick" Mindsets**

*   The speaker cautions against expecting a simplified, formulaic approach to trading (i.e., "buy here, sell there, stop-loss here").
*   He says “if you think that way, just change this channel right now don’t even come back here, because that’s not reality”.
*   He stresses that real-world trading involves similarities with slight variations, requiring adaptability and pattern recognition.
*   He asks viewers to consider what they could achieve over a year, rather than just two weeks.
*   He thinks it would be impressive if they could do that.
*   He states that a 5.82% return over two weeks would be amazing if done with a live account.
*   Even hitting that kind of number a year over 12 months is amazing.
*   He clarifies that this is not what he teaches his students to expect and is not bragging.

### **Addressing Requests for Transparency and Demonstrating Concepts**

*   The speaker emphasizes he was sincerely asked to show his methods.
*   The speaker is showing a paper trading account because he's unwilling to use brokers with discount broker margins.
*   He understands that even with his experience, aggressive trading with high leverage can lead to losses due to volatility.
*   He is not afraid but respects the volatility.

### **Initial Margin and Exchange Rate Margins**

*   He addresses traders using accounts with exchange rate margins (approximately **$22,000** for one NASDAQ mini contract).
*   Previously, it was around **$17,604.13**.
*   He advises that increases in margin requirements by exchanges signal potential for significant market moves.
*   He cautions viewers to take note of big, monstrous moves.
*   If traders are positioned unfavorably, they could experience substantial losses.
*   Conversely, being correctly positioned during these moves can be highly profitable, like "winning the lottery."

### **Fair Value Gap Example**

*   Referring to a fair value gap example, he illustrates the potential profit from a move from **14,515** to **14,381**.
*   It is much more than 6.5 points, 20 points, 50 points, or 100 points.
*   The speaker suggests that understanding his teachings is like having an ATM machine in your hands, and he is giving out the pin numbers.
*   He is giving the viewer another digit every time he does a video.
*   Viewers must integrate these concepts and make them their own to truly benefit.

## **Avoiding Overconfidence and Maintaining a Realistic Perspective**

*   The speaker notes that many comments he doesn't post are overly positive and enthusiastic.
*   He appreciates the positive sentiment but warns against losing sight of the work required.
*   He advises against immediately attempting to trade live based solely on the information presented in the videos.
*   He mentions viewers who have tried live trading based on a single video and concluded the concepts don't work.
*   The speaker isn't trying to make fun of anyone but the example demonstrates the importance of proper execution.

### **Importance of Bias and Trading Models**

*   The speaker emphasizes the importance of having a trading model.
*   He mentions a bearish bias.
*   He stresses the importance of defining intentions before the market opens, including:
    *   Identifying a range based on the opening price
    *   Looking for setups within that range to align with the bias
*   He cautions against chasing trades outside the defined range, regardless of how appealing they may appear.
*   Discipline is crucial, as brokers are incentivized to encourage trading activity, regardless of a trader's success.
*   The speaker references the idea that it is easy and “even a pizza delivery boy can do it”.

### **Reinforcing Core Concepts and Long-Term Perspective**

*   He reiterates the importance of understanding bias and Power Three concepts.
*   He assures viewers that these themes will be revisited in future videos.
*   He emphasizes that what viewers have been exposed to are the underpinnings of what he and his students do.

## **Backtesting and Subconscious Training**

*   The speaker adds another lesson on backtesting.
*   When backtesting, viewers should write annotations, even if it feels like "lying" to themselves.
*   The speaker understands that trolls are going to love that comment.
*   This process helps train the subconscious to recognize patterns as if they were seen live.
*   Recording annotations, logging data, and reviewing patterns weekly helps reinforce understanding.
*   With bullish patterns, the goal is to see the opposite of this: Open near the low, close near the high.
*   Accumulate Longs, manipulate, get people thinking it's going to go lower, and then Ram it up higher.
*   Distribute the Longs near the close.
*   The speaker asks “what happens if it’s a down day, ICT?”

### **Addressing Fear of Losing and Paradigm Shift**

*   The speaker addresses the fear of losing money, stating that it's inevitable in trading.
*   Traders are "professional losers" who manage trades from the beginning, accounting for commissions and potential slippage.
*   Every trade initially opens as a loser.
*   The Trader turns losers into winners, but not every loser can be turned into a winner.
*   The trader has to manage every trade right from the beginning.
*   He emphasizes the importance of risk management and understanding that not all trades will be winners.
*   He explains that there's a shift in paradigm if one thinks they are going to always win.
*   He mentions that there is no way of doing that.

### **Candlestick Analysis and Risk Management**

*   Using candlestick analysis, he notes that in a bullish trend, each candle should ideally close higher than it opens.
*   He points out the limited number of down-close candles during a bullish run.
*   He uses an example to illustrate how a losing trade on multiple consecutive days shouldn't blow up an account if risk is properly managed.
*   He states “you are scaring yourself, you are overthinking things”.
*   He attributes problems to overleveraging and overtrading, which can be easily deduced with proper analysis.

### **Managing Expectations and Avoiding Rushing the Process**

*   The speaker cautions against overthinking and assuming mastery after only a few videos.
*   The speaker stresses that there is still a lot to cover.
*   The speaker thinks viewers are foolish for rushing into trading.
*   The speaker understands that it is empowering if you have never been in-used to it.
*   He reminds viewers that they haven't backtested enough or had sufficient time to build a backlog of experience.
*   He stresses that these moves repeat all the time.
*   The speaker encourages viewers to put feelings of missing out aside and have fun while learning.
*   He states “it’ll never feel like a job or a tedious task.”
*   He concludes the video, wishing viewers a safe weekend and promising to talk again next Tuesday.

Here's the organized and detailed breakdown of the provided text, formatted for clarity and comprehensive understanding.

# E-mini NASDAQ Futures Contract Analysis: A Hindsight View

**Video URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqw2bww93Zo

## Introduction

*   This broadcast is earlier than usual.
*   The analysis focuses on a hindsight view of a scenario previously discussed in the private mentorship group.
*   Mentorship is being taught on YouTube, eliminating the need to request access or provide payment information.

## General Market Overview

*   Examining the **E-mini NASDAQ futures contract for March delivery.**
*   Focus on an **imbalance** previously outlined.
*   The high of a specific candle served as a key reference point.
*   Trade occurred down to a **discount**, then back up to a **premium**.

## Dealing Range Analysis

*   **Equilibrium (50% level)** is considered within the dealing range (high to low).
*   The market traded from lows up into a premium (above 50%).
*   Failed rally above a specific high.
*   Broke back down below 50%, creating a **gap**.
*   The market retraced back into a premium (above 50%) and filled the gap.
*   This retracement could mislead traders into thinking it will go higher.
*   **The actual target is lower**, focusing on liquidity resting below.
*   Consolidation sets up another selling opportunity.

## Market Rebalancing and Liquidity

*   The market needed to rebalance first.
*   Spent three days in a range.
*   Then, it released downside attacks, targeting sell-side liquidity.
*   **Goal:** To trade into the sell-side liquidity resting below.

## Lower Time Frame Analysis (Hourly Chart)

*   Transitioning to an **hourly chart** for more detailed information.
*   Identified the high and low end of the **fair value gap**.
*   The market traded up into that gap, sold off, consolidated, and sold off again.
*   Live trades from yesterday, executed through TD Ameritrade (not a demo account), were shared on the community tab.

## Specific Trade Details

*   Explanation of the instruments and observations that factored into the trade.
*   Followed by a review of the account details.
*   The market rallied and took out a short-term high on Friday.
*   Then, started the breakdown.
*   Watching overnight, hoping it wouldn't take out the low before morning.

## Ideal Scenario vs. Reality

*   Desired scenario: Trade up, take the high out, consolidate, then run below a short-term low, setting up a short opportunity with a potential re-entry.
*   Reality: Trading stopped at 1 PM on Monday (bank holiday) after moving aggressively lower.
*   Strong feeling of a gap down below.
*   Beautiful gap lower and run immediately occurred.

## Execution Challenges

*   Looking at the 13590 - 13586 level in real-time.
*   Couldn't reach the screen fast enough to close at the ideal level.
*   Didn't want to use a limit order to avoid limiting potential profits.
*   Left it open-ended to see how far it would reach.

## Trade Result

*   Trade closed at **13612.25**.
*   Entry: **13858.25**.
*   246 handles (246 x 4 = total tick value)

## 15-Minute Time Frame

*   Run on Friday's high led to a breakdown.
*   Fill occurred at 10:33 AM (right in that candle).
*   Trading short within that specific candle.
*   Further details about why that trade was executed.
*   Live account log-in to be shown.

## 5-Minute Chart: Deeper Dive into Imbalances

*   The rally up was interpreted as a **Judas Swing** in the morning.
*   At 8:30 AM, the market started to run higher.
*   The desired action was to go short at the opening of that candle.
*   8:30 AM candle opened at **13798.50**.
*   Preferably, going short above that price.
*   Anticipating further weakness.

## Clarification on Opening Price References

*   Confusion among viewers regarding the mention of two different opening prices:
    *   **Midnight:** Used for the entire daily range.
    *   **8:30 AM:** Used for the morning session.
*   A market structure lesson on Thursday to further clarify this.

## Bearish Sentiment and Order Block Analysis

*   8:30 AM opening price.
*   Bearish outlook, anticipating a move below the green level (old daily low).
*   Expecting a fake rally to lure in traders chasing higher prices.
*   Those who don't understand order blocks might see a down-closed candle and buy, thinking it's a bullish order block.
*   But the real context is the imbalance.
*   Looking to operate inside that range for a short.
*   Aware of volatility, allowing for candles to slightly deviate.
*   Focus on the bodies of the candles supporting the idea, less concerned about wicks.

## 4-Minute Chart: Refining the Entry

*   The imbalance and fair value gap on the five-minute chart are shown across two candles.
*   Trade occurs right in that candle, going short at **10:33 AM**.

## 3-Minute Chart: Precision and Market Structure Confirmation

*   The market trades up, working inside the imbalance.
*   At **10:33 AM**, as it hits the upper end of the fair value gap and starts to move away, entry is made to go short.
*   The decision is based on multiple factors, not just lower lows and lower highs.

## Key Market Structure Elements

*   **Swing High Analysis:**
    *   High with a lower high on either side.
    *   Long-term intraday (on a 3-minute chart)
    *   Intermediate-term high

## Factors Influencing the Trade Decision

*   Bearish market because the draw on liquidity is down below.
*   All fluctuations are telling exactly what it will do.
*   The swing high is an intermediate-term swing high.
*   Go short real close to this high because it's likely to break.
*   At 10:33, the market formed a high with a lower high on either side.

## The Importance of Context

*   Market structure is behind the trade.
*   "Oh, he's just looking at lower lows, lower highs" is a simplistic viewpoint.
*   There are many more factors involved.

## Market Structure Techniques

*   The elements of intermediate-term short-term highs were learned from **Larry Williams**.
*   Specifically, his video course from the early 90s, *The Future Millionaires Confidential Trading Course*.
*   Requires going into the charts and actively identifying swing highs.
*   Those that believe they’re learning market structure incorrectly are setting themselves up to fail.

## Directional Bias

*   What you're looking at is a price chart with a directional bias (leading to a draw on liquidity).
*   Previously stated that the market would go below that green line.
*   Examine all swing highs and look for highs with a lower high candle to the left and right.

## Identifying Swing Highs/Lows

*   In the past, charts would be printed out, and swing highs/lows would be marked with a circle (halo).
*   Double circle for intermediate-term high.
*   Triple circle for long-term swing high.
*   Classify the level of high that is forming.
*   Don't just look for lower lows and lower highs; consider the nesting effect of highs and lows.

## Larry Williams' Influence

*   This concept was learned from Larry Williams in the early 90s.
*   Mentioned in his book, *How I Made a Million Dollars Trading Commodities Last Year*.
*   Recommended reading, despite some elements being considered "fluff" (e.g., moon phases).
*   The chapters on market structure and million-dollar trading concepts are essential.
*   Read annually for nostalgic reasons.

## Trade Confidence

*   Trusted this trade because a swing high was already in effect.
*   Knowing the likelihood of a candle not exceeding a previous high.

## Beyond Simple Patterns

*   "Not because it's lower lows and lower highs" - there's much more going on.
*   Avoiding simplistic descriptions like "support and resistance" or "buy the floor, sell the ceiling."
*   Avoiding the simplistic descriptions, those trades are being referred to in hindsight.

## Live Execution and Trusting the Model

*   Taking live trades, executing on them, and knowing why.
*   Not guessing or deciphering after the trade.
*   Knowing what to look for and waiting for it.
*   Learned by developing patience and trusting a model.
*   Only way to trust it is to go through back testing, look at all these price action moves and start classifying the swing highs and swing lows.

## Preview of Upcoming Lesson

*   The concepts discussed here will be amplified in Thursday's lesson on market structure.
*   Intended to enhance the understanding of market structure.
*   The importance of seeing.


# Deep Dive into E-mini NASDAQ Futures Trade: Context, Execution, and Lessons Learned

## Introduction: Trade Review and Potential Opportunities

*   Analyzing a recent trade and highlighting potential alternative entry points.
*   **Displacement:** Focusing on the market's displacement and its implications.
*   If the initial trade wasn't taken, a return to a specific level would present another opportunity.

## Alternate Entry Points and Fair Value Gaps

*   Why another entry is possible:
    *   **Swing High:** A swing high has been broken to the upside.
    *   **Low Taken Out:** A low has been taken out.
    *   **Candle High:** Considering the high of a specific candle.
*   If price touches that level again, a short position could be initiated.
*   Utilizing the imbalance and fair value gap entry techniques.
*   Aiming to get as close as possible to the important high already outlined.

## Optimal Entry and Understanding Market Dynamics

*   Waiting for the initial move after entering near the session high (8:30 AM).
*   Optimal Entry:
    *   Entering where it's an optimal entry.
    *   Not necessarily needing to get the absolute highest high.
    *   Understanding why the market should be trading away from the intended entry levels.
*   The importance of understanding why the market should move away from your entry point.
*   Hinting at a more in-depth lesson to be presented on Thursday.

## Confirmation and Patience

*   Waiting for displacement as a confirmation signal.
*   Once displacement occurs, the approach shifts to relaxing and letting the trade unfold.

## Abbreviated Session and Target Liquidity

*   Monday was a holiday, resulting in abbreviated session hours (closing at 1 PM New York time).
*   The market closed ahead of 1 PM.
*   Reference to a **"green level"** representing a previous daily low:
    *   Reviewing the daily chart from the beginning of the video for context.
    *   The target was the sell stops (liquidity) below this green line.
*   The market successfully attacked this liquidity.

## Ideal Trade Execution

*   Ideal scenario: Being short from a high position and covering lower after the market runs into the target low.
*   Taking profits and moving to the sidelines after achieving the target.
*   A large gap is likely to be rebalanced.
*   The market retraced, filled the gap, traded around the old low, and eventually consolidated.

## Avoiding Overtrading

*   Avoiding trading during the morning session after a significant market move.
*   Using a demo account to satisfy the urge to trade and prevent losses in the live account.
*   The goal is to prevent a nice win from being diminished by a losing trade.

## Mentoring and Personal Experience

*   Sharing personal experiences and lessons learned over 30 years.
*   Acknowledging that these are often the lessons people initially resist.
*   Emphasizing that the insights come from lived experience.

## Managing Impulsive Tendencies

*   Acknowledging the impulsive tendency to re-enter the market after a winning trade, driven by the desire for another "dopamine hit."
*   Recalling past experiences of significant account run-ups followed by losses.
*   The need for a supportive structure and recognition of achievements.
*   One of the mental hurdles you're going to have to contend with is knowing when enough is enough.
*   **Mental Hurdle:** Recognizing when "enough is enough" after making real money.

## Sharpening the Edge

*   Challenging the notion of constantly "pushing your edge."
*   Sharpening the trading edge by knowing when to enter and exit, rather than constantly pushing.
*   Expressing skepticism towards those who promote constant activity, suggesting they may be unprofitable gamblers.

## Market Bias and Trading Opportunities

*   Maintaining a **bearish bias** despite a recent run-up.
*   Equity opening at 9:30 AM after consolidation.
*   Identifying a "run on stops" after the market runs up, creates a high, and takes out the high again.
*   Nice selling opportunity.

## Fair Value Gaps and Liquidity Targets

*   Opportunity to attack the fair value gap between the low and the high.
*   Alternative: Targeting sell-side liquidity resting below relative equal lows.
*   Offering guidance on various trading styles and timeframes for students to choose.

## Trading Styles and Personal Strengths

*   Offering students the option to choose their trading style: day trader, scalper, intraday swing trader, short-term trader, or position trader.
*   Acknowledging personal preference for short-term trading and intraday opportunities.
*   Recognizing that position trading can be profitable, but doesn't align with personal preferences.
*   Focusing on excelling in areas of personal strength (intraday trading).

## Short-Term Focus

*   Excelling at short-term moves and quick parlaying.
*   Referencing a facetious demonstration of this approach in a one-minute video.

## Potential Downside Targets

*   Anticipating a potential acceleration downwards.
*   Key levels to watch:
    *   13,300
    *   Potentially 12,850 - 12,875 range.
*   Disclaimer: Not suggesting specific trades, but rather thinking out loud.

## Recap and Preview

*   Acknowledging that the lesson was "fast and loose" and promising a more structured market structure lesson on Thursday.
*   Reiterating the live account trade.

## Live Account Demonstration

*   Demonstrating the actual trade taken with a live account.
*   Logging into a TD Ameritrade account to show the trade results from the previous day.
*   Stating that no live trades were taken today, in an effort to show the real executions that are being done.

## Broker Adjustments and Trade Details

*   Addressing a seemingly negative entry in the account history (-$2755.55).
*   Explaining that this was a broker adjustment related to settlement timing.
*   The broker was reflecting a gain of $7675, which was incorrect.
*   Reassuring viewers that this is a common occurrence in live trading accounts and not an indication of "funny money business."
*   Showing executions from the previous day, including a scratch trade (small loss).
*   Describing one trade, where he got in a little too early, but was only ambitious.

## Trade Execution and Results

*   Describing a second trade, where he wasn't sure whether the trade would go higher or lower.
*   Highlighting the previously outlined short trade.
*   Holding the position through the gap opening after the 6 AM reopen.
*   The trade closed for a profit of $4,920, fixing the small loss from the earlier trade.
*   There were no commission costs.
*   There is the entry and there is the exit.

## Conclusion

*   Expressing hope that the information was insightful.

# **Market Structure for Precision Technicians: An Advanced Price Action Theory**

**Video URL**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GkQfdAXZP0

## **Introduction**

*   Welcome back, everyone! This is episode 12.
*   Today's lesson/lecture will focus on **Market Structure** for precision technicians.
*   Understand that this is an **advanced price action theory**.
*   Many questions and anxieties are expected, especially for those seeking to learn it all in one viewing.
*   This lesson surpasses even the content provided to my paid mentorship group.
*   The goal is to offer a fresh, in-depth perspective to enhance chart analysis beyond the retail view of market structure (higher high, higher low).
*   We'll be examining the **NASDAQ March contract for 2022**.

## **Applicability Across Markets**

*   For Forex traders: This methodology applies to **Forex, Stocks, and Bonds**.
*   The focus is on **price action**, and the speaker is using the asset class that is moving around nicely.
*   Feel free to apply these concepts to assets like the Aussie dollar or Pound/Yen charts.
*   The speaker will revisit Forex in future content.
*   Current focus is on the volatility within index futures.

## **Review of Previous Analysis and Current Market Conditions**

*   Hindsight confirms the speaker's prior price action analysis.
*   The analysis correctly anticipated a run below previous lows.
*   The analysis also anticipated a run and rebalance back into a fair value gap.
*   Global events (wartime developments) caused overnight excitement on the downside.
*   Price has moved back above a short-term low, but the speaker is unconvinced that a true low has formed.
*   The speaker *does not* engage in picking tops and bottoms, nor is this taught in the paid mentorship group.

## **Deep Dive into Market Structure**

*   The lecture will delve into market structure within a specific price area.
*   **Important Note**: The initial concepts may seem boring.
*   Patience, study, and homework (analyzing old price data) are crucial.
*   This video *will* provide insights and reveal previously unseen patterns in the charts.
*   This video will confirm or negate a price move

## **Addressing Common Questions: Selling Above Old Highs**

*   The speaker receives many questions via TradingView.
*   Due to time constraints, not all individual questions can be answered directly.
*   These questions serve as talking points for lectures in both this mentorship and the private group.
*   **Common Question:** How do I know if I'm going to sell above an old high? How do I know it's not going to keep going higher?
*   The answer lies in understanding underlying **Market Structure**.
*   Trust in these factors must be developed through personal learning and experience.
*   The learning curve varies; trust the process, and you will develop at the exact time you should.
*   **Candlesticks** can be manipulated to support any narrative, but understanding their likely hints is key.
*   The lecture will provide clues to decipher these hints.

## **Analyzing Specific Price Action**

*   The analysis will focus on a fair value gap on the daily chart.
*   The timeframe for the analysis is the 1-hour chart.
*   Market structure will be outlined using terms: **Long-Term High, Long-Term Low, Short-Term High, Short-Term Low, Intermediate-Term High, Intermediate-Term Low**.
*   Focus is not just on simple higher high, higher low patterns indicative of an uptrend.
*   The focus is:
    *   **Buy-Side Liquidity:** Does the market have a reason to go up for buy-side liquidity (buy stops)?
    *   **Rebalancing:** Is it likely to go up to rebalance an imbalance (fair value gap)?
    *   **Sell-Side Liquidity:** Is it likely to go lower to sweep out short-term lows for sell-side liquidity (sell stops)?
    *   **Rebalancing (Downside):** Is it likely to go down to rebalance an old imbalance or fair value gap below market price?

## **Core Question Before Chart Analysis**

*   **Primary Question:** What is the current market narrative? What is it likely to be doing right now?
*   The speaker disregards patterns, harmonic concepts, Elliot waves, ratios, and anything attributed to a retail mindset *except* for the questions above.
*   The speaker does not care about any of the retail indicators.

## **Developing Bias and Understanding Daily Range**

*   **Most Frequent Question:** "Teach me bias." Where is the market going next? What is the next draw on liquidity?
*   The daily range will not always conform to a bullish or bearish trend immediately from the opening.
*   Consolidation can occur, leading to potential losses for those holding onto trades based on an initial bullish idea.
*   The ideas presented in this lecture will aid in identifying when an idea is likely inaccurate.
*   Receptiveness to clues given by price is essential.

## **Importance of Clean Charts and Internalization**

*   The speaker abandoned indicators due to their obscuring nature.
*   Avoid "lipstick" (anything on the charts that covers up candles or distracts attention).
*   The charts presented visually show internalizing price structure and fractals.
*   The speaker analyzes highs and the relationships between swing highs and swing lows, coming to a conclusion rapidly.
*   Analysis is done swing by swing.
*   The speaker is highly confident the market will go lower because the daily chart showed it.

## **Avoiding "Hindsight Bias" Accusations**

*   The speaker is teaching something already proven; the directional move was called *before* it happened.
*   This avoids the common pitfall of appearing smart by analyzing past events.
*   The lecture will outline what the speaker looked for *at the time* to develop confidence in the downward movement.

## **Specific Price Action Analysis: Fair Value Gap**

*   Price traded up to the high end of a fair value gap.
*   The speaker will outline exactly what was analyzed for each price point
*   Reference points:
    *   High end of fair value gap: Specified candle low on the daily chart.
    *   Low end of fair value gap: Specified candle high on the daily chart.
*   The analysis is conducted on an hourly chart.
*   Once price broke down from the high of the fair value gap, it traded back down into a specific candlestick's high.
*   The market became range-bound.

## **Long-Term High and Its Significance**

*   Given the daily chart's influence, minor lower timeframe swings are subordinate.
*   This establishes the current high as a **Long-Term High**.
*   The speaker does not expect this high to be breached.
*   If the high *is* broken, the speaker's daily analysis is likely incorrect.
*   Breaking the high demands further information gathering by studying more price action.
*   If a trade is active, admitting the error and managing risk (accepting a stop-out) is necessary.
*   A losing transaction does *not* indicate a flawed model or a failed trader, but that the particular transaction was not a profitable one.
*   As long as price remains below this high, the Long-Term High thesis remains valid.
*   The high is essentially a "higher timeframe resistance level" (using retail terminology).
*   The aim is to move beyond simplistic support/resistance concepts.

## **Analyzing Price Action Within the Fair Value Gap**

*   Price trades down to the discount level of the low end of the fair value gap and finds support.
*   It rallies back up but *fails* to break the long-term high.
*   Following the breakdown and consolidation, retail traders may see a bull flag pattern.
*   The speaker favors fading these patterns.
*   **Crucial Detail:** Every time price rebalances an imbalance (e.g., a candle's low to high range), the resulting swing high is immediately labeled an **Intermediate-Term High**. Conversely, if rebalancing on the downside occurs, the resulting swing low is classified as an **Intermediate-Term Low**.

## **Intermediate-Term Highs and Lows**

*   **Intermediate Term Lows:** Typically have a higher short-term low to the right and left.
*   Formed by rebalancing.
*   Have a higher short-term high before the creation of the Intermediate Term Low.
*   Failed rally indicates failure and is expected.

## **Avoiding Retail Traps (Pennants, Triangles)**

*   Retail traders may identify pennants or triangles.
*   **Common Question (from the speaker's past):** How do you know which side a pattern will break out on?
*   During the speaker's student days(1992-1993), every book on technical analysis was purchased, including "Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets" by John Murphy.
*   That book is an example of knowing what *not* to do because it represents the 90% mindset in retail analysis.
*   Uptrending trend lines (subjective: how to choose which swing lows to connect?) are unreliable.
*   A more scientific approach is required.
*   The speaker says, "We don't do technical analysis, we do technical science."
*   Relate to and measure factors in price action, without relying on hypothetical guesswork or harmonic patterns.
*   Focus on the relationship of price action and its behavior, discerning what it's indicating.
*   The market traded higher, then consolidated, failing to exceed the long-term high.
*   **Intermediate-Term High:** Short-term high to the left and short-term high to the right. Highest high between those two short term highs.
*   **Key Takeaway:** Whenever an imbalance is rebalanced, it becomes an Intermediate-Term Low (or High, depending on the direction).

## **Departing from Larry Williams' Market Structure**

*   The speaker now progresses to an important idea that departs from the teachings of Larry Williams (but Larry was influential in the speaker's early development).
*   **Source**: "Long-Term Secrets to Short-Term Trading" by Larry Williams.
*   The speaker has over 2,000 books, but only a handful are useful.


Here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, designed for clarity and ease of understanding, while preserving all original details, context, and nuances:

# **Advanced Market Structure: Expanding on Larry Williams' Concepts**

## **Influence of Larry Williams and Market Structure Basics**

*   Among the speaker's extensive book collection, only a few are truly useful.
*   Despite the nostalgia associated with them and the money spent, many trading books offer the same ineffective ideas.
*   The speaker credits **Larry Williams** for early insights on market structure.
*   Williams' teachings emphasized internalizing price structure, moving beyond simple "higher high, higher low" analysis.
*   Current generation pursues *simplicity for its own sake*, not necessarily for reaching the truth.
*   This pursuit contrasts with the speaker's approach, which can be a hurdle for those seeking instant gratification.
*   Mastering this takes time and effort, contrary to initial expectations.
*   The speaker’s initial understanding of price action stemmed from Williams' market structure ideas.
*   The speaker's paid group has *never seen* the specific content being presented.
*   Many traders define a trend change as a failed higher high followed by a break of the preceding swing low.
*   The speaker often views this as a buying opportunity, a retracement to a "deep discount."
*   Understanding the **higher timeframe** (red levels) is crucial.
*   Smaller timeframe price swings are subordinate to the order flow on higher timeframe charts.

## **Timeframe Considerations and Retail vs. Institutional Logic**

*   The **daily chart** carries the bulk of market volume.
*   A one-minute chart, *within proper context and market structure*, is valuable for navigation.
*   The speaker identifies as a retail trader but *rejects retail logic*.
*   He differentiates his approach from the collective that learns from books and conventional wisdom.
*   The speaker acknowledges pointing to a book (Larry Williams') but clarifies its limited usefulness.
*   The speaker respects Williams but finds his discussions on market structure the *only valuable* aspect of the book.
*   The speaker is *not* teaching Larry Williams' market structure directly.
*   The speaker's initial learning came from Williams' interpretation, but he expands on it.
*   The lecture will reveal ideas *not* taught by Williams, offering a deeper understanding.

## **Divergence from Larry Williams: Intermediate-Term Highs/Lows**

*   If an imbalance is rebalanced and an **Intermediate-Term High** is formed, *shouldn't* it have a lower short-term high to the right and left?
*   Larry Williams suggests so, but the speaker's research contradicts this.
*   The speaker independently "pioneered" the idea.
*   An intermediate-term high *doesn't necessarily need* to be higher than the short-term highs on either side.
*   If the intermediate term high is not higher than the highs on both sides, the market may be only rebalancing the imbalance.

## **Bearish Order Block Formation**

*   Considering pennant or triangle patterns, the speaker anticipates a failed price swing.
*   The speaker focuses on *two green, up-closed candles* right before the down move to form a bearish order block, NOT the last up-closed candle before the down move, which is what others are teaching.
*   The speaker emphasizes that he's watching these candles form with the *expectation* that they will lead to a breakdown.
*   From the beginning of that candle's low, the speaker is looking in time on the lower timeframes.
*   He anticipates the high won't be broken.

## **Timeframe Reduction and Targeting**

*   Having established the long-term high and long-term low on the hourly chart, the range is used for targeting purposes.
*   Speaker drops to a 15-minute timeframe (one timeframe below the 1-hour timeframe).
*   Inside the range of the hourly order block (defined by those two up-closed candles), the speaker hunts for fair value gaps.
*   He doesn't need price to trade below the last highest up-closed candle.
*   He is looking at the underpinnings of the marketplace, high to high and low to low, within the daily timeframe premise, where the market will go up to the upper level of the fair value gap, rebalance, and then eventually trade lower.
*   It’s going to make a short pattern to get short on, then work towards going down to the low.
*   He uses a fractal that repeats on a smaller or higher timeframe that's similar in its formation.
*   If price trades back to that candle high, that's an aggressive entry, but one the speaker is okay with.

## **Execution Timeframe and Market Structure Shift**

*   Once market structure is established on the hourly, there’s no need to mark out all swing highs and lows on lower timeframes.
*   The 15-minute timeframe is a "bellwether" for entries and exits.
*   Lower timeframes are used if the risk parameters on the 15-minute aren't suitable.
*   If price breaks a short-term low *and* an intermediate-term low (or just an intermediate-term low), the speaker reverts to the previous long-term high and long-term low.
*   The speaker frames logic around the fair value gap on the daily chart.
*   Institutions and banks operate off the daily chart, which determines bias and trend continuation.
*   Most study time should be spent determining the daily chart's direction over a 1-5 day horizon.

## **Significant Market Structure Breaks and Fibonacci Usage**

*   A break below both short and intermediate-term lows signifies a significant market structure break.
*   This allows for projecting targets downward using the range.
*   The Fibonacci tool can be used by anchoring it to the highest high down to the lowest low.
*   The Fibonacci is anchored to the intermediate-term high down to the long-term low for projections, because the retracement that fails, that starts the decline, begins there.
*   The projection is -1.5 standard deviations.
*   The speaker provides his Fibonacci settings, but does not toggle everything, because all the lines are not needed.
*   The Fibonacci measurements are used with logic, not randomly.

## **Advanced Market Structure: Algorithmic Perspective**

*   The speaker differentiates his method from what Mr. Williams teaches.
*   His approach is rooted in computer programming, computer science, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, driving him to understand the "why" behind market movements.
*   The speaker believes markets operate algorithmically, driven by AI, rather than simple buying/selling pressure.
*   Assuming an algorithm exists, it must follow some form of logic in determining price movements.
*   The algorithm doesn't see individual stops, but it *knows where stops are likely placed* based on concepts like short/intermediate/long-term highs and lows, and imbalances.
*   The speaker aims to create a language to visually represent and measure these algorithmic principles in charts.
*   The speaker is leaning on algorithmic principles in the marketplace.
*   This approach is close to what the algorithm is doing.

## **Zooming In: 15-Minute Timeframe Aggressive Entry**

*   Zooming in to the 15-minute timeframe reveals more candles within the hourly chart's range.
*   This timeframe allows for aggressive short entries.
*   Within the up-close candle series, a fair value gap formation with a breakdown is key.
*   A short-term low being broken in the model that he teaches.
*   Understanding market structure from a higher timeframe, anticipating a breakdown, and classifying imbalances/swing highs/lows is the core of the speaker's approach.


Here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, designed for clarity and ease of understanding, while preserving all original details, context, and nuances:

# **Advanced Market Structure: Further Elaboration on Key Concepts**

## **Rebalancing, Intermediate-Term Highs/Lows, and Smart Money**

*   Highs and lows form at the rebalancing of an imbalance.
*   The speaker reiterates concepts already discussed in the video.
*   If the **intermediate-term high** is *not* higher than two short-term highs, it indicates market weakness.
*   The algorithm reveals its intentions to "Smart Money" traders.
*   These traders *do not* use harmonic ideas, Elliot Wave, or traditional support and resistance.
*   **Bank traders** focus on:
    *   Imbalance
    *   Rebalance
    *   Liquidity
*   In Forex, this is framed within the context of interest rate differentials (to be discussed later).
*   These principles work in all markets, not just index futures.

## **Aggressive Entries and Advanced Order Block Interpretation**

*   An aggressive entry *doesn't require* a swing low to be broken.
*   This strategy relies on market structure suggesting extreme weakness.
*   The speaker studies *up-closed candles* in anticipation of a bearish order block formation.
*   The "classic" ICT bearish order block is identified *after* price moves below it and returns to test it.
*   The *advanced interpretation* of an order block uses unconventional market structure analysis.
*   This involves recognizing imbalances *inside* the order block while anticipating a sell-off.
*   The **intermediate-term high**, once identified through rebalancing, *should not* be violated.

## **Intermediate-Term High Definition and Trade Management**

*   An intermediate-term high has *two classifications*:
    1.  A short-term high with a lower short-term high to its left and right.
    2.  Price trades back up to rebalance an imbalance.
*   If bearish and an imbalance rebalances, the *next* short-term high *should* be lower than the intermediate-term high.
*   If price trades *higher* than that intermediate-term high, the trade idea is likely flawed.
*   *Avoid forcing the trade*. Wait for market structure to realign with a bearish expectation.
*   This approach prevents account blow-up and forcing trades.

## **Lower Timeframe Analysis and Order Block Refinement**

*   On a 15-minute timeframe, the speaker looks for lower timeframe triggers within the hourly order block.
*   The imbalance trades up into the order block, creating an aggressive sell opportunity.
*   The stop-loss can be placed right above that high.
*   A classic, low-risk, high-confirmation short entry involves a return to the order block after a trade down.

## **Perfect Delivery and Order Block Components**

*   Dropping to a 4-minute chart reveals that the low of the last two candles before the turn inside the order block aligns *perfectly* to the quarter point of that candle's high.
*   The order block isn't simply the last up-close candle before a down move.
*   It's a *consecutive series of up-closed candles* with an imbalance *inside* a larger order block, all within a bearish market structure.
*   The run-up will fail to go back above the intermediate-term high.

## **Bridging Algorithmic Pricing with Chart Language**

*   The speaker has developed a language within price charts that closely communicates what the algorithm is doing.
*   The *imbalance*, specifically within the hourly order block, is the target for limit orders.
*   The drawdown is limited to that candle's movement, while the stop-loss is placed above the order block.
*   The target is a large downside objective.

## **4-Minute Chart Refinement and Anticipating Imperfection**

*   The 4-minute chart shows the market trades up into the order block perfectly.
*   The market trades lower, then back up into the top end of the fair value gap.
*   Volatility means markets won't always deliver with perfect precision.
*   Experience allows anticipating a certain measure of imperfection.
*   A slight move above a level *doesn't necessarily invalidate* the setup and further upside movement is likely.

## **Advanced Market Structure and Institutional Order Flow: Key Principles**

*   When an imbalance is rebalanced, the resulting high *should not* be violated if bearish.
*   Blend this with institutional order flow: *up-closed candles should keep price from going higher*.

## **Bearish Order Block Example and Institutional Order Flow in Action**

*   On a 4-minute chart, the market trades back up into the 5-minute bearish order block.
*   Up-closed candles are present, but price *doesn't overtake* them.
*   It acts as resistance, demonstrating institutional order flow.
*   Up-closed candles *never get reached again* after the market breaks lower.

## **Synthesizing Market Structure and Order Flow: Key Takeaways**

*   **Market Structure:** Break down price swings and label them. An imbalance that's rebalanced creates an intermediate-term high or low that *should not* be violated.
*   **Institutional Order Flow:** If bearish, *up-closed candles should keep price below them*.
*   If an intermediate-term high or low is broken, the trade idea is wrong, and one should move to the sidelines.
*   **Bullish Markets**: Should see *down-closed candles* support price if it trades back down to them.

## **Defining Swing Highs/Lows: A Complex Perspective**

*   Determining which swing highs and lows to use is not a simple question.
*   It requires deeper thought, study, and supportive lessons.
*   The speaker doesn't expect the audience to immediately grasp these concepts.
*   He'll provide more examples to illustrate the logic.
*   **Action Item:** Go back to charts and classify instances where the market rebalances as intermediate-term highs or lows.
*   Frame the context around a price swing linked to a higher timeframe chart (e.g., the daily).
*   Higher timeframe order flow is *paramount* for a trade to work.

## **Trading with the Daily Chart and Avoiding Counter-Trend Trades**

*   If you are trading *against* the direction of the daily chart, you are setting yourself up for failure.
*   While it's possible to go long when the daily chart is trending lower, it's *not advisable*.
*   Work *with* the ebb and flow of the markets on a higher timeframe.
*   If you understand the daily chart, and the logic behind it, you are more likely to succeed.


Here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, designed for clarity and ease of understanding, while preserving all original details, context, and nuances:

# **Avoiding Common Trading Mistakes and Understanding Market Neutrality**

## **The Importance of Higher Timeframe Alignment**

*   By focusing on the daily timeframe, traders can avoid many losing trades.
*   Losing trades are inevitable, but aligning with the daily chart minimizes "silly mistakes" common among retail traders.
*   **Retail Traders** often get trapped by quick intraday pops that move counter to the daily trend.
*   These pops appear as potential reversals on 5-minute or 15-minute charts, but are often just traps.
*   When the daily chart indicates a continued downtrend, these pops create selling opportunities.
*   Traders must "submit" to the direction and objectives of the daily chart.
*   Once the daily target is reached, reassess the market and your bearings.

## **Rebalancing and Market Assessment**

*   The speaker refers to a previous analysis where a rebalancing was expected, leading to a run down.
*   Price has now moved back above the old low, requiring a reassessment.
*   Currently, the speaker is **neutral** on the market.

## **Understanding Neutrality**

*   Why be neutral?
    *   Being bearish is still possible.
    *   Being bullish against the daily trend carries a greater risk.
*   While historical examples can be found to justify counter-trend trades, the focus is on the "hard right edge" (the present).
*   The speaker emphasizes that his paid mentorship group is receiving the same real-time assessment.

## **Reasons for Neutrality: Global Uncertainty and Market Confusion**

*   There's significant global uncertainty.
*   "Money is running scared" in the market.
*   The speaker lacks a clear sense of the market's next direction.
*   He openly admits, "I don't know."
*   If the speaker can't classify the market based on his criteria, he remains neutral.
*   While a small upward move or reversal is possible, it's not certain.
*   Even positive global developments might occur, but aren't currently predictable.
*   The speaker emphasizes his inability to justify a one-sided (bullish or bearish) perspective.

## **High Probability Trading: Bullish vs. Bearish Scenarios**

*   The speaker explains his approach to his paid group:
    *   A **bullish** idea requires easy communication of upward potential and a difficult time framing a high-probability bearish scenario.
    *   Conversely, a **bearish** idea requires easy framing of downward potential and difficulty defining a high-probability bullish perspective.

## **The Pitfalls of Indecisive Trading**

*   The speaker critiques taking trades when the market could go either way.
*   Entering such trades often leads to regret and the thought, "I don't even know why I did that."
*   The speaker admits to blowing accounts in the 1990s due to reckless, illogical trading.
*   This experience taught him the importance of respecting risk.

## **Conclusion and Expectations**

*   The lesson concludes with the expectation that viewers will have questions, concerns, and confusions.
*   These will be addressed over time through continued learning and examples.
*   Complete understanding requires time and experience, not a single lesson.
*   The speaker dismisses those who claim instant mastery.
*   He only wants to highlight comments that are beneficial and appropriate for the community.

## **Addressing Community Questions**

*   The speaker assures viewers that their questions are considered and used to shape his teaching.
*   Many questions will be answered naturally as the lessons progress.
*   He anticipates questions and has answers ready, even to questions not yet formulated.
*   Viewers are encouraged to relax and progress through the material systematically.

## **The Technical Nature of Market Structure**

*   The speaker acknowledges the highly technical nature of the subject matter.
*   While such deep technicality isn't strictly necessary, it was requested.
*   He criticizes those on YouTube who superficially discuss market structure without true understanding.
*   He aims to provide a greater level of detail and insight.

## **Demonstrating Predictive Accuracy**

*   The speaker reminds the audience that he outlined a market move of 14,500 points, which then unfolded as predicted.
*   This real-world example reinforces the logic he's teaching.
*   The speaker emphasizes that his calls are not cherry-picked.
*   He presents teachings based on sound logic, rather than blind faith.
*   Viewers should believe what they see in the charts through backtesting and live observation, not simply because it's him (ICT) saying it.

## **Focus on Learning and Discernment**

*   Even with consistent accuracy, some will still doubt.
*   Those who are already convinced need no further assurance, only continued learning.
*   The speaker emphasizes his role as a teacher, explaining real-time market dynamics.
*   He is currently demonstrating a "greater lesson" of *when not to trade*.

## **Personal Stance: Staying Out of the Market**

*   Despite having the time, resources, and potential ideas, the speaker is personally avoiding the market.
*   He is not trading Forex, Futures, crypto (which he's never traded), stocks, or bonds.
*   He plans to abstain from trading for the remainder of February.

## **Recap and Introduction of New Concepts**

*   The market delivered precisely as outlined, providing a logical and precise price move.
*   The speaker has now revealed the "internals" behind that move in a structured and detailed way.
*   Even his paid mentorship group may struggle initially, as this is a new concept for them.
*   This is the first time he's unveiling his approach to analyzing market structure and framing trading ideas.

## **Top-Down Approach and Order Flow**

*   He employs a top-down approach, moving from the daily to lower timeframes.
*   The setup is framed on the hourly chart, using higher timeframe logic and order flow.
*   He was bearish because the daily chart suggested a move lower.

## **Explaining Market Dynamics: Fair Value Gaps and Imbalances**

*   The market dropped quickly, creating a fair value gap.
*   This one-sided move creates an expectation for price to return to that area.
*   The market revisits the area to offer buyers an opportunity, regardless of their accuracy.
*   The algorithm facilitates efficiency in price delivery.
*   In simpler terms, the market went down too quickly without allowing buyers sufficient opportunity.
*   After rebalancing, another displacement occurs, leading to the previously outlined target.

## **The Riddle of Market Discipline**

*   The speaker poses a crucial question:
    *   Why does the market respect the levels and logic he teaches, based on imbalance and liquidity?

*   He challenges the notion that the market follows trendlines, moving averages, harmonic patterns, Elliot Wave, or other conventional tools.
*   If those tools were truly influential, how would the market "choose" which discipline to follow on any given day?
    *   Harmonic patterns?
    *   Elliot Wave?
    *   Supply and demand?
    *   Volume profile?
    *   Wyckoff?
    *   Range bar patterns?
    *   Ichimoku?

*   These disciplines often contradict each other, giving conflicting signals.
*   Therefore, relying on them is akin to "being religious" – subscribing to a faith-based premise without solid grounding.

## **The Algorithm's True Drivers: Liquidity and Rebalancing**

*   The market prints candles based on only two principles:
    1.  Liquidity: Running above old highs for buy stops and below old lows for sell stops.
    2.  Rebalancing or creating imbalance.

*   The algorithm *only* focuses on imbalance, rebalance, and liquidity runs.
*   It *doesn't* consider harmonic patterns or other subjective indicators.
*   The speaker emphasizes the silliness of attributing human-like thought processes to the algorithm.

## **Challenging Perceptions and Advocating for Critical Thinking**

*   The speaker encourages viewers to critically examine their perceptions of trading.
*   He acknowledges that his perspective might seem biased due to his teachings.
*   However, he highlights his decision to give up a lucrative career to teach for free.
*   He emphasizes that he doesn't need the money or recognition.
*   He urges the audience to consider why the market behaves so precisely and consistently according to his teachings.
*   He suggests that this may be because his understanding reflects the true workings of the market and the algorithm.

## **Closing Remarks**

*   The speaker leaves the audience to ponder these questions.
*   He wishes them a safe weekend and promises to return on Tuesday.

## Market Structure and Advanced Price Action: Episode 13

**Video URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpPtItWqmlg

### Introduction

Alright folks, welcome back! This is an extra lesson, but we'll still call it **Episode 13**. Last night, I gave a lesson on **market structure** for precision technicians, and this lesson will focus on **advanced price action theory in action**.

### Demo Account Execution & Mindset

It's one thing to talk about market structure, but this lesson will provide the basis for my executions. I'm often asked, "How am I running these demo accounts up so quickly?" For example, many people asked about running the $10,000 account up to $256,000 this morning. However, the growth became so rapid that it became difficult for students to relate to. The acceleration was too fast.

**Key Principles:**

*   Even though it's a demo account, the **same principles apply** as when trading with a live account.
*   My goal is to demonstrate **how I run the equity up quickly** and the **mindset** behind it.

### Market Conditions & Risk Management

Before I get into the specifics, let's recap what I stated last night: Due to heightened volatility, uncertainty, and the potential for unexpected price action moves, I'm hesitant to risk my live account. I'm technically bearish on equities, but I don't feel confident risking my February gains by going short after the market has already delivered what I expected.

**Objectives:**

*   I have a specific **objective for the week**.
*   I have a specific **objective for the day**.
*   I have a specific **goal for the month**.

### Aiming for 20% Monthly Returns: A Realistic Goal?

The account I'm showing on **TD Ameritrade** is intended to illustrate how a new student might perform with live trading using my model, aiming for **20% per month**. Some may think 20% isn't a lot, but it's a percentage, not a fixed amount.

**Compounding Effects:**

*   If you consistently make 20%, the **compounding effects are astonishing**, even if you start with just $1.

**Realistic Expectations:**

*   I would never guarantee that students can consistently hit 20% every month.
*   I might not even hit 20% every month, but it's a **goal I'm aiming for**.

### The Path to Live Trading

If you're a new, developing student who has worked hard to refine your model using my teachings, and you have a well-documented trading plan that covers what you're doing, what you're not doing, and a complete understanding of when to engage (or not engage) in price, *and* you know how to manage risk, *and* you've been consistent with a demo account for six months, *then*, and only then, would I *consider* (not necessarily recommend) going into live trading.

**Important Disclaimer:**

*   I never tell my students whether I think they're ready for live trading.
*   I generally ignore those emails, because I **never want to be on record** saying someone is ready for live trading, and then they blow their account and blame me.
*   No mentor or educator worth their salt would tell you to risk live money.

### Lessons from the Past: Avoiding Premature Live Trading

Experience has taught me that I got into live trading **way too fast in 1992**. It was the worst thing I could have done for my development. I rushed into real money trading with no idea what I was doing, tricked myself into believing it was easy after reading one book, and did no real backtesting.

**1992 Trading Experience:**

*   Thought I saw a "one-two-three top" and "one-two-three bottom" pattern.
*   Lost 50% of my history on my first trade.
*   Closed the account out of fear.

### The Importance of Backtesting and Demo Trading

When we understand what we're trying to do, it comes with nervousness and anxiety because you haven't put in the time for backtesting and demo account forward testing.

**Indicators of Being Unprepared:**

*   If you feel a "tug of war" or "butterfly feeling" in your stomach when engaging in the marketplace, **you're not ready**.
*   You need to desensitize yourself to the results. Losing shouldn't matter to you. You must be indifferent to it.

**Characteristics of a Prepared Trader:**

*   A student with a solid price action model and a well-documented trade plan knows:
    *   What they're going to do.
    *   Why they're doing it.
    *   What they're waiting for.
    *   What will cause them to push the button to get in.
    *   Where their stop loss will be.
    *   How much they're going to risk.
    *   What they're going to aim for.
    *   Where their partials will be (if any).

**Crucial Point:** You have to know these things in advance, not after entering the marketplace. Retail traders, and I did the same in 1992, get into a trade and then try to figure out what they're supposed to do.

### Trading in Demo Account During Uncertain Times

I want you to see what I was showing last night. Even though I'm not personally willing to risk my live account right now due to current conditions (Ukraine, etc.) and the potential for a black swan event, I go right to a demo account. The market has delivered what I expected in my analysis, so I'm not trying to get in and do anything else.

**Benefits of Demo Trading in Volatile Markets:**

*   It provides me with context.
*   It keeps me glued to what the market is doing, allowing me to read the tape.
*   It enables me to answer student questions and continue teaching effectively.
*   Most importantly: I'm not taking on monetary risk when I don't believe it's wise.

**Why Risk Aversion is Important:**

*   If I were wrong and lost what I gained in February, it would eat at me all through March. It's toxic thinking, which I learned the hard way.

### Understanding the Demo Account's Purpose

I'm going to show you executions in the TradingView paper trading account. It's important to understand that:

*   Using a demo account protects me and you, because I'm not licensed to give you trade advice.
*   You can't make money following me in a trade, so if I'm wrong, you don't take a financial loss.
*   If I'm right, you can't make money and get tricked into thinking that the only way you're going to make money is to follow me.
*   If I don't know what I'm doing, things will fail on the demo account just as easily as they would in a live account.

### Trading Analysis Example

With that foundation laid, let's go into the discussion.

**The Setup:**

*   We went below this low.
*   I don't want to sell it short even though I'm bearish.
*   What's it likely to reach up into?

**Potential Targets:**

*   I'm thinking it could potentially trade up into the up-closed candle.
*   Specifically, the low or the open of that candle.
*   That's the magnet or the draw on liquidity.
*   It could also reach up into this little area with the fair value gap.
*   It can go right up there and then still resume going lower. It might need to go up into that.

**Market Context:**

*   This morning, I was watching the Nasdaq and the E-mini S&P (ES).
*   ES had a lot of energy to the upside.
*   Usually, these markets move in tandem.
*   Even though the Nasdaq was lethargic, the tendency is that it will be drawn to the same degree as ES.
*   "All boats rise in high tide," basically.

**Hourly Chart Analysis:**

*   I was trading all of this in a demo account and it ran up into absurd levels.
*   I satisfy my itch with the demo account when I'm not trading with the live account.
*   There is no fraud required to make these things compound and blow up quickly in terms of equity increases.
*   I'm going to show you how, even with a micro account.

**Micro E-Mini Nasdaq:**

*   This is the micro E-mini Nasdaq.
*   Every one point (four ticks) is equivalent to two dollars.
*   I'm using a micro account with a discount broker.
*   The discount broker I'm hypothetically using is **AMP Futures**.

**Trading Scenario:**

*   Down closed candle after a run-up.
*   We retraced and went down inside this gap.
*   This area is the draw on liquidity.
*   Above these relative equal highs, we have buy-side liquidity.
*   I'm thinking that the algorithm isn't letting price go lower.
*   It's going after everyone that's been profitable going short.
*   Where are their stops? Right here.
*   We're going to call it 14,110.
*   The market starts to rally and leaves this down closed candle.
*   I'm going to watch to see if it can trade back down into that.
*   If it does, I'm going to treat that as a **bullish order block**.

**Bullish vs Bearish Order Blocks**

*   Remember, in a bullish move, down closed candles should not be violated; they will act as support.
*   In a bearish move, up closed candles should not be breached or broken through.

**Understanding Market Psychology:**

*   When you're bearish and the market is going down and you see candles starting to form a potential up-closed candle, you get scared.
*   You snap yourself out of the desire to hold the trade and collapse it because you can't handle the uncertainty.
*   It's like "mental cancer" that makes you want to get out of the trade, even when you're in profit.

**Profitability and Anxiety:**

*   The trade is profitable, but you can't stand it anymore.
*   It's worse when you have live account funds and a profit.
*   If you don't have the experience to submit to these ideas and watch them come to fruition over and over again, you'll want to collapse the trade.

**Long-Term Price Swings:**

*   When looking for a price move that's a long-term swing, it's not about time, but this time frame is a nice decline.

**Identifying Accumulation Zones:**

*   All the down closed candles, does it go below this down closed candle when it starts to retrace?
*   No, we expect these to be areas where they're going to accumulate more long positions.
*   We retrace, go down into an imbalance, and the market rallies.
*   Does it support price? Yes.

**Time of Day Considerations:**

*   Time of day is important.
*   I'm watching when price comes back down into it.
*   I'm taking the opening price and extending it out in time.
*   When that occurs, I know I have a setup where I can go long.
*   I want to go into the time frames a little lower than the hourly chart to give me a bit more context.

**Market Structure & Liquidity**

*   We have a low that has a higher low to the left and a higher low to the right.
*   That makes this what? An intermediate term low.
*   This retracement might be trading into an imbalance.
*   The overall market structure is likely to go higher and aim for a run above these highs (buy-side liquidity resting there).

**Analyzing the Chart:**

*   We're going to take these levels.
*   This red level is anchored to this here (relative equal highs).
*   Stops are above that.
*   Rallies come back down in.
*   We're looking to see if it wants to run through that.
*   Notice this high and this high.
*   It creates what? Relative equal highs.
*   Retail-minded traders will see that and say, "Oh, this is exactly what the textbooks say about resistance."
*   It's acting as a ceiling.
*   What should they expect to see price do? Go over it.

**Hourly Down Closed Candle:**

*   Here's that level where the buy stops are.
*   We're above it, rather.
*   Here's that hourly down closed candle, which is a bullish order block.
*   Notice the down closed candle is made up of two candles on the five-minute time frame.
*   Price moves away from it, goes above it right here.
*   Does it create an imbalance here? Yes.

**High Probability Bullish Order Block:**

*   That is how you determine your high probability bullish order block: It must have the imbalance coupled with the down closed candle and the underlying narrative that it's likely to go higher to reach for buy-side liquidity.

**Indicator Scams:**

*   I just noticed, by the way, there's a guy out there trying to hawk a seven-dollar indicator and he says he's the real deal and it's all about order blocks.
*   I'm not going to change the name on that, just let you know.

**Time of Day & Judas Swing**

*   We're trading down into this imbalance here, but we're doing it at the time of day after the equity is open at 9:30 in the morning New York time.
*   Volatility is the initial move, technically the incorrect move going into the opening at 9:30.
*   This is like a "Judas Swing."

**Final Note:**

*   Think about what we're seeing here now. The market's likely to go up above this level here to take the buy-side because the market's unwilling to go lower. The algorithm keeps pressing higher and higher. It retraces down into the 9:30 opening. This is that fake move. Don't chase this.


Here's a restructured version of the provided text, optimized for readability and clarity, while preserving every detail of the original content:

## Advanced Price Action Analysis and Demo Account Execution

### Avoiding Chasing Price

*   **Don't chase** price movements going higher right before the equity opening at 9:30 AM.

### Identifying Trading Opportunities: A Step-by-Step Approach

*   **Step Back & Analyze**: Determine what you are looking for in the market.
    *   **Discount Market**: A move from low to high.
    *   **Below 50%**: Price is below the 50% level.
    *   **Inside the Order Block**: Price is within the order block.
    *   **Equity Opening**: The equity market has opened.
    *   **Bullish Sentiment**: You have a bullish outlook.
    *   **Price Traded Lower**: The price has traded lower.
*   **Anticipate Public Perception**:
    *   The public will perceive the level as **resistance** and expect it to continue downwards.
    *   They will look for the previous **support level** as a potential bounce point.
*   **Five-Minute Chart Confirmation**:
    *   The market hits the **order block** and rallies.
*   **Understanding Order Block Formation & Fair Value Gaps**:
    *   Price trades back down, overlapping a gap between a candle's high and another candle's low.
    *   This creates:
        *   One order block.
        *   A lower timeframe order block.
        *   A fair value gap.

### Executing the Trade

*   **Entry Conditions**:
    *   You can take the trade IF you know what you're looking for.
    *   AND you understand bias, narrative, and where the liquidity matrix is likely to lead.
*   **Target**: Aiming for liquidity above a specific red level.
*   **Stop Loss**: Place stops above a defined point.
*   **Profit Taking Strategy**:
    *   If the price rallies from the entry point, consider where those who went long would ideally exit.
    *   It's unlikely they'd aim for just 6-10 points higher.
    *   Instead, target areas where there are willing buyers with buy stops to protect their short positions.
    *   When the market trades above that level, the buy stops trigger market orders, creating liquidity.
    *   This allows those who bought lower to sell at a higher price to these willing buyers.

### The Trading Idea

*   **Entry**: Go long, overlapping and filling the gap, leveraging the order block (higher timeframe to lower timeframe).
*   **Rationale**: The overall market structure indicates a move higher for buy-side liquidity.
*   **Intermediate Term Low**:
    *   An intermediate-term low is forming.
    *   Once the gap fills, this low should not be taken out if the rally continues.
*   **Price Action Confirmation**: If price is going higher, down-closed candles should act as support.
    *   Price trades above the high of the down-closed candle and starts to rise.

### Managing Potential Drawdown

*   **Re-evaluation**:
    *   If price starts to move back down, it might trigger concerns.
    *   However, consider that it could be a move back into the down-closed candle to accumulate more long positions.
*   **Smart Money Accumulation**: Expect smart money traders to buy more at this point.
*   **Rally and Support**: The market rallies, and down-closed candles should continue to support price.

### Example Scenario

*   Retracement into Imbalance: The market retraces down into an imbalance, allowing smart money to buy again.
*   Order Block Dynamics:
    *   Trades through equity order block.
    *   Get long on fair value gap order block retracement.
    *   Get long on order block imbalance with the fair value gap.
*   **Limited Retracement**: The market generally does not fully rebalance when close to the profit objective.
*   **Algorithm Behavior**: The algorithm makes a small retracement inside the fair value gap, making it a buying opportunity just above that candle's low.
*   **Target Hit**: The market runs directly to the target.

### TradingView Confirmation

*   To address skepticism, a demonstration within TradingView will be shown to confirm entries with actual execution errors.
*   Chart timeframe will be decreased down to 30 seconds to reveal grouping of precise entry points based on logic.

### Maintaining Perspective and Trailing Stops

*   **Trust in the Structure**: The intermediate-term low should not be overtaken until the objective is reached.
*   **Confidence in Higher Movement**: Trust that price action will continue to move higher, as long as down-closed candles support each leg higher.
*   **Trailing Stop Logic**:
    *   Do not place stop losses too tightly.
    *   If a stop was positioned below the midpoint of the bullish order block, it is unlikely price will go below that point once entering.
    *   Once price rises above the candle's high, the stop loss must remain below the candle's low.
    *   The market can "dig" into that candle because it acts as an order block.

### Handling Premature Stop-Outs

*   **Potential for Re-Entry**: If stopped out prematurely, avoid fear of re-entering.
*   **Infancy**: Premature stop-outs are common when beginning and understanding of price delivery is not complete.
*   **Progression**: Consistency leads to ingrained understanding of price delivery.

### Stop Loss Adjustment

*   **Down-Closed Candle Significance**:
    *   Once the market takes out two down-closed candles, adjust the stop.
    *   The stop can now be raised below the subsequent down-closed candle.
    *   The down-closed candles should form one order block that shouldn't be violated if bullish.
*   **Failure Indication**: If the market breaks the low of these down-closed candles, being stopped out was likely the correct decision.

### Realism & Transparency

*   **Imperfection Acknowledged**: Perfection is not attainable, even with experience.
*   **TradingView Demonstration**: Actual trades demonstrate entry near the low and exit near the high.
*   **No Manipulation**: Screenshots or images are not manipulated in any way.
*   **Application of Theory**: The logic being taught is directly applied from the previous night's lesson.
*   **Demo Account Reality**: Demonstrations are done within a demo account, though the live data in the demo account mirrors what is shown on live accounts.

### TradingView Demonstration (Live)

*   **Live Market View**: Live market data is presented in TradingView.
*   **Current Market Observation**: The market is currently hovering around a previous high.
*   **Missing Moves is Okay**: Missing a particular move is not a cause for concern.
*   **Focus on Logic**: Emphasis on entering in logical places, where it is reasonable to anticipate price to advance higher from the entry point.

### Simplifying Complex Concepts

*   **Clarity over Complexity**: Complex topics are simplified to facilitate easier understanding.
*   **Bridging the Gap**: The goal is to create a language that bridges complex topics into a more digestible method.
*   **Repeatable Setups**: Focus on elements that form simple, logical setups that repeat frequently.
*    **Managing Expectations**: The demo account may show high results, which can cause the feeling of "absurdity." This is only for demonstration and should not encourage others to try and mirror this using live accounts.

### Demo Account Trading as a Puzzle

*   **Treating Trading as a Game**: He treats demo account trading as a puzzle, looking for the outcome of a specific trading session.
*   **Analyzing Candlestick Patterns**: He navigates those candlesticks and patterns.
*   **Trade Execution Visuals**: He hovers the cursor over trade executions to visually display that the entries were not photoshopped.

### Proof of Concepts

*   **Precision**: Demonstration proves precision in application.
*   **Theory in Action**: Proves the viability of theory in action.
*   **Flawless Logic**: Proves the concept is not flawed.
*   **Rejection of Retail Trading Strategies**: Confirms that this methodology is not based on traditional retail trading.
*   **Uniqueness**: Method is not Elliott Wave, Harmonic patterns, Supply & Demand, or Chris Lori's material.

### Micro Account Trading Illustration

*   **Addressing Concerns**: Illustrates for the viewers that you can grow an account using micro accounts, addressing concerns that viewers have brought up.
*   **Stop The Thinking**: Stop thinking that you need a lot to make a lot.
*   **Compounding**: You need to be able to compound the things that are demonstrated.
*   **Pyramiding**: The process of pyramiding up accounts quickly.
*   **Buying Strategy**:
    *   When a buy signal is seen, buy more, as long as the target objective is not met.
    *   Don't buy more than three at a time.
    *   Pyramid your way up, building with a smaller position than prior to the initial.
    *   Largest base at the bottom (three), then smaller (two), then smaller (one).
    *   Allows ability to weather any retracements.
    *   If the pyramid is upside down, (one, then two, then three) it is not stable.

### Demo Account Results

*   **Hypothetical Starting Point**: Starting with a hypothetical $10,000 account on a demo account.
*   **$2,111 Profit with 3 Scalings**: Over $2,111 one trade with three scalings.
*   **Trade Classification**: One trade scaled in, not three separate trades.
*   **Scaling Sequence**: Largest, middle, last position runs to the objective.
*   **Final Result**: Account history starts at $10,000 and ends with $12,111.00 demo money.
*   **Transparency**: Time, everything toggled, nothing is hidden.

### Micro Account Perspective

*   **Who Cares?**: The question to the audience is who cares about trading micro accounts.
*   **Capital Required**: Six micro contracts requires $1,200.
*   **Leverage**: $10,000 with this position size and gearing is optimal.
*   **Above Average**: $2,111 is well above average.
*   **Weekly Trade**: What happens if you do this once a week and stop?
*   **Trade Less**: You can have leaps and bounds with equity and peace of mind.
*   **Goal**: This is what I am trying to cultivate in the community.
*   **Not a Daily Routine**: The goal is to not become a monster and trade every day.
*   **Likely to Form**: The concepts are likely to form every day, but definitely form every week.
*   **No Invitation**: This is not an invitation to trade every day.
*   **Don't Take One Comment Out Of Context**: Have to have a balanced act when listening.
*   **Avoid Premature Application**: Don't apply until well-versed.

### Responsibility & Goal Setting

*   **Avoid Blame**: When accounts are blown, it is the trader's fault, not the broker's.
*   **Goal Orientation**: Think about these examples as the goal.
*   **It Takes Time**: It takes time to grow to that understanding.
*   **Have a Goal**: It takes a measure of goal setting that you have to have.
*   **No Target**: Without aiming for a target, you will hit nothing.
*   **Easy Objectives**: Set very low hanging objectives.
*   **Proven Success**: Many of the 2016 and 2017 students have success with these trades.


## Mastering Price Action: A Journey of Practice and Consistency

### The Path to Proficiency: Six Months of Dedicated Practice

*   I believe that with **six months of dedicated practice** and focused observation of **price action**, you can achieve consistent profitability in trading.
*   **Consistency defined**: Not necessarily trading every day, but rather finding setups like the ones discussed, even if it's only **once a week**, and working that position accordingly.

### Availability and Deeper Insights

*   I'm making myself available on **my YouTube channel twice a week**.
*   Today’s video is an extra one, prompted by the more complex nature of last night's content.
*   While studying market structure involves deep and intricate analysis, I aim to present the core concepts in a simplified, accessible language.
*   Be assured that you don't need an advanced academic understanding to apply these principles effectively.
*   The teaching methods employed here achieve the same results as those complex methods, but without the added difficulty.

### Simplifying Complexities: Addressing Trader Concerns

*   I anticipate questions like: "How do I classify swing highs – short-term, medium-term, or long-term? How does he know?"
*   That level of intricate detail can be overwhelming.
*   Therefore, I've developed a **simplified language** to make these concepts accessible.
*   My lessons demonstrate how I've streamlined complex approaches for public consumption.

### Retail vs. Institutional Logic: Unveiling the Truth

*   I can illustrate the vast complexities that underpin market dynamics.
*   You need to understand certain **repeating patterns** that are generic in price.
*   These patterns are not linked or built upon the foundation of any retail trading logic.
*   Reject support and resistance or any of those other disciplines that people use and build businesses around selling books and courses.

### A Unique Advantage: Integrating with Existing Strategies

*   If you're currently using strategies like **Elliott Wave** or **Harmonic Patterns**, incorporating my teachings will enhance your winning trades.
*   You'll find my principles underpinning your successful trades.
*   Conversely, the absence of these principles will often correlate with your losing trades.

### The Ultimate Trading Approach: A Humble Submission

*   The question that plagues all speculators is: "Which trading approach will consistently generate profits and minimize losses from flawed strategies?"
*   I humbly suggest that you've found it.
*   This method is available to you **free of charge**.
*   It will require **work, time, and effort**.
*   You might feel frustrated and struggle to grasp the concepts initially.
*   But that's normal; everyone experiences that.
*   Eventually, you'll understand it.
*   Some individuals grasp it quickly, while others take longer.
*   It’s like riding a bike: once you learn, you never forget.
*   This proficiency provides comfort and confidence.

### Outpacing Inflation: The Power of Consistent Profitability

*   With consistent profitability, economic factors like inflation become less concerning.
*   Your goal should always be to **outpace inflation**.
*   Wealth is possible, but not guaranteed.
*   Losses are inevitable in trading, regardless of your system, discipline, or educator.
*   Even seasoned traders experience drawdowns, but they can recover quickly with experience.

### Navigating the Learning Curve: Trusting the Process

*   You will encounter challenges at unpredictable times.
*   Suspend the need to have all the answers right now.
*   Diligent chart analysis and backtesting of my teachings are crucial.
*   This hands-on experience is more valuable than books, courses, or paid mentorships.
*   I'm teaching you to learn directly from price action.
*   Price will teach you by revealing repeating patterns.
*   Constant observation trains your eye to recognize these patterns.

### Beyond the Textbook: Recognizing Patterns in Real-Time

*   Traditional trading books offer limited examples, often showcasing ideal scenarios.
*   Remember your initial excitement about bullish and bearish divergences using the Stochastic indicator?
*   You might have found it easy to identify in textbook examples.
*   However, applying it to live charts often resulted in failed trades, as the price continued to decline despite the apparent divergence.
*   Textbooks showcase examples that support their theories, not necessarily the complexities of real-world trading.
*   I'm teaching you to identify repeating patterns within price action itself.
*   This isn't based on a few curated examples, but on patterns that occur daily and weekly.

### Weekend Greetings

*   Enjoy your weekend.
*   I will be back with you on Tuesday, Lord willing.
*   Until then, be safe.

# Trading Execution Breakdown: Micro NASDAQ Futures Contract

This document breaks down a trading execution for a Micro NASDAQ Futures Contract (MNQ), as described in the provided video.

**Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdu1n-ML98](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdu1n-ML98)

## Initial Setup and Rationale

*   The trader was requested to show how they use their trading model.
*   **Market Structure:** A market structure shift to the upside was observed.
*   **Objective:** The trader was looking for a gap fill from Friday's close.
*   **Position:** Going long.
*   **Contract Details:** 12 micros of the Micro NASDAQ Futures Contract (MNQ).
*   **Target:** Price to drop into the fair value gap and run above **14,160**.
*   **Initial Interest:** **14,180**, with a potential target of **14,220** for the day.

## Trade Execution

*   **Entry:** A limit entry order was placed, and the trader monitors price action near the closure of the fair value gap.
*   **Fair Value Gap Closure Observation:** The trader monitors price action near the closure of the fair value gap, watching for upward expansion.
    *   Focus is on candle movements, not the profit number.
    *   Looking for the price to move through the fair value gap around **14,122 - 14,138**.

## Anticipated Price Action

*   Expectation of consolidation in the **14,120 - 14,140** area.
*   Potential reaccumulation for new longs, forming a bull flag pattern.
*   Expansion on the upside looks favorable.
*   Considering moving the limit order up to **14,220**.

## Monitoring Key Levels

*   Watching how price trades above the short-term high made before 10:00 AM.
*   **Buy-side Interest:** Located around the **14,160** level (in the crosshairs).

## Potential Retail Trader Misconceptions

*   Retail traders might perceive **14,160** as resistance and initiate short positions based on past price action from that level.
*   The trader anticipates a breakout ("swat bust through the door") and a run-up to **14,180**.

## Profit Taking Strategy

*   Best-case scenario: Take six contracts off above the anticipated breakout level.
    *   Use the profits to fund the position.
    *   Roll stops to even.
    *   Aim for the limit order at **14,220**.

## Confirmation and Adjustment

*   Observing smaller consolidation around the fair value gap level.
*   Reaching into an order block.
*   Checking the e-mini S&P micro futures to gauge broader market sentiment.
    *   Looks like it also wants to run higher, increasing confidence in the trade.
*   **Decision:** Take six contracts off due to proximity to gap closure.
    *   **Revised Target:** The trader believes **14,220** is still achievable, but adjusts the strategy.

## Exit and Review

*   **Limit Order Filled:** The business limit order is filled.
*   **Entry Point:** Hovering over the entry to display the exact location.
*   **Low Candle Entry:** Highlights the low candle entry point.
*   **Exit Point:** Showing the limit order exit location.
*   Hopes the viewer found the execution insightful.

Okay, here's a detailed, structured, and readable version of the provided text, retaining all original information, tone, and nuance:

# YouTube Channel Update: Trading Live Equity Account on Vacation

**Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGxuitjtO88](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGxuitjtO88)

## Addressing Concerns & Setting the Stage

Alright, so this is going to be an update to the YouTube channel.  A lot of people are freaking out thinking I'm missing or gone.  I'm on vacation, folks! But I took the opportunity this morning to sit down with you and try to hopefully make a mile marker on the equity on this **Live account**.

**Goal:** I'm going to try to hit $50,000.

## Trade Analysis & Market Structure

I'm watching this potentially make a **fair value gap**.  I want to see that **swing high** broken.  Let's see if we get that here.

*   This account is really meant to show averaging like **20% a month**.
*   I get questions all the time like: "What do I think a student that has gone through all the teachings and worked out a model, you know, what could they reasonably expect to see, and what could be done without really pushing the envelope?"

This is kind of like my answer to that.  Also, to kind of remind everybody I'm not just finding cherry-picked trades in a demo account; I can trade with live funds too.

### Bullish Market Structure

Alright, so we're about to break that swing high. If it does, that'll be **bullish market structure**.  I'm thinking we can trade back to on the daily chart back to like 14,000, but that's a little bit of a stretch so far intraday.

Okay, we have the market structure bullish now.  So there's a fair value gap.

*   I'll highlight that.
*   I'll go into the chart here.

I'm watching this candle see how it closes because that will complete our imbalance. You can see that right there.

Okay, give me another right there. That's the low end of the fair value gap. This thing's always tricky.

### Fair Value Gap Analysis

All right, so now we have the close of that candle, so now I can... I'm a little off on that because I'm clumsy with Thinker Swim. I'll change the color here so you can see a little bit better.

Now it's technically the open so it's a little bit of volatility that comes in here. It can overshoot that low. I don't care if it does. If it goes back up into the fair value gap, I will buy it.

## Entry Strategy & Risk Management

Now when you're entering on like the opening, like 9:30 equities opening, uh, you could take a long entry here, but you don't know how far it's going to whip below that low, and you could be wrong and painfully wrong.

So what I'm watching is does it want to go below that short-term low that's already created moments ago, which would be outside and below the fair value gap, and it does not negate the fair value gap because I'm using narrative.

**Narrative:** I expect people to look at that and say okay, it's going to go up, and they're already trying to buy right now. But their stop loss is going to be below that swing low.

### Stop Loss Levels

Sell stops are resting at 13,612. They just took those now. Now this is a high-risk entry long there, but I'm watching price now entering that same fair value gap.

So one more time to see if it wants to poke a little bit lower. And I'm, again, my daily bias is bullish, so I'm looking for higher prices. So I'm going to go and aim for the 80 level. That'll give me a nice figure to run to 50,000 on equity. I do believe it's going to go higher, but I'm on vacation, so I want to kind of... let me take this long entry, and there you go.

### Monitoring Price Action

All right, so now I'm watching price, and I want to see it expand up now because it's the opening, and I don't know where if we whip below that low, I'll give it a chance to go below it just by a little bit, and I'll close it at market. Generally, I like to trade with a stop loss, but if I'm trading the open like this, stops can be taken really, really easily and then reverse and then never give you a chance to be in it.

So I'm allowing myself a little bit of flexibility. I'm not trying to encourage you to trade without a stop loss. Believe me, I'm right here ready to click and close it if it trades below it, and I want to see to expand up now. I want to see an energetic run above the swing high that was formed just to the left of where we are right now.

## Targets & Expectations

There is a small little fair value gap at the 680 level, and it's above equilibrium, so it would be a premium market. So that's why I'm going to be targeting the 80 level plus it's around 50 handle, so that gives me about $1,000 or more.

All right, so now, right now, at this moment, I want to see it expand aggressively, not you dilly dally around. I want to see it really try to spread its wings and take off and start moving.

### Fair Value Gap Considerations

There's a small little fair value gap in the last three candles up. I don't think it needs to fill that in or even revisit it, but if it were to, I would expect price to be, you know, supported by that. So other words, not going below the 630 level.

Okay, now at this moment, I could put the stop loss on at my entry, and if it takes me out, then I'm would basically move to the sidelines and wouldn't take any more trades today because it's FOMC.

## Economic Calendar Awareness & Limit Order Placement

See, and FOMC, you can trade in the morning, but you got to be done early. If you're trading equities, it's important to be aware of the **economic calendar** because we're probably going to have a lot of volatility later on today. I still think they'll push it higher with that.

So here's my limit order. I'm going to place it there, and we'll see if we can get this puppy to reach up there and grab it. I mean, I feel confident it's going to go way beyond that, but short little scout out, very little draw down about three handles of draw down if that from the entry or the candle I entered. I want to say it that way. The low from my entry was only like three handles below.

### Drawdown Analysis

I have to have to go watch the video and see what the actual draw down was from the point of entry. I'm not sure if I had any. If I did, then that's what it was limited to $60 or so, not bad if you're trying to make $1,000 had a small little scout early in the morning.

## Execution & Reflection

All right, and now this is where neight traders or newbies, they get nervous. Hit the wrong thing here. I always think I'm on the other platforms I use. I use Trade Station, and I use TradingView, and it's different settings and different things you can look for.

All right, so there's my fill on the limit order rounding out the day and the month of March. I will not be taking any more trades this month. So $1,255 on two trades about $15 or so in commissions, so take that off of there that will be the net for the day.

## Profit and Loss Overview

I'll take you over to the monitor tab here after I scrunch this up and show you the the run on the price. Now I think it's going to go higher, but here's the monitor tab showing the actual trades today, and you can see the profit and loss since I started this account and the commissions which are high because I did a lot of latency tests, and I've done a lot of things that would kind of like mimic what a new Trader would do once they get into live fund trading.

## Analyzing Multiple Setups Within Trading Sessions

**Video URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpGQnhjXBq8

This lesson focuses on identifying multiple trading setups within the morning and afternoon (PM) sessions, specifically when trading New York Index Futures. The core concept revolves around understanding the "split day" and incorporating the Power 3 (Accumulation, Manipulation, Distribution) with premium/discount market analysis.

### 1. Defining the Trading Sessions

*   **Morning Session:** 8:30 AM to Noon (New York Local Time)
*   **New York Lunch Hour:** Noon to 1:00 PM (New York Local Time)
*   **PM Session:** 1:00 PM onwards

It's important to recognize that multiple setups can occur within each of these sessions.

### 2. Example: S&P Futures Mini Contract (June 2022)

The example used is the S&P Futures Mini Contract for June 2022. The analysis highlights the importance of:

*   **Relative Equal Highs:** Buy stops and buy-side liquidity resting above these highs.
*   **Swing Highs:** A swing high is defined as a high followed by a lower high on the next candle, *distinct* from fractal patterns used on platforms like MT4.
*   **Anticipating Open, Rally, and Power 3:** The market is expected to open, rally (manipulation), and then follow the Power 3 concept (accumulation, manipulation, distribution).
*   **Premium/Discount Market Analysis:** Determining whether the market is in a premium (above old highs) or discount (below old lows) environment.
*   **Bullish Order Block:** A down-closed candle *after* the market trades above relative equal highs. Trading back into this down-closed candle can present a favorable setup.

**Disclaimer:** The speaker acknowledges the benefit of hindsight but emphasizes that consistent study will reveal these patterns repeating.

### 3. Hourly Chart Analysis & Power 3

The hourly chart is used to further illustrate the Power 3 concept. Key elements to consider:

*   **Daily Bullish Order Block Level:** Specific level mentioned is 4504.
*   **Relative Equal Lows:** Two lows that are relatively equal, indicating potential liquidity resting below.
*   **Discount Array (Bullish Order Block):** The combination of relative equal lows *and* a daily bullish order block increases the likelihood of the area being probed for liquidity.

### 4. Understanding Opening Prices

*   **Midnight Opening Price:** The opening price of the candle at midnight New York time.
*   **8:30 AM Opening Price:** The opening price of the candle that begins at 8:30 AM. The speaker emphasizes that *any* candle timeframe can be used (1-minute, 3-minute, hourly, etc.), as long as it begins at 8:30 AM.

**Bearish Scenario Considerations:**

*   **Manipulation:** If bearish, ideally the market trades *above* the 8:30 AM opening price (a "Judas Swing").
*   **Targeting:** Expect the market to move lower, potentially below the relative equal lows and towards the daily bullish order block.

**Important Note:** Probabilities are not guarantees. Risk management (stop losses) is essential.

### 5. Refining Targets with Fibonacci and Swing Trading Model

A 15-minute timeframe is used to refine potential targets. The speaker revisits a previously taught swing trading model, applying it to target identification.

*   **Swing Low Break:** A decisive break of a swing low indicates a willingness to move lower.
*   **Fair Value Gap:** Trading back up into an imbalance (fair value gap) after the swing low break.
*   **Fulcrum Point Measurement:** Measuring the distance from the highest body of a swing high to the lowest body of a swing low.

**Fibonacci Application:**

*   **Anchoring:** Anchor the Fibonacci retracement tool to the *bodies* (open or close) of the candles, *not* the wicks or tails.
*   **Settings:** Specific Fibonacci settings are used (implied to be shown in video).
*   **Target Projection:** Project the measured distance (using Fibonacci) downwards to identify potential targets below broken swing lows.

**Target Examples (Based on June 2022 S&P Futures Contract):**

*   **Target 1:** 4514.50
*   **Target 2:** 4501.25

**Justification for Targets:** The speaker addresses criticisms of using numerous lines on a chart. He emphasizes that 4501.25 is just below the daily bullish order block at 4504. This precision is more meaningful when combined with other elements of analysis. In this example, the daily low reached 4501.25.

**Precision and Narrative:** The precision of these targets is only valuable when combined with a broader narrative:

*   Market likely to go lower due to running relative equal highs on the daily chart.
*   Formation of a swing high and aggressive break lower.
*   Likelihood of trading into the daily bullish order block.
*   Retracement that closes the imbalance between the low and high of the relevant candles.

### 6. Combining Elements for High-Probability Setups

Further analysis on the 15-minute timeframe:

*   **Opening Price:** Again emphasizes the importance of both midnight and 8:30 AM opening prices.
*   **Daily Chart Bias:** Emphasizes that the majority of analysis should be framed on the *daily* chart to determine the likely direction (higher or lower).
*   **Premium Build-up:** The market builds a premium before breaking aggressively lower.

**Confirmation Checklist:**

*   **Displacement Down:** A strong move down.
*   **Swing Low Taken Out:** Did the displacement take out a swing low?
*   **Imbalance Trade:** Did price trade up into an imbalance (fair value gap)?
*   **Opening Price Trade:** Did price trade above the opening price?

Checking off these "boxes" significantly increases the probability of a bearish scenario.

**Sequence of Events:**

1.  Market breaks lower.
2.  Trades down to old swing low (sell-side liquidity).
3.  Aggressively rebalances (moves back up).
4.  Trades into bearish order block.
5.  Sells off in another wave, breaking short-term lows.
6.  Eventually trades into the daily bullish order block during/after lunch hour.

The speaker then mentions real money real results where the speaker showed actual live account results. The speaker also appreciates all the feedback in the commentary section of each video.

### 7. Addressing Questions about Multiple Trades

The speaker addresses questions about his statement regarding "no more than four trades: two in the morning, two in the afternoon." He clarifies he read one commenter that stated it was difficult to find those opportunities multiple times in a week.


Okay, here's the re-organized and refined text, broken down into logical sections with clear headings, bullet points where appropriate, and key terms highlighted in **bold**. Every detail is preserved, and the original tone is maintained while improving clarity and coherence.

## Refining Entry Points and Understanding Market Dynamics

### 1. Examining Price Action on Different Timeframes

*   A return **right back up into it about the opening price** is what it would look like on a **5-minute chart**.
*   Notice it does not look as clean as it does on the **15-minute timeframe**.
*   Referencing a gap and a run at 9:30 on the chart.
*   **The 15-minute timeframe** provides the framework and context.
*   "Okay, this is all we need. We don't need it to trade up into that (referencing the gap). It could, but we don't need it to."

### 2. Analyzing Market Behavior After Initial Breakdown

*   When it trades up there, then it starts to break down.
*   It rebalances and breaks down again.
*   Works into that short-term low.
*   Sells off again.
*   Retracement.
*   Sells off again.
*   Entry at the opening.

### 3. Navigating Volatility at the Opening

*   In the morning session, there are typically two to three setups because of volatility coming in at the opening (9:30 New York Local Time).
*   The opening can be very tricky.
*   One can get caught up in the initial volatility and offside real quick.
*   It can run against you aggressively and hurt you.
*   Preferred method: Students should look for the initial move to qualify expectations for lower prices.
*   Confirmation of lower prices enables participation with bias and multiple setups.

### 4. Lower Timeframe Analysis for Entry Refinement

*   Here's the **one-minute chart**.
*   Here's that return back up into the fair value gap in the **15-minute timeframe.**
*   It wasn't so clear on the **5-minute chart**, but now look what we have here.
*   Small little imbalance there, that fair value gap right above a short-term high.
*   We trade up into that.
*   On a **one-minute chart**, you would see that as a setup for the **one-minute chart**.

### 5. Importance of Active Learning and Participation

*   Pause the video.
*   Acknowledges some viewers' tendency to rush through content.
*   This is when you want to stop and slow down because you will cheat yourself out of learning.
*   These are the little moments, like when teaching a private group, these are these opportunities.
*   If you waste them, you do not learn the best way.
*   There's a good way of learning, and there's the best way of learning, and the best way is actually participating, not just casually watching.
*   Don't "Netflix binge-watch" ICT.
*   Stop the video and ask your spouse or whoever to give you a couple of minutes to focus undisturbed.
*   Pull out the things that are being shown in this lesson.
*   Otherwise, it's just another event where I'm talking about hindsight.
*   Showing something that repeats every single day.
*   This is how I can go in every single day and take money out of the marketplace.
*   Took the live account up another thousand dollars today, so we're over fifty-one thousand dollars.
*   These are the types of setups that you can do.
*   You can find these, and you don't have to have the absolute perfect entry at the opening; you don't need that.
*   That's the benefit of what I'm sharing here publicly.
*   I want you all to have the ability to feed yourself and your own family, not to rely on a job.
*   If you look for these types of setups with this logic, I am confident that you can do what I just said.
*   Those that really want to supercharge it can take it way beyond that.

### 6. Leveraging Fulcrum Points and Identifying Opportunities

*   Referencing "that old short-term low."
*   Extended the line out because it doesn't exist in the chart over here because I don't have enough of the data showing.
*   That short-term low was a fulcrum point; remember that's this low here.
*   Referencing that zone; that there's where the sell-side liquidity is.
*   Pause the video and go through this price action.
*   Find the setups that you would see as a shorting opportunity if your bias was in line with what I'm suggesting here as it should have been being bearish.
*   Continuing the conversation; if you are not ready, you've missed your opportunity.

### 7. Applying Fair Value Gaps for Short Entries and Target Setting

*   The first fair value gap is here, right there, because we have this short-term low broken with the run lower.
*   There's displacement there, obvious displacement, very energetic.
*   This candle is high, this candle is low, and the market returns back up into it.
*   You can go short there and look for what's the first objective: that fulcrum point, that short-term low.
*   Aim for the liquidity, so your target would be there.
*   Doing two contracts; entry short here, take one off here, let it ride, and then see if you can get that lower timeframe objective later in the day.
*   Do not want to take entries during the lunch hour between noon and 1 o'clock.
*   You can take profits if you're doing like a partial.
*   If you did two short contracts here, you took one off at your first target and you want to see if you can get the other objective.
*   If you have a limit order at the order block level plus a couple of points, it could feel during the lunch hour.
*   You don't need to be babysitting it being in front of it then because you've already funded your position and trade by taking one off and moving your stop to break even and to see what it can yield in terms of the daily range.
*   Another one is here: another short-term low taken, fair value gap there.
*   We trade back up into it, that's a short, you can go short here and again same premise looking for the first run below here that will be your target taken there.
*   If you did multiple contracts, you would get short here, take two, take one off.
*   This might scare you, not so much probably if you were short from up here, but here could be a little bit intimidating.
*   If you've taken one of the contracts off below here, even if it were to come back up and take you out and stop you out, the first contract allows you to be profitable, so it kind of balances things out.
*   Another one is here: we have the imbalance here after we aggressively move lower and then retrace back up.
*   Referencing if one was short from "up here" wouldn't be worried about this one so much because your stop would be above here.
*   It got close to it, but there have been many trades over the years where it moved within a quarter of a point without stopping me out.
*   It's a scary feeling, especially you have a lot of size behind your positions at the time you're in the trade.
*   It's still a little intimidating because if you completely fulfill your model and follow it in all the roles and you don't want to move your stop and you just allow the stock to be taken.
*   There's been many instances in my own trading where within a quarter point it doesn't stop me out.
*   Not like Forex; these markets are a little bit more professional in the sense that they're much more precise and uniform in the delivery.
*   You don't get these wild erratic little spikes and spreading of the price action because everybody's working with the same price here.
*   Versus in Forex, you're trading within a pool of liquidity within your broker's in-house, and they have a little bit of luxury there where they can open that spread on you, and that's why it's a little bit trickier to operate in that versus something like this market here.
*   Doesn't mean I don't love Forex; still I do, but right now Forex is just quiet; it's not doing things that I would promote in my students' attention.
*   Telling all students both in my private group and publicly that these are the markets that you should be following, these index features.
*   There'll be a time when we transition from index features back to Forex, but until I see them loosen up a little bit in the currencies, my attention is here.
*   Getting short here, this is a shallow run below that old low, so we anticipate it to run a little bit deeper, and it does.
*   You could take profits below this low here as a partial.
*   Seeing multiple opportunities within the same morning session.
*   Showing how if you miss your entry, how can you get back in line with the marketplace and still participate in these moves.
*   There are going to be days where we don't have this many retracements back and back and back and then goes lower; it'll be just one or two, and it just keeps on going.
*   Many times it'll be just right at the opening and that's it; you missed it; it just goes right to where you thought it was going to go for the day.
*   You can't get mad about that; you should be happy that your analysis concepts are speaking to you with that much clarity.
*   Just know that because they repeat, none of you should be upset that you missed the trade; like none of you, nobody has the permission.
*   You have no right to be angry about missing a trade because they are like buses, mass transit buses that come by like a schedule, you know, every certain time of the hour a day.
*   These buses are going to come around; these trades are just like that; you can set your clock to them.
*   They're gonna form, they're gonna be there.
*   Your number one goal is to understand where is it likely to go to, where is it likely to reach for.
*   If you have that understood, it becomes so easy to know what you're looking for.
*   It becomes easy to know what you are looking for.
*   It's not so easy for you to make money. There's a strong contrast there.
*   By default over time, once you have been doing the things that lead to you understanding what is you're looking for and that part becomes easier, what do you think the default result was going to be from that?
*   It's probably going to be easier for you to make money over time.
*   Keeping things in balance that we understand what I'm saying without sugarcoating it and making it sound like anybody can walk in here and do this.
*   It's going to take some effort.

### 8. PM Session Analysis: Liquidity Pools and Algorithm Behavior

*   Looking at that pink rectangle, asking yourself what the heck is that?
*   That is the **PM session** buy-side liquidity pool.
*   This high here was the most energetic one in the morning session; it took us all the way down to what target we were looking for, the **daily bullish order block**.
*   Because it's Friday, because it hit the **daily timeframe objective**, it's in a discount market, it's really traded lower end of week, there's going to be a retracement back into the weekly range.
*   What can it aim for?
*   Aim for the liquidity resting right here because a lot of people are going to say well, you know, this is the place where my stop should be at because I want to hold on to this thing over the weekend.
*   Don't know who has the courage to do that anymore with all the things going on around the world.
*   Personally, I don't have the courage to hold over the weekend.
*   It's just too many things can go wrong.
*   Not sitting in a potential opportunity where it's a thousand-point gap against me, you know, we start trading on Sunday.
*   This area here is where you would anticipate on Fridays where liquidity could be a draw because it's going to likely pull back up into a premium.
*   Here's 8:30, here's the turning point at the 9:30 rotation.
*   So this high or we could use this high here, it doesn't make a difference, but using this one because framing the logic because this day being bearish.
*   This high down to the target; if you put a Fibonacci on this low to high and find the 50 level, this is above 50, so that means above here that's a premium.
*   The market is going to move from what a discount to a premium.
*   That's what the market does; that's the algorithm does.
*   It seeks discount to premium, premium to discount.
*   Within that logic, the market is reaching for liquidity in the form of buy stops and sell stops and/or imbalances or the creation of an imbalance, fair value gaps, or returning back to a fair value gap.
*   That's all these algorithms do, and they do it on the basis of time then price.
*   That's a gross oversimplification, but by far and large, that's all these things do.
*   It's not buying and selling pressure, it's not the effects of the DOM.
*   I got a lot of people asking me because they watched me show things in my live account and they think I traded with the DOM.
*   I don't trade with the DOM; I'm not looking at the DOM trying to read how many orders are resting above or below because there's spoofing that goes on and those orders may not be there when the price goes there.
*   I don't think that the DOM is something that is useful.
*   I'm only throwing that in here because I saw a lot of people in the comments asking about those types of things, and I don't use them.
*   I don't use them in my trading, and I don't think there's anything in terms of advantage in using it.
*   If you believe you're being profitable because you are, don't let my comment change your mind.
*   I'm not trying to open up a dialogue for debate because you're never going to convince me.
*   You're okay if you're using it, but I'm answering students or viewers, and that's my opinion.
*   I'm not trying to begin a debate about it.
*   We have a **PM session** buy-side liquidity pool that the market could likely reach up into.
*   The logic is we move from this high down to a target; it's Friday, there's probably going to be position squaring, they're going to want to take the market back higher, so what are they going to reach for as an opposing move.
*   This was the target; there's going to be short covering.
*   Who's short covering?
*   The smart money that's sold short here, here, here, here, here, and here.
*   If they're covering a short, are they bearish still?
*   No.
*   If they're not bearish, what are they?
*   Bullish.
*   If they're going to be smart money and buy down here or if they're going to use this imbalance in here if it trades down into that, you can see it run higher.
*   If they're going to buy it, what are they going to target?
*   The buy stops up here.
*   They're going to sell right to those buy stops; they're buying this and selling it to these waiting buyers and their buy stops.
*   Notice these relative equal lows.
*   They take it into the order block right below those relative equal lows because it sells what it sells the retail crowd that this was support broken.
*   What are they going to want to do when it trades back up into these relative equal lows?
*   Sell, that creates more liquidity for buying.
*   This is engineering buy-side liquidity on the basis of sell-side flow.
*   Sellers coming in the marketplace.
*   These sellers, they're going to have a counterparty in the form of smart money buying it.
*   They want to sell short because they see relative equal lows breaking, the trend's been down, everything looks bearish to them because it's been going down all day long.
*   When it's only traded down to where the algorithm says this is what we wanted and now we're going to reprice higher.
*   We're going to move from a discount to a premium.
*   The premium intraday is going to be this area here, and that's going to be where the market draws to for the afternoon session buy-side liquidity.
*   Was going to do the pause the video type thing here, but this is going to be a long video.


Okay, here's the re-organized and refined text, broken down into logical sections with clear headings, bullet points where appropriate, and key terms highlighted in **bold**. Every detail is preserved, and the original tone is maintained while improving clarity and coherence.

## Analyzing Market Structure and Liquidity for Intraday Trading

### 1. Identifying Buying Opportunities: Mitigation Blocks and Imbalances

*   We have a **mitigation block** here, which I teach on the YouTube channel.
*   We have **market structure breaking**.
*   Price comes back down into the **mitigation block**.
*   We also have the **imbalance** here; it got there.
*   Therefore, we can be a buyer here, remembering the **4532-4540 level**.
*   Referencing a high on the chart and price ranges trading up into it.
*   **Buying here** and aiming for the **liquidity** up there.
*   That would be your target from buying to getting out there, **selling to those waiting buy stops**.

### 2. Understanding Old Highs as Discount Arrays

*   The market trades down.
*   Go into your chart; I left this out for your personal study.
*   If you look to the left, you'll see an **old high**.
*   **Old highs** are a **discount array**.
*   If we trade above an **old high**, that old high becomes a **discount array**.
*   This is where, not all the time, but this is where old highs being broken become support.
*   That's why sometimes the books have it right; that's why sometimes your analysis will be right about specific key highs and lows, but notice they're not always consistent, and that's the problem.
*   You want to know what makes an **old high** or an **old low** real supportive or resistance when you have the logic I'm framing here.
*   We know the likelihood of the market's going to draw up into this area here because that's where the **buy stops** are resting above the marketplace when it hit the order block down here.
*   The market's going to bounce from here up into this vicinity here, so if the market comes back down and touches, it could have touched this high here, but there's an **old high** to the left.
*   It trades down and hits that, and it also fills in an imbalance.
*   When you have that, **old highs** broken will act as support, so there's something for your notes.
*   Then we have the run-up into that area, so it's not a bad little run.

### 3. Analyzing Market Structure Shifts and Fair Value Gaps for Selling Opportunities

*   Once we get up into that shaded pink area, what have we done? We fulfilled **buy-side liquidity** in this area here, but we have a little bit more later on, which obviously you can see it runs to.
*   Here, we see it do a run lower.
*   We break below a swing low, **market structure shifts**.
*   Are there any imbalances in here? No, but there is one right there.
*   Here's your **fair value gap**.
*   **Shift in market structure** there retraces back up into the **fair value gap**.
*   You can be a seller there and aim for this low or the **order block**.
*   Or you can wait for a confirmation entry, which is we turn here after it hits that **fair value gap**, breaks lower, and then we have another break in the structure of the marketplace on the **one-minute chart**, creates the **imbalance** here.
*   Trades up, it overshoots it, but we also have two **fair value gaps**.
*   Remember the rules I gave you: if you have a **fair value gap** and a small one right above it, anticipate it likely trading up into you, but use this as your entry.
*   Go short here and aim for the **order block**.

### 4. Integrating Time, Liquidity, and Market Structure for Trading Decisions

*   If you have an understanding of how we're going to work within the intraday volatility using **liquidity**, using the **time of day**, using the **day of the week**, all these things come together, and they make a really beautiful tapestry so you can read price action.

### 5. Backtesting and Chart Annotation for Skill Development

*   I know there's a large number of you that are going to watch this, and it's going to feel and seem like obviously anybody can go back in time and do these types of things, but a lot of my trades, when you see my examples and you see the things I record and show you, they're using logic like this.
*   It's not contrived; it's not form-fitted; it's not cherry-picked for the purpose of just being something to talk about. This is what you're looking for.
*   When you do your **backtesting** (I got a lot of questions in the comment section about this as well), you go through your charts just like I'm doing here, and you annotate them.
*   In all these areas where there's empty space here, or over here, or over here, you're putting in little notations, and you're typing them out.
*   Yes, it takes time.
*   Yes, it's tedious.
*   Yes, it takes a great deal of effort and desire, but this stuff rewards that; like it rewards it.
*   It's not like fantasy football where, you know, who cares if your team wins; this pays you.
*   This is something that you can feed your family with, okay?
*   If you need your expenses to be reduced and you don't want to get on a job, or you're, you know, you take a pay cut, maybe you had a, you know, job loss or whatever, this skill set can fortify any weak links in your financial chain, okay?
*   You want to build strength in your ability to make income and build legacy wealth.
*   It's worthwhile for you to spend time learning this, and that means going back through old charts and old moves and literally going in and annotating the moves like this and mapping them out and seeing the logic that's there.
*   Do not be afraid that you're going to do it wrong.
*   All of you are going to be doing it wrong in the beginning.
*   This is a skill set in backtesting; you're trying to discover, okay?
*   You're not trying to do things correctly in backtesting; backtesting is you in a mode of discovery that proves efficacy.
*   If you can't see things repeating, then you got to go back into the core content lessons of this YouTube channel and figure out what it is I'm teaching conceptually.
*   Once you understand better what it is I'm showing you, then you go back into the old data and look for those very things occurring.
*   Then highlight the things in your chart that make the most sense to you over time doing it.
*   Frankly, you should be doing this at least a minimum of a year, okay?
*   Make it a practice of doing all that, even when you start trading with live funds; your trade journal should always have annotations, you should always have charts saved, and just constantly referring to what you witnessed in price and record it like you saw it happening and knew it was going to happen in advance.
*   That's called **self-talk**, okay?
*   You're literally tricking your brain into seeing your annotations as something that you foreseen coming, and that way, when you go back and you read your journal and you study it on the weekends, or you know, whenever you go through a period of drawdown and you need encouragement, you go back to your charts in your journal, and you'll see annotations that you wrote out yourself, and it tricks your brain believing that you've seen that all along.
*   What happens by doing that over time is you have created creases in your brain where that knowledge and that pseudo-experience has been retained, but your brain remembers it as a real experience that you endured, but you're recording it with positive reinforcement in your commentary.
*   Never put negative comments in your annotation.
*   Don't say like, "Oh, I was stupid, I missed this." "Oh, I'm so dumb, I fell victim to the shark pattern."
*   You don't do all that kind of stuff.

### 6. Focusing on Core Principles: Liquidity, Imbalances, and Time

*   You don't have to worry about swimming with sharks.
*   You don't have to worry about animal patterns.
*   You don't need to be worried about any of those types of things.
*   All you're looking for is **liquidity**, **imbalances**, **time of day**.
*   That's it.
*   That's it.
*   That's all this game is all about, okay?
*   The algorithm is not going to try to follow some retail logic stuff; it's based on where is the money, where's the money, who's the most easy prey right now, and where is the majority of the money, and that's where it's going to run for.
*   That's all it's going to do.
*   If you strip everything you think you know about the markets away and just give me a couple months, stay with me for a couple months here, and I promise you, you will put everything else down and see it like this because this is the truth, this is the perfect understanding of what makes these markets book, that means what makes them go up and down, where they turn, why they go where they go, why are they moving when they move, and why are they arriving when they arriving at that price point.
*   It's all algorithmic, and it has absolutely nothing to do with ratios.
*   It has nothing to do with anything harmonic, nothing supply and demand zone, nothing to do with Elliott Wave, nothing to do with White Golf, nothing to do with Gan.
*   None of that stuff has anything to do with it.
*   I literally have just explained exactly what these markets do.
*   That's it; there's nothing else that happens.
*   The buying and selling pressure, it's a myth because these markets are going to go higher regardless of how many contracts come in.
*   If they want this thing to go up here, it doesn't require millions of contracts to put it there, it doesn't.
*   How many contracts does it take for this candle to move from that opening price to that closing price?
*   Tell me how many cam how many contracts does it take for that to happen?
*   It only needs two, two transactions.
*   Two transactions: one here, and when it gaps up here and reprices to that price point, and it offers it to the market, that price, and someone comes in with a market order, what happens?
*   Boom, it's it the candle has been created.
*   Two trades.
*   How many contracts?
*   It doesn't make a difference.
*   You only need a transaction.

### 7. Open-Minded Learning and Consistency

*   Listen, you can sit down and listen to these videos I'm producing and come with the preconceived notion that everything I'm saying is nonsense, it's not true, and it's not valid because you don't want it to be.
*   All I'm asking you to do is put everything you think you understand, put it aside for a moment, just for a little while, and go in and do the things I'm telling you to do.
*   I guarantee you, you will absolutely fall in love with this because this is consistency.
*   This is consistency that you have always hoped for, but everything else just falls short in delivering it, and you're getting it for free, and I'm loving it while giving it to you because I know and you're all going to see it when all these little light bulbs come on and all the people watching these videos.
*   This channel is growing; it's growing, and this train's going to keep on rolling.
*   This community is getting bigger and bigger because it's infectious.
*   Results matter, proof matters, and when students go into this and they see the results, man, it's sweet, isn't it?
*   Isn't it sweet when you see the truth finally just laid out in front of you?
*   There's no trickery here; there's no twisting of your arm, give me your credit card payment.
*   You don't you don't have to blow any kisses to me, okay?
*   I don't need flowers; I just want you to make a real effort and then tell me what your results are.
*   What did you get from it?
*   I promise you, I'm promising you, you will find what you're looking for, but you got to put the work into it because if you don't put the work into it, it won't matter because you'll just think it's too much work.
*   I'm telling you, it only feels like a lot of work in the beginning, but once you understand what you're looking for, like this setup here, that might be your particular setup, and this up here isn't your setup.
*   This might be your setup here because it's based on that **old high**.
*   You'll find, if you scroll back on your own chart, that might be your setup and not this one down here.
*   That's what I'm referring to when I say when you find your **unique model**, that means a setup that is so similar every time you take it, it repeats the same general idea just in a different chart, on a different day, in a different time frame.
*   That's it.
*   That's all it is.

### 8. Developing Your Unique Trading Model

*   That's a that's your **unique model**.
*   You're learning how to do it with what I'm teaching you, but where you're looking for it, in what market, and what narrative that you're looking for, what makes that setup your particular setup.
*   That's a unique thing for you, and that's the weird, beautiful element to trading, and the way these markets operate is it allows each and every one of us to have our own **unique model**.
*   We can all use the things I'm teaching and all find setups within the same trading day and be opposed to every individual trade setup individually.
*   We could all be doing something and not agree with any of it.
*   You took a short there; I was long a little while before that, or I went short and you went along somewhere else, and you're ending a trade where I'm getting ready to put on a trade.
*   It's amazing, but how you internalize the market, what setup you're looking for, there's lots of them.
*   If you break this chart down into a 30-second chart or a 15-second chart, there's even more setups.
*   Everything's fractal, so if you want to do high-frequency trading, you can do that with the second chart.
*   You may not be able to pull up second charts because you may not have the, I guess, the subscription level on TradingView, and I don't get any subscription kickbacks; I'm not trying to get you to buy anything from TradingView; I'm just stating that you can make this however you want.
*   If you just want to stay on a 15-minute chart and trade a daily range, okay, there's no reason to do anything less than that.
*   If you want to get busy and pyramid your positions, that means like say you bought one down here, or say you bought say about five down here, and you bought three here, and you bought two here, and then you roll it up into your objective, that's pyramiding your biggest position put on first, then a smaller position on, and then a smaller position, and then that that's how you build up the equity and you get velocity in your equity growth that way versus buying one, then buying two, then buying forward, and buying eight.
*   That that is reckless, and I've done that, and I've roasted accounts doing it, so don't do that.

### 9. Review of Key Concepts and Encouragement

*   Hopefully, this has at least got your gears turning about how you can go in and backtest a little bit, how you can see multiple trade setups, and how we can work with higher time frame **PD arrays** and the **PD array matrix** where it's **discount to premium** and **premium to discount**, and how we use and incorporate all the different arrays where I'm sure someone new watching this, your head's spinning right now; you're like, "I have a thousand questions right now, and I I need to know this."
*   No, you don't need to know what you're asking for right now; you only feel like you need to know right now.
*   Take the things I'm showing you at the pace I'm showing you, study them, and I promise a couple months from now, you're going to know a whole lot more than you know right now, and you'll be able to go in and see things in price action that you don't even identify right now, even in hindsight.
*   You just got to give yourself the time and give yourself the real effort to learn this.
*   I've stripped it down; I made it as streamlined as I possibly could, and I promise you will get this, and until I'll talk to you next time, be safe.

Okay, here's the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining all original details and nuances while improving readability:

# Forex Trading Model Application

## Introduction

**Video URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WIqHJDQ_p4

Welcome back, folks! This lesson focuses on applying the trading model to the **Forex (FX)** market.
*   For longtime students, much of this will be familiar.
*   Newer students may find some concepts challenging, but most information is already available in the **free lessons** on this YouTube channel.

## Euro/Dollar Daily Chart Analysis

### Identifying Key Levels
Let's analyze the **Euro/Dollar (EUR/USD)** daily chart. Notice how price moved above the **relative equal highs.**
*   This action took out the **buy-side liquidity** (buy stops) in the market.
*   Subsequently, the price started trending downward.

**Question:** Where is price likely headed next? Since buy-side liquidity was taken, the market is likely targeting **sell-side liquidity** (sell stops) below.

### Examining Relative Equal Lows
Observe the **relative equal lows**.
*   These represent areas of **sell-side liquidity**.
*   Monday's (yesterday's) candle didn't take out the low of those relative equal lows.
*   This indicates "**unfinished business**" exists below those levels.

### Determining Bias
Despite three consecutive down close candles from a high, the immediate bias for the next candle is **bearish**. The anticipation is for a continuation of the downward movement.

### Annotated Chart Importance
It is important to use annotated charts to highlight important levels when you're in the learning process.
*   These annotations are crucial for training your eye to identify key levels.
*   Over time, you'll only need a pad and pen to jot down important levels.
*   The instructor typically keeps charts clean, avoiding unnecessary biases. Levels are only shown for **teaching purposes**.
*   Clarity allows for the negation of the initial premise and quick reactions to new information or changing market conditions.

### Understanding Buy Stops and Smart Money
*   **Relative equal highs** indicate buy stops resting above.
*   The market briefly moves above these highs, triggering buy stops.
*   This surge of buy orders acts as counterparty to **smart money** selling short.
*   Smart money anticipates price moving below key lows.

### Today's Trading Action
*   The market opens, rallies slightly, then moves through the short-term low and the relative equal lows (though not by much).
*   The expectation is the market will draw to the **1.09 big figure level** if the market looks for further lower prices.
*   This big figure level is a high influential area for liquidity.

### The Influence of Big Figure Levels
**Big figure numbers** (zero levels) are highly influential due to the liquidity associated with them.

*   **Institutional price levels:** These levels include:
    *   00 levels
    *   20 levels
    *   50 levels
    *   80 levels

These levels are covered in the free videos.

---

## Swing Trading Idea Revisited

### Identifying Swing Points
Revisiting the swing trading idea:
*   **Highest up close or opening** in this retracement up.
*   **Lowest open or close**.
*   Highlight these candles to match them on your chart.
*   **Old low** as reference point.

### Potential Price Targets
If price breaks below the old low, how far could it fall?

*   **1.  09 big figure** is a key target.

**Fibonacci Analysis:**
*   1.  0919
*   2.  09
*   3.  0901 (almost the big figure)

These levels represent standard deviations from the swing. These levels only apply *if* the low is broken.

**Key terms:**
*   Fulcrum Point
*   Falcon Point

### Determining Target Selection
How do we choose the target?
*   Consider **relative equal lows** at the **1.09 big figure level**.
*   Fibonacci analysis suggests alternative levels, with the lowest being the one just above 1.09.

---

## Hourly Chart Analysis

### Buy-Side Liquidity Pool
*   The market trades up into the **buy-side liquidity pool**.
*   This absorbs liquidity before breaking down.
*   Price takes out short-term lows.
*   Retraces up and breaks lower again.

### Anticipating Movement

Prior to the day starting, the expectation is for price to move towards the **1.09 big figure**, attacking the liquidity below.

### Protraction: The Judas Swing
*   Ideally, price will rally first.
*   This upward move is a "**Judas Swing**" (market protraction).
*   This is the manipulation phase within the instructor's **Power 3 concept (Accumulation, Manipulation, Distribution).**

### Daily Trading Plan
*   At midnight New York local time, anticipate an upward move.
*   The market will trade into an **imbalance**.
*   This will likely form the **daily high**.
*   Look for **distribution** throughout the day, targeting lower prices.

### Shaded Area
Focus on the shaded area for further analysis.

---

## Lower Time Frame Analysis: 15-Minute Chart

### Imbalance Identification

The imbalance (though less clear on this timeframe) is still present. The hourly is what we're framing it on.

### Midnight Candle Reference
*   The market trades up into that imbalance.
*   Midnight New York local time candle marks the start of the day.
*   If shorting, look for price to trade *above* this opening price.
*   This is where smart money accumulates short positions.
*   The algorithm pushes price higher repeatedly before descending.

### Time and Price Combination

*   Price movement *alone* isn't enough to trigger a trade.
*   Combining price action with **time of day** improves the analysis.

### Fair Value Gap & Bearish Order Block

*   An **imbalance (fair value gap)** is present.
*   Price runs up during the **New York Open kill zone**.
*   Market overshoots the imbalance, reaching the last closed (bearish) candle (a **bearish order block**).
*   *Reasoning:* There's a fair value gap and the price is retracing after a move lower.

---

## Five-Minute Chart & New York Open Kill Zone

### Confirmation on Lower Timeframe
On the 5-minute chart, the order block is confirmed.
*   **New York Open Kill Zone:** 7:00 AM - 10:00 AM New York time (specific to Forex pairs).
*   During this zone, actively hunt for setups.

### Identifying High Probability Setups

**Conditions for shorting:**
*   Price at or just above the opening price at midnight.
*   If a New York session trader, consider recalibrating at 8:30 AM.

### News Driver: ISM Services PMI
*   A high impact news event is happening at 10:00 AM (ISM Services PMI).
*   *The instructor doesn't focus on the specifics of the news data itself*.
*   The expectation is volatility around that time.
*   The algorithm utilizes this volatility for trade facilitation.

### The Rigged Game
*   The market is rigged.
*   The algorithm is trying to move and rebook and reprice to levels to allow those in the know to participate.
*   It's not designed to provide consistently profitable trades for everyone.
*   "Those in the know" look for specific price action signatures, combined with time.

### Technician's Approach
*   Technicians look for specific time elements (7:00 AM - 10:00 AM).
*   They hunt for setups within this bracket of time.
*   High probability thresholds must be met for trading consideration.
*   If shorting, look for a move *above* the midnight opening price.

### Market Dynamics
*   The market drops after hitting the order block during the early New York Open.
*   Retraces back up into the news driver at 10:00 AM.

### Analyzing Intermediate Term Highs

*   The swing low moves below a previous low before rallying back above the midnight opening price.
*   The high is not taken out because there is an imbalance there.
*   This imbalance indicates the presence of an "intermediate term high" (as previously discussed around Episode 12 in a recent video).
*   This narrative supports bearish expectations.

### Order Block and News Events

*   The retracement into the bearish order block (last up close candle) ahead of the news creates an optimal shorting opportunity.
*   A swing high forms (lower high to the right and left).
*   A shift in market structure occurs and retraces back up to the fair value gap and bearish order block, but the news acts as a wild card.
*   This volatility can scare you or trigger your stop loss.

### Stop Loss Placement

*   If shorting, protect your trade by placing a buy stop above recent swing highs.
*   This protects against getting hit with news volatility.
*   The algorithm is looking to facilitate trades for "smart money".
*   Buy stops trigger buyers to flood the market (counterparty to smart money selling short).
*   Every buy requires a seller, and every sell requires a buyer.

### Applying the Model

The core goal is to demonstrate how the model applies in FX.

---

## Four-Minute Chart: Fair Value Gap and Objective

### Identifying a Fair Value Gap

*   Stripping down this price leg to search for any fair value gaps.
*   The low of one candle to the high of another will indicate the presence of a fair value gap.

**Result:** Price moves into the gap, closes it, and then the market aggressively runs below the short-term low.

### Reaching the Objective

*   The market reaches the objective, the 1.09 big figure.
*   While it doesn't quite hit 1.09, it reaches the Fibonacci extension for the standard deviation.
*   Price moves down to the old relative equal lows on the daily chart (represented by the blue line).
*   The bodies of the candles respect that level.

---

## Addressing Raw Dog Concerns

### Simplifying the Model
*   The instructor acknowledges some may find the model too complex.

### Midnight vs. 8:30 Opening Price
**Question:** Which opening price to use (midnight vs. 8:30)?

**Answer:**

*   Use the **8:30 AM** opening price for New York session FX trades.
*   Also refer to the **midnight** opening price.
*   If the 8:30 AM opening price is *lower* than midnight, use the *lower* one.
*   The 8:30 opening price sets the minimum threshold for the Judas swing or market protraction to the upside when bearish.
*   The opposite is true when bullish and going long.

### Focusing on Shorting

The emphasis remains on shorting opportunities for clarity in understanding the model. Subtle nuances exist in FX trading, but it is not "terribly difficult".


Okay, here's the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining all original details and nuances while improving readability:

## Applying the Trading Model: Forex Example

### Market Protraction and Fair Value Gap

We observed the market trading above the opening price, a **market protraction** (Judas Swing). The market rallied up and then broke down. Let's examine this run above the opening price on the **four-minute chart** for a fair value gap.

*   Anchoring on a **five-minute chart**, the market rallies up and breaks lower.
*   A **fair value gap** is evident.
*   Price trades up into it, reacts strongly, and then displacement trades lower down towards the **1.09 level**.

The target was the **1.09** level.

*  The target was at **1.0901.**
*   The low of the day ended up being **1.0901**.

### Exit Strategy and Managing Spread in Forex

**Important:** Don't aim precisely for a level as an exit strategy. Fluff up your exits by a few pips.

*   Recommendation: Use **three to five pips**.
*   If the target is, for example, **1.0900**, place your limit order to cover your shorts at **1.0905**.

This accounts for the spread.

*   Brokers can widen spreads to their advantage.
*   To mitigate this, add a buffer to your exits.
*   New traders can start with a **10-pip buffer**.

### Stop Loss Placement and Risk-Reward Ratio

**Example Scenario:**

*   Entry point is based on the entry candle trading back to the old high.
*   The stop loss is placed above the high of this candle (or the swing high if you're more conservative).

**Specific Numbers:**

*   Entry price: **1.096**
*   Stop loss: **1.09728**

Even though the stop loss is not technically 10 pips away, it would be rounded to 10 pips for simplicity.

**Risk-Reward Analysis:**

*   Target: A bit above the **1.09** big figure (fluffed up for spread).
*   The model exhibits a risk-to-reward ratio better than **8 to 1**.
*   On a hypothetical **$100,000 demo account**, this single trade could achieve your desired results (e.g., for a funded account challenge).

### Applicability to Different Markets

The trading model is adaptable to different markets:

*   **Forex (FX)**
*   **Index trading**

However, adjustments and rule following are necessary, especially in index trading.

### Time-Based Considerations: New York Open Kill Zone

**New York Open Kill Zone:**

*   **FX pairs:** **7:00 AM to 10:00 AM** New York time.
*   **Index trading:** **8:30 AM to 11:00 AM** New York time.
    *   Trades can be taken up to **10:40 or 10:45**.
    *   Generally, avoid new trades after **10:00 AM** in FX pairs, *unless* there's a news driver.

### High-Impact News Drivers

**High Impact News Drivers**

*   News events such as **ISM Services PMI** can create volatility.
*   While the specifics of the data may not be focused on, the volatility facilitates trading for the algorithm.
*   If unfamiliar with the reaction to news, consider avoiding trading high-impact news events.
*   With an economic counter, a high-impact news driver can extend the New York session kill zone to **11:00 - 11:30**.

### Application in Different Asset Classes

*   **Index futures:** The model works within the **8:30 AM to 11:00 AM** window.
*   **FX:** The model works within the **7:00 AM to 10:00 AM** window.
*   For **Canadian dollar traders**, be mindful of the **crude oil inventory number** (typically released around **10:30 AM**), and anticipate a potential move on that number.

### Final Thoughts

This explanation provides insights into applying the model to FX.

*   Study and review the information multiple times.
*   Some concepts may require further reflection.
*   Keep noteworthy points in your study journal.
*   The model appears effective in this pair/asset class.

### **ICT 2022 YouTube Mentorship - Episode 18: Chart Layout and Analysis**

**Video URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eai0nHhAC8w

**Introduction**

Welcome back to episode 18 of the ICT 2022 YouTube Mentorship series! In this episode, we're diving into the Euro/Dollar and I'll be showcasing how I structure my trade layout using TradingView.

**TradingView Setup**

*   This is what I work with, utilizing my charts through TradingView.
*   Don't be intimidated if you can't replicate this setup immediately, as it might require a specific TradingView membership level.
*   **Disclaimer:** I am not promoting TradingView or affiliated with them. I pay for their service out of my own pocket because I like it.
*   The purpose of showing this is to demonstrate how to streamline analysis, even with a single screen setup.
*   I've received requests from both my private group and the YouTube community to illustrate my chart configuration and analysis process, specifically:

    *   How my charts look when searching for trade setups.
    *   How I navigate from higher to lower time frames.
    *   How I work with daily bias.
    *   How I streamline analysis from high to low time frames.

**Chart Layout Overview**

The **upper left-hand corner** of my chart layout always displays the **daily chart**. This is where I begin my analysis when determining bias.

**Daily Chart Analysis**

*   You can maximize the daily chart to perform your analysis.
*   Shout out to my mentorship group for bringing this up.
*   On Wednesday's midweek commentary, I mentioned a fair value gap with a high, a low, and a higher high.
*   **Important Note:** Many might see this as a bearish breaker, but it isn't. It's important to note the discount low of the fair value gap.
*   The low of the discount low of the fair value gap is lower than the other low, therefore it is not a bearish breaker.

**Prognostication Example: Euro/Dollar**

*   I mentioned to my private group that price would likely rally into that fair value gap and then look for lower prices.
*   I'm sharing this publicly *after* the fact so you understand the context.
*   The intent here is not to convince everyone, but to provide a clear example.

**Applying the YouTube Mentorship Model**

Let's walk through a scenario using the teachings from this YouTube mentorship.

**Addressing a Viewer Question: A Single, Reliable Trading Approach**

*   I responded to a viewer in the comment section (possibly the most recent video) about a specific trading approach that "always hits."
*   **Reality Check:** No trading method hits every single time.
*   Everything I trade and teach is imperfect, leading to losing transactions, often due to the operator (myself or others).
*   Ownership and responsibility are crucial, a topic I lectured on in my private group on Wednesday.
*   If I had to choose a single trading approach to start over with, knowing what I know now, I would choose the model I've created here.
*   The reason why I stripped it all down and created the model like it is and you're going to see more of it being applied here today so it gives you like a a step-by-step approach.
*   It gives a step-by-step approach and allows you to back-test and analyze old data effectively.

**Proving Prognostication Using the Model**

*   It's not a huge trade, but it proves prognostication.
*   It shows that I hinted at a likely downward move.
*   Using this YouTube 2022 mentorship model is the easiest approach.
*   With this model, I wouldn't focus on:

    *   Central Bank Dealer's Range.
    *   Asian Range.
    *   Anything else not explicitly mentioned in this model.

*   This is literally the simplest way to work with intraday and daily order flow.
*   **Important:** This approach is simple but it might not feel "sexy" to some.
*   I want to keep things streamlined and simple, even for someone new to trading.

**Streamlining and Step-by-Step Process**

*   I already revealed the bearish bias on the Euro/Dollar.
*   On Tuesday, I showed an example where it was likely to draw into a low.
*   The model is effective, as profitability is still possible even if price doesn't reach that low.

**How to Responsibly Handle Daily Bias and Frame Setups**

*   **Step 1: Bias is Bearish**
    *   A bearish bias means you're actively looking for short sale opportunities.
    *   Everything discussed until this point is specific to Forex (unless otherwise stated).
*   **Step 2: Daily Chart Analysis**
    *   Start your analysis on the daily chart.
    *   Identify a fair value gap, anticipating a potential rally into that area.
    *   Trading into that fair value gap is the signal you are looking for.
    *   You don't need to be greedy and trade all the way up.
*   **Step 3: Incorporate Time of Day**
    *   Time of day helps you refine your entry criteria.
    *   You don't necessarily need to catch the absolute high.
    *   The important thing is knowing what you're looking for *ahead of time*.
    *   This prevents impulsive intraday swings and changing direction.

**Contextualizing Live Account Statements**

*   When I show three-month live trading account statements, it's important to *listen* to the context.
*   I'm disclosing that I'm answering specific questions from *paying* students.
*   These conversations are private and not directly applicable to everyone.
*   I create similar scenarios in a live account to address their questions:
    *   What to do in drawdown situations.
    *   How to overcome the fear of taking trades.
    *   How to handle losing trades.
*   Some executions are simply demonstrations of overcoming initial fear.
*   It's going to cost you commission and it's going to look like you have no idea what you're doing and there's people out there looking at these statements.
*   The community here wanted to see a live account and you see it, but working within a live account, unless you do things like I'm going to show you here, you're going to have this changing of direction intraday over and back and forth back and forth. You're going to go up, you're going to go down, you're going to go back and forth and then it's gonna draw your account down or worse if you don't control yourself, you'll blow the account.
*   Therefore, you must commit to one direction and that's your bias.

**Bias Imperfection and The Truth**

*   Your bias isn't going to be perfect.
*   News flash: I'm not always perfect with my bias either.
*   A bias is just an idea to work within, filtering out the opposite side of the market.
*   Wait for setups to form that align with your bias, unless proven wrong.
*   There is no secret to remove any chance of you losing.
*   If I had a way to never lose, I would be the richest person ever and never teach it.
*   You don't need to be perfect.

**Risk to Reward Misconceptions and Students Questions**

*   Imperfection can still double an account.
*   You can have a lot of losing trades.
*   This is something that one of my students asked. They said what if your win rate is really really low can you still double an account?
*   I've proven that a risk to reward model isn't essential for profitability with a live account.
*   I have things I'm going to show you with this TD Ameritrade account before the end of the year.
*   I don't need to show you everything to see that account growing.

**Funded Accounts Consideration**

*   What do you do if you're in a live account?
*   Let's address the funded account programs (without naming specifics as there's no affiliation).
*   My opinion of them is I have students that have gone through them and they are funded.
*   Do I believe everyone should do that? I don't personally believe everyone should uh but it is an avenue that you have to consider when you're in your own seat if you want to do that or not.
*   Let's assume you have passed a challenge and now have a $100,000 funded account.
*   If it were me, I would use this model.

**Applying the Model to a $100,000 Funded Account (Hypothetical)**

*   Bearish daily bias, focusing on the daily chart.
*   Looking at recent price action, we had a drop down towards a low.
*   The next day, the candle traded up, creating a fair value gap.
*   After five down days, a retracement is likely due to the discount created.
*   As soon as the fair value gap forms, expect a rally into that area.
*   Trading back to that candle's high can set the stage for selling.
*   Highlight the area on your daily chart.

**Recap of Daily Chart and Target**

*   You had a bearish bias and we're likely to draw down to this low.
*   Reasons: We had 1,2,3 times like I mentioned on the video on Tuesday or episode 17 if I'm not mistaken in this mentorship.
*   The draw on liquidity is on the daily chart.
*   Set your target.
*   But is that your trade target? No not for intraday trading.

### **Understanding Daily Highs and Lows in Trading**

**Focus: Utilizing Previous Day's Data for Intraday Analysis**

This section delves into how to leverage previous daily highs and lows to identify trading opportunities, focusing on institutional mindset and algorithmic behavior.

**1. Identifying Key Levels**

*   **Previous Daily High:** Highlight the high of the previous trading day.
*   **Previous Daily Low:** Highlight the low of the previous trading day.
*   **Example:** Considering Wednesday's (previous day) and Thursday's (current day) trading:

    *   Thursday's trading day opens.
    *   Price rallies, briefly exceeding a short-term high.
    *   This creates an opportunity to target the daily low.

**2. Rationale Behind Targeting Daily Lows**

*   Long positions taken earlier may create targets.
*   There are always buyers and sellers in the market.
*   Institutional mindset traders recognize liquidity around daily highs and lows.
*   High-frequency trading (HFT) algorithms target these levels.

**3. Historical Context**

*   Back in 2009-2010, the initial lesson was to highlight the previous day's highs and lows.
*   Consider the highs and lows of the last three days.
*   This reveals a plethora of potential trading setups.
*   These levels act as liquidity pools that can be targeted.
*   There is always a fresh supply of new setups when considering the last three days' highs and lows.

**4. Framework: Premium and Discount**

*   Represented by the high and low of Wednesday's trading.
*   Before Thursday's trading, your chart would display these levels.
*   Upon entering a fair value gap, look for short opportunities.
*   Target the daily low with the expectation of price movement in that direction.

**5. Profitability Range Example**

*   **High:** 935
*   **Low:** 74 (approximately 60 handles)
*   The above range presents potential profitability.
*   Evaluate if 25, 30, or 40 pips can be extracted from this range.
*   The goal is to determine the existing range of opportunity.

**6. Trading Day Scenario (Thursday)**

*   The market opens.
*   Price rallies and touches the high.
*   Price retraces into a fair value gap.
*   Look for setups taught within this mentorship.

**7. Streamlining Analysis with TradingView**

*   Drop down to lower time frames for refined entries.
*   TradingView allows actions on one chart to reflect across others.
*   This facilitates streamlined analysis.

**8. Single Screen Configuration**

*   The purpose is to show how to streamline analysis even with a single screen setup.
*   Daily Chart: Upper Left
*   Hourly Chart: Lower Left
*   15 Minute Chart: Upper Right
*   Whatever you do on the Daily chart is reflected on the Hourly and 15 minute charts.

**9. Mobile Phone Trading: A Word of Caution**

*   **Recommendation:** Do not enter brand new positions on your phone.
*   Mobile devices offer insufficient data visibility due to compression.
*   Need to see the "lay of the land."
*   Managing a trade on a phone is acceptable.
*   Consistent profitability and trading millions on a phone are unlikely.
*   Real estate on a computer screen is necessary.
*   It requires a little bit of an investment.

**10. Optimizing a One-Screen Setup**

*   Annotations from the daily chart are transposed onto the hourly chart.
*   After analyzing the hourly chart, move to the 15-minute timeframe.
*   Annotations from both daily and hourly charts appear on the 15-minute chart.

**11. Timeframe Focus**

*   **15-Minute Timeframe:** The bellwether chart for quick reference.
*   It provides information for:

    *   Position management.
    *   Identifying new trade setups.
    *   Reinforcing intraday bias.

**12. Daily Chart Workflow (Single Screen)**

*   Annotate the daily chart.
*   Change the screen to the hourly chart.
*   The annotations will carry over.
*   Repeat for the 15-minute timeframe.

**13. Hourly Chart Analysis**

*   Align levels for precise anchoring (personal preference).
*   The imbalance on the daily chart also exists on the hourly chart.
*   Identify relative equal highs.
*   Annotate charts to record the reason for the levels used in the study journal.
*   Screenshot zoomed-in areas for better aesthetic and informational clarity.

**14. 15-Minute Timeframe Analysis**

*   The 15-minute timeframe will display annotations from the daily and hourly charts.
*   This section addresses charting elements, time delineation, and identifying setups.

**15. Charting Elements: Annotating the 15-Minute Chart**

*   Adding Daily Dividers.
*   Vertical lines delineate new trading days at midnight New York time.
*   Vertical lines help users delineate the start of the new trading day (midnight New York Time).
*   Use the favorites bar for quick access to tools in TradingView.
*   To expand the chart and maximize screen use, highlight the star button.

**16. Opening Price at Midnight New York Time**

*   Mark the opening price at midnight New York time.
*   This is the candle at the start of the new day.
*   Plot a horizontal line at the opening price.
*   Extend the line to 11:00 AM New York time.
*   This reference price is used on 15 minute and 5 minute charts.

**17. TradingView Time Zone Setting**

*   Set TradingView charts to New York time, regardless of your location.
*   This ensures alignment with teaching materials and easier pattern recognition.

**18. Model Application on the 15-Minute Chart**

*   New day at midnight New York Time.
*   The market rallies above equal highs.
*   Look for displacement to the downside.
*   Identify imbalances or fair value gaps.

**19. Fair Value Gap Identification**

*   Look for the Fair Value Gap to give a signal when trading on the 15 minute time frame.
*   Identify the swing low.
*   Did it break below?
*   Is there a Fair Value Gap?

**20. New York Session Killzone**

*   **Time:** 7:00 AM to 10:00 AM New York time.
*   Look for setups within this timeframe.
*   The New York killzone runs up into the highs.
*   A displacement to the downside is desired.

**21. Order Placement (Example)**

*   Sell short at 10:00 AM (or plus one pip).
*   Stop-loss above the recent high (or swing high).
*   Target the daily low.

**22. Refining Entries with the 5-Minute Chart**

*   Examine the 5-minute chart within the 15-minute timeframe's range.
*   Look for fair value gaps on the 5-minute chart.
*   This allows for advantageous entry points.
*   The 5 minute is used for fine-tuned entries.

**23. Fair Value Gap Analysis on the 5-Minute Chart**

*   Analyze the decline on the 5-minute chart.
*   Identify any fair value gaps within the range.
*   Consider the minimum threshold for reaching the low.

**24. Timeframe Relationships: Higher vs. Lower**

*   Higher timeframe imbalances are "parent" to subordinate, smaller timeframes.
*   The 15-minute imbalance needs to be exceeded.
*   Then examine lower timeframes (5, 4, 3, 2, and 1-minute) for fine-tuned entries.

**25. Entry Strategy (5-Minute Chart)**

*   Identify imbalances on the 5-minute chart.
*   Place a sell limit order within the imbalance range.
*   Or, wait for the price to rebalance within the range.
*   Individual trading style influences the specific entry point.
*   Being too greedy might result in missing the fill.
*   The strategy presented focuses on a low-threshold entry.
*   However, this may result in the highest risk.

### Understanding and Applying Risk Management and Order Block Concepts

**Focus: Managing Risk, Understanding Order Blocks, and Applying Concepts in Trading**

This section discusses how to effectively manage risk, understand order blocks, and apply trading concepts, particularly within the context of short-term trading.

**1. Risk Management: Prioritizing Pips Over Monetary Value**

*   Risk should be assessed in terms of the number of **pips**, not the monetary amount.
*   Monetary risk is controlled by the trader through **leverage management**.
*   **Leverage abuse** is a common mistake made by traders.
*   Traders often focus solely on potential profits without considering potential losses.
*   Leverage can be counterproductive if not managed correctly, potentially leading to significant losses.
*   The goal is to teach a **low threshold entry** strategy while building perspective for identifying better entries.
*   This perspective helps to reduce the number of pips at risk, especially when trading index futures.

**2. Order Blocks Explained**

*   The presented scenario involves trading within a range, with price trading up into a secondary **fair value gap**.
*   A limit order could be placed at the upper end of the range for a stellar entry, but it's not always necessary.
*   On the 15-minute timeframe, the range contains a **bearish order block**.
*   The bearish order block consists of three consecutive candles.
*   An order block begins with the low of the first candle in the sequence of three.
*   The speaker expresses frustration with inaccurate interpretations of order blocks by others.
*   He emphasizes that true understanding comes from comprehensive knowledge, not just parroting buzzwords.
*   He strongly advises against learning about order blocks from sources other than his teachings.
*   This is to prevent viewers from being misinformed and potentially harmed by incorrect applications.
*   Correctly applied concepts lead to desired results, while incorrect applications lead to frustration and perceived ineffectiveness.
*   **Key Point:** The validity of an order block relies on the presence of an **imbalance**.
*   Without an imbalance, there is no valid order block.
*   Unlike supply and demand, the presented concept isn't reliant on fresh zones and can involve cutting through candles.
*   The speaker distinguishes his teaching from supply and demand theory.
*   He emphasizes the uniqueness of the concepts he teaches.
*   He wishes to see viewers learn the concepts correctly to achieve consistent results and longevity in trading.

**3. Market Context and Order Block Application**

*   Price runs up into a **daily fair value gap**.
*   This run occurs above **relative equal highs** on the hourly chart.
*   The run into the imbalance and above the relative equal highs forms the **bearish order block**.
*   The bearish order block, on the five-minute chart, doesn't necessarily need to reach the last up-closed candle before the down-close.
*   The higher timeframe imbalance (15-minute) stops the price, negating the need to reach the last candle.
*   The speaker considers the imbalance sufficient and doesn't expect the last up-close candle to be traded to.
*   After identifying the order block, another small fair value gap may appear above it.
*   A limit order is placed within the initial fair value gap, anticipating a potential trade-up into the smaller gap.
*   This strategy aims to avoid missing trades by accounting for potential price movements.
*   Placing orders at overly aggressive price points can lead to missed opportunities.
*   The speaker aims to provide consistent, practical setups for practice and backtesting.
*   The discussed levels were previously mentioned in the speaker's private group.
*   The overall bias for the trading pair was bearish, as discussed in a previous mentorship episode.

**4. Refinement and Execution Strategy**

*   A break in the low indicates an **internal shift in market structure to bearish**.
*   The **imbalance** is refined down to the five-minute chart, aligning with the bearish order block.
*   Misconceptions about the importance of the last closed candle are clarified.
*   If a smaller fair value gap exists above the initial one, the stop-loss must account for potential trade-up.
*   The speaker advises against ultra-short-term strategies with very tight stop-losses.
*   While such strategies might work occasionally, they are unreliable with larger positions.
*   Small stop-losses can lead to stress and preoccupation with potential stop-outs.
*   The focus should be on where the market is likely to move, rather than constantly worrying about the stop-loss.
*   In the presented example, the target is the low from April 6th.
*   Price swept the previous day's low (April 6th) during an early morning run.
*   After the sweep, the price rallied and hit the level aligned with the bearish bias.
*   The rally occurred at 9:30 AM New York local time, hitting a premium level.
*   The framework involves a **market structure shift** that disqualifies upper candles.
*   The lower candle serves as the target.
*   A change in the state of delivery is a key indicator.
*   Once the price moves below a candle's open, the market starts delivering sell-side.
*   A break of the swing low confirms the change in delivery.
*   Any subsequent rally is considered a potential setup for further downward movement.
*   The rally is a "suspect rally" and an intermediate-term swing high.
*   The imbalance suggests that the price should not trade higher than that high, providing a logical stop-loss placement.
*   The rules are interconnected and build upon previously taught concepts.
*   The speaker is providing detailed insights that are not commonly available elsewhere.

**5. Order Placement and Kill Zones**

*   The setup provides a good opportunity to go short using a limit entry.
*   If the order doesn't fill by 11:30 AM, it should be cancelled.
*   "Good till cancel" orders are discouraged because market conditions can change.
*   **Kill zones** are specific time windows for identifying order placement opportunities.
*   The order idea and placement need to be considered within the kill zone.
*   If no suitable setup is identified within the kill zone, no trade should be taken, and the trader should wait for the next opportunity.
*   In the example, the market breaks lower and fills the order at 2:45 PM, resulting in approximately 40 pips of profit.
*   The speaker emphasizes the importance of structuring trades based on logical principles and the concepts taught.

**6. Addressing Skepticism and Emphasizing the Value of Hard Work**

*   The speaker acknowledges that some may disagree with the concepts or deny the existence of algorithms in the market.
*   He believes such skepticism often stems from a lack of personal success and a search for excuses.
*   He wishes for everyone to succeed and emphasizes the importance of consistent effort.
*   Success requires thorough chart analysis and passionate engagement with the material.
*   The teachings presented are considered advanced, typically reserved for charter members.
*   The concepts are applicable to various markets, including forex, bonds, and gold.

**7. Addressing Gold Trading**

*   Gold is characterized as an **event-driven market**, often requiring geopolitical events to trigger significant moves.
*   It is susceptible to manipulation, stop hunts, and consolidation, which can be frustrating for traders.
*   The speaker doesn't recommend aggressive short-term trading in gold, especially for beginners.
*   He acknowledges that some traders are consistently profitable in gold but advises new traders to focus on markets with better consistency.
*   He aims to make the information palatable for new viewers while also providing valuable insights for experienced traders.
*   The speaker emphasizes the presence of repeatable patterns and signatures in the market.
*   The final question posed is what the viewer intends to do with the information provided.


### Developing a Personalized Trading Approach Through Price Action Analysis

**1. Avoiding Reliance on Simplistic Indicators**

*   Are you simply going to say, "Okay, this is great, but this is too much work?"
*   Will you look for something else that gives you a moving average crossover or some kind of "bell and whistle" to put things on your chart to tell you what to do?
*   This approach can lead to creating a **"religious trading style"** because you're trusting something other than price.
*   The speaker emphasizes focusing solely on **price action**, without indicators.
*   Rectangles are used to highlight imbalances but aren't intended to remain permanently on the chart.
*   The goal is to eventually trade without these visual aids.

**2. The Importance of Chart Annotation and Study Journals**

*   In the beginning, while learning, it's important to **annotate your chart**.
*   Log annotations in a **study journal**.
*   At the end of the week, review all intraday price action.
*   Analyze how the weekly chart worked within the panoramic view of intraday and daily price action.
*   Understand how it all fits together.
*   By doing this, you're literally getting snapshots of:
    *   Every individual day.
    *   The daily chart.
    *   The weekly chart.
*   Analyze how it fulfilled its entire weekly range.
*   Note when the high and low were formed.
*   Identify the biggest day of the week.
*   Understand the framework around that biggest day of movement.
*   Breakdown trade setups.

**3. Learning from Hindsight and Avoiding Discouragement**

*   It doesn't matter if you didn't trade it.
*   Everything anyone ever learns is always done by **hindsight**.
*   Consider the medical profession: Doctors and surgeons study medical journals about events that took place when they were not present.
*   Don't let others discourage you from studying the market.
*   Follow the presented methods daily to improve.
*   Develop your own style of keeping notes in your charts.
*   The speaker avoids providing specific examples to prevent viewers from feeling obligated to replicate his exact approach.

**4. Developing Independent Analytical Skills**

*   It's fascinating to see people trained by the speaker mirroring his language and expressions in their own content.
*   The speaker leaves a portion of his charts empty, even in private groups, to encourage independent observation.
*   Use this space to write down observations about things you may want to further investigate.
*   These may be topics not covered in the current discussion or lecture.
*   Revisit the chart at the end of the week (Saturday or Sunday).
*   Walk through the entire week of how price delivered.
*   Note how many pips it moved and how much risk would have been incurred in the trade.

**5. Building a Foundation of Trust Through Backtesting**

*   All these factors contribute to a model that you'll grow accustomed to trusting.
*   This trust comes from having back data and examples that you've trained yourself to see over time.
*   By doing this, your psychological makeup as a trader will be formed with these things in mind.

**6. Recognizing Repeating Patterns in Price Action**

*   When you're watching price action, it will leap off the chart when it's forming.
*   You'll remember something you saw hundreds or thousands of times before that generally repeats over and over.
*   Does every single day look exactly like this? No.
*   However, there's a lot of similarity to the presented concepts that repeat.

**7. Understanding Market Signatures**

*   It's a matter of knowing what you're looking for.
*   Analogy: If two bears are walking in the snow, one younger and one older, will both footprints look exactly the same? No.
*   But you'll recognize they're both bear prints.
*   You'll also recognize which one's larger/older and which one's younger.
*   This is similar to recognizing signatures in price action.
*   They are generally very close to one another in terms of repeating the same type of way.
*   They're not going to be so identical that they're indistinguishable to the next one.
*   You'll be able to see that that's a different day of trading.
*   But you'll still recognize these repeating phenomena that are so telling in the marketplace.
*   You can't fully appreciate it right now because you're only now just becoming introduced to it.
*   Maybe you've watched some or all of the speaker's videos and it resonates with you.

**8. Overcoming Initial Challenges in Chart Analysis**

*   You may feel like your chart isn't as organized or it's not so obvious to you what you're looking for.
*   That's normal; the speaker experienced the same struggles in the 90s.
*   He struggled and floundered trying to figure out what he was supposed to be looking for.

**9. Creating Your Own Technical Analysis Resource**

*   The speaker is teaching you the things that repeat.
*   Your job is to keep going into the chart, annotating them, and keeping a running log/study journal of what the price action has done and what you're observing.
*   You can't get hurt because it's already happened; the moves have already happened, so you're studying them.
*   What you're creating is the greatest technical analysis book that you're ever going to own.
*   You're doing it in your own words with your own work.
*   When you buy a book, you're getting snapshots of something.
*   They're saying, "This is the important thing about this particular chapter or the theme of this particular book."
*   The speaker is showing you how you need to stop buying books.
*   In his opinion, no other books are necessary in trading, except for the ones he put in that one video in his library.
*   It's the same garbage that's repeated and rehashed, and people are just trying to do a cash grab.
*   You're not going to learn anything except for bad habits and flawed logic.

**10. Developing Expertise Through Consistent Effort**

*   When you've created a study journal with thousands of examples and you've been doing it for years, you're going to be astonished at how much of a technical analyst you are years from now.
*   You'll be able to see a lot more setups that you just don't see now.
*   There are several opportunities in this time frame/fractal here on a five-minute chart.
*   There are lots of little trades in here.
*   The speaker isn't going to go through and pick them all out because this is going to create a thousand different questions.
*   You're going to miss or overlook the very thing the speaker has shown you in this lecture.

**11. Applying the Model Across Markets and Timeframes**

*   This is a model that obviously works in this time frame in this pair.
*   It's in Forex.
*   It's not highly specific only to futures.
*   It's pretty clear, isn't it?
*   It may not have been clear before the speaker walked through it with you.
*   Hopefully, you learned a great deal of things tonight.
*   You learned a little bit about order blocks.
*   What makes an order block based on the fair value gap.
*   How do you differentiate how you look at the order block?
*   How do you break it down?
*   How do you invalidate the certain parts of the order block?
*   How do you know it's not going to go in the upper half of the order block or the last up closed candle before it goes down?
*   The speaker taught that tonight.
*   Hopefully, this has been insightful to you.

Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, adhering to all specified requirements:

# **Video Commentary: Blending Communities & Market Analysis**

## **Introduction & Context**

*   **Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEa1N0rTtbc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEa1N0rTtbc)
*   Welcome back! This video will blend content for both the private mentorship group and the YouTube community.
*   A midweek review, commentary, and teaching is usually done for the private mentorship group on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
*   YouTube gets a video on Tuesday and Thursday nights.
*   This video format is not the norm.

### **Holiday & Time Constraints**

*   Just got back from holiday in Florida where did some gum shoe detective work and found some interesting things, which will be brought up in coming weeks.
*   Returned late due to traffic delays.
*   Had many admin tasks related to mentorship and business.
*   Blending groups to save time.

## **Content Overview**

*   The video will cover what was promised for the YouTube commentary on Tuesday night (which was missed).
*   Commentary for the private mentorship group is also included.
*   The aim is to provide the YouTube audience a taste of the depth of teaching in the private group.
*   Discussion around the differences between the private group and the Youtube community.

### **Private Mentorship Group Advantages**

*   Sees analysis *before* it happens.
*   Learns moves and analysis *before* they occur.
*   A preview of what was shared on Monday night will be presented, leading into the promised YouTube teaching.

## **Live Streams & Teaching Style**

*   I am going to be doing live streams.
*   This is an outline of what will be happening in real time with intraday charts.
*   Live streams will be quicker.
*   Live streams will probably be me droning on about things while price action is moving.
*   I will be sharing insights and things that will seem irrelevant to some.
*   I will also cover entry patterns and targeting techniques.
*   "That's not all you need."
*   When the live stream portion begins, it will be clearly indicated.

## **Private Mentorship Group: Important Server Announcement**

*   **Important:** For private group members - download *all* videos.
*   Starting **June 1st, 2022**, the video server will no longer be hosted.
*   Moving away from videos to forum posts only.
*   Everything previously communicated via audio/video commentary will be typed out on charts.
*   This allows the group to know exactly what is being referred to, what it means, and what it's useful for.
*   And also where it's going to go before it's going to go.
*   This simplifies and expedites the process for everyone.
*   Helps to reduce the running costs of the community.

## **Distinction Between Private Mentorship & YouTube Content**

*   The private mentorship is no longer a paid service; there are no new members.
*   **Private Group:** See analysis *before* it happens and can incorporate the things that they learned.
*   **YouTube:** A bread-and-butter approach is given with a simplified model, stripped down.
*   Private mentorship group can strip down or make as intricate and complex as they want.
*   Private mentorship is for the freaks that just want to know everything.
*   The YouTube model provides easy rules that can lead to consistent success (as an analyst).

### **Promises & Outcomes**

*   The promise is to teach members to read the markets better than anyone else can show them.
*   This is provable weekly.
*   YouTube community members are seeing the results of focusing on specific things during specific times.
*   The teaching focuses on a very specific thing during a specific time of day.
*   Over time, patterns will emerge.

### **Fair Value Gaps & Market Signatures**

*   The market creates a fair value gap.
*   It breaks a low.
*   Comes back up and fills in the gap (partially or completely).
*   Precise accuracy is not needed; sound money management is key.

## **Closing Remarks**

*   "Now you know the real story."
*   I am not getting shut down.
*   I am not going to stop teaching.
*   Now I'm going to do more YouTube, just to get under the skin of those that just don't like it.

## **Dollar Index Analysis**

### **Daily Chart Analysis (For Private Group)**

*   Previously (on Monday night), the group looked for a bullish dollar.
*   Had been bullish on the dollar for a while now.
*   Targeted the 100 level (hit).
*   Targeted 101 (hit).
*   Anticipated a pullback after hitting 101.
*   Next target was 101.947.
*   The one after that was just short of 103 but rounded to 103.
*   Not calling a top in the dollar.
*   Sticking with the narrative that the dollar should keep being pressed higher.
*   This is considered a retracement after hitting another premium level.
*   A break below the recent lows would signal a potential turn or intermediate-term high.
*   It would take time to change the long-term bullish stance on the dollar.
*   Allowing for sloppy price action (as mentioned on Monday night).
*   Not in a hurry to take live trades yet due to the Passover holiday and associated volume lull.
*   Expect cleaner price action next week.
*   Looking for higher prices on the dollar until proven wrong.

### **Hourly Chart Analysis**

*   Move up to the 101 level left a clean formation.
*   Price does not like to leave those types of formations.
*   The body's respecting that level is algorithmic price action.
*   Algorithmic Price Action is delivered by an algorithm.
*   Not buying and selling pressure.
*   Not supply and demand.
*   Not harmonic.
*   Speculators have an opportunity to participate.
*   Markets book print and deliver on the basis of its algorithm.
*   Either you understand it or get run over.
*   If you're winning and I don't care what it is, the only time my trades were profitable is when I was in line with what the algorithm would do anyway.

### **Signature Patterns & Fractal Nature**

*   With the dollar index showing even the signatures that have been shown in the youtube community does this low being broken here in that very gap hits it right there we have another higher variable you got so what does that mean it could trade up into that but we're looking for the entry in here and then look at that
*   The same fractal nature of the pattern taught on YouTube exists here.
*   50% of parent price swing is an algorithmic level.
*   A break in structure with a fair value gap is shown.
*   The volume of the move is inside the bodies of the candle
*   Look for an underlying narrative.
*   It's likely to go back in here and fill this one single candle that created that imbalance, the candle's low, this candle's high, that small little imbalance right in here it goes up and fills in that spends some time there then breaks aggressively attacking all the stops below here here here fills in the gap and then goes right below that low why because equilibrium exists between this low and this high why did it drop like this because it hit our second target of 101 and plus it's 100 points or pips above the full 100 level
*   Not convinced the dollar has topped.
*   Highs could be the top but always the chance to be wrong.
*   Not trying to pick tops and bottoms.
*   This is where I can be wrong.

### **Application Across Markets**

*   *Important:* The principles taught are applicable to forex, bonds, and futures.
*   I cut my teeth on all that stuff in the 90's.
*   I am not a crypto trader and would blow my accounts.
*   I am good at Forex and futures, that's it.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, adhering to all specified requirements:

## **Institutional Order Flow & Market Bias**

### **Higher Time Frame Bias & Dollar Analysis**

*   Does what I teach make you feel inferior? Does it make you feel like you don't know what you're doing? If so, that's good because it keeps you on the right side of **institutional order flow**.
*   Institutional order flow is rooted on higher time frame bias.
*   The dollar is bullish, at least in my opinion.
*   While I don't subscribe to the idea that we have topped here, I like the idea that we came back down into this run.
*   For those looking for resistance ideas, a break in market structure, and a break and re-test, it’s not that simple.
*   Calling tops and bottoms in the marketplace is what I'm specifically honing in on.
*   I think we're going to revisit that **101 level** and we have unfinished business above it. That means it's likely to go a little bit higher than that.
*   I'm not convinced at all that we've changed gears.

### **The Importance of Listening & Understanding**

*   Some of you didn't listen to me when I said it the first or second time.
*   You have selective hearing.
*   You're waiting for the words "**order block**," "**fair value gap**," or "**break in market structure**."
*   You came into this video with preconceived notions or expectations that I'm going to somehow qualify your analysis that you think is going to happen in Forex.
*   When I say these buzzwords, your ears perk up, and you'll be real attentive.
*   Then you're going to do something in the marketplace based on that and not even listen to anything else in this video because I'm talking too much (that's going to be the excuse), but you're not listening.
*   You have to listen and understand what I'm teaching you.
*   **Do not try to pick tops and bottoms.** You don't need that.
*   There's a lot of opportunity between intermediate term highs and lows.

### **Dollar Correlation & Trade Sentiment**

*   I don't mind missing the long-term high in a long-term low. I don't need that.
*   I can be wrong in trades trying to be bullish on the dollar.
*   I don't trade the dollar, but if I'm bullish on the dollar, that means essentially I'm bearish on the Euro and British Pound versus the US dollar.
*   All foreign currencies that I’m bearish on are bullish on dollar.
*   Don't take what I'm saying here in one sentence or one little notation that I make reference to in a specific chart and make a sentiment idea or a justification for your trade.

## **15-Minute Timeframe & Market Manipulation**

### **Liquidity & Resistance Levels**

*   On the 15-minute timeframe, we finally made it south side.
*   Liquidity is resting below these lows in here (swing low), and we had sell-side resting below here as well.
*   They're really building the idea that this is resistance.
*   We might want to go a little bit deeper if it retrades back.
*   We could trade back to the **100 level**, maybe sneak below just a little bit to make everybody think this is really done.
*   If I was making the market for the dollar, I would take it down below 100, dip it into 99.95 or 92 in that area, and then start to work it higher.
*   That's how I would do it because it would convince everybody out there that the dollar is probably topped, and then I would take it in the other direction.

### **Personal Trading Experiences**

*   You know what I'm talking about. It happens most of the time in your trades.
*   You get in and you take something, and all of a sudden, it's not as bullish as you thought it was, and it went lower.
*   I've been there.
*   I'm not making fun of you.

## **Order Block Theory**

### **Hourly Fair Value Gap & Bearish Order Block**

*   Here is that hourly fair value gap, but now look at it with the lens of the 15-minute time frame.
*   We have this area here, but then we have this imbalance right there.
*   It comes up a little bit deeper, closes that in.
*   What do these two up close candles represent? A **bearish order block**.
*   We can use the low of the lowest up close candle and its opening price. You draw that out in time, and it hammered it.
*   Why is this an order block? Well, it's because it's where price was delivered on the upside, even though it's indecisive candles here, that up close right before this displacement to the downside.
*   It's not what these folks are taking from my videos and writing books on Amazon. Completely wrong.
*   There's a lot of things I'm going to keep from even my private mentorship group about order block theory until my books are released.

### **Book Release & Order Block Secrets**

*   I've purposely held that back. Why is he holding back everything?
*   It's because I have four books coming: one's fiction, and three are technical.
*   I'm gonna put things out there because there's a lot of people out there who have falsely stated that they created this or I copied it from something, and you don't know anything about order blocks.
*   Trust me, you don't know anything about it, but you know enough to find something that repeats over and over again.
*   In the second book in my trilogy, I'm writing (when is it coming out? You'll know more about that as I come), I'm gonna divulge a lot about order blocks.
*   The whole pandemic thing messed up the delivery schedule I had for him.
*   The second volume in that trilogy is when I’m going to divulge a lot about order blocks.
*   That way, the world, the community, and trading will know it's mine, and you'll know more about it there.
*   Anything that happens after the fact, I'm going to correct a lot of people that think they need to talk about blocks because they're actually harming people that pay them or listen to them, and it's not true.

### **Algorithm Bookmarks & Stop Loss Logic**

*   Really what they're saying is the stuff that goes along with supply and demand, and I'm not supplying demand.
*   Why are these candles here on the order block?
*   It's because we had the change in the state of delivery where it's already dropping then it goes higher.
*   The algorithm is putting a bookmark. This is where it will want to refer back to in the future.
*   Think of it like that.
*   Let's say you're reading a book, and you're in this chapter, and all of a sudden, real life kicks in.
*   You got to go back to work, or you can't read anymore because your spouse says you need to do some things around the house.
*   You have to stop reading, you put your little bookmark in the page where you're at, and then you come back to it later on.
*   When you stop reading, that's essentially where this candle closes, and then all this happens while you're away from the book, and then when you come back to the book here, you pick up with the storyline, and what was the story line? It was dropping.
*   It just had a little pause in here, and then we go right back to the storyline.
*   Maybe that analogy doesn't fit you, but it makes sense in a lot of ways to me.
*   It's like a reference point that the algorithm will go back to because the algorithm doesn't know where your specific stop is at all times.
*   Your broker does, but the algorithm doesn't necessarily know where your stop is or my stop is at any given time.
*   It's based on the logic that is really promoted and regurgitated all the time in books and seminars and course teachers and things: put your stop right above the high.
*   It's always the same thing all the time.
*   It doesn't take a rocket scientist to sit down on the chart and say, "Yeah, well, if it's been dropping, find a short-term high most recently, and right above that, there's going to be buy stops for anyone that's short. They've trailed their stop-loss down."

### **Trailing Stop-Loss Mentality**

*   It's like anyone that went short up here and was fortunate to be right, and it does this move here, starts to break down, their stop would be moved from here to right above this short-term high, that trailing stop loss mentality.
*   I'm not a real big fan of rushing my stop, and that's why I teach the way I teach, because I'm looking for things that make sense, and I'm not trying to strangle the marketplace.
*   This order block here is a change in the state of delivery. It's been going lower. It's likely to go lower.
*   This displacement qualifies that order block because it creates a fair value, and the narrative is likely to go lower.
*   This lower movement is short term in nature; it's counter long-term bias.

## **Trading Style & Skill Set**

### **Dangers of Counter-Trend Trading**

*   You can and will absolutely lose money trading this style of trading because you're going against the higher time frame order flow.
*   This type of trading, if you go in and you're trying to be very nimble, trying to go in and think you can swing up and down, buy sell buy sell, and you just recently started, you're going to absolutely blow your account.
*   That is exactly what's going to happen, so don't do this.
*   Why am I teaching this? So that way, you don't do it.

### **Understanding Retracements & Developing Skills**

*   Understand that this is all part of a natural retracement, and you can trust and study and back test all the things that I've been teaching you, and they exist even in these moves here.
*   You may not, and don't be offended by this, you may not have the skill set to see this type of retracement lower and short it.
*   That's okay. You don't need to have that skill set.
*   I have students that are really good with trading contrary in setups like this that don't trust bias because they think the moment they get in, it's going to turn on them, so they like to take contrary in trades where they trust it more because it just makes sense for it to be broken.
*   In other words, they know that this possibly makes heat going higher because they hear me saying it, but that doesn't change their convictions about being a contrarian, and in some ways, they're going against what I'm saying is a higher time frame overflow bias.
*   They know how to pick these opportunities where there is confirmation is not likely to continue at that very moment, so therefore, they'll go in and go against that bias and take trades.

### **Matching Trading Style to Personality**

*   Is that wrong? No, because it matches their personality, and they know where those opportunities exist.
*   Do I think that all new students should go in with that expectation and that mode of study? Absolutely not. No way. Absolutely no way.
*   If that's what you really are internally as a trader, it'll materialize and manifest itself over time.
*   The only way you're going to know that is by learning the way I'm teaching it because I'm teaching you how to trust the higher time frame bias.
*   I'm not teaching "the trend is your friend" because the things that they're using to promote those ideas, I don't subscribe to.
*   Since I don't subscribe to those views, I don't look at it that way.
*   I'm looking at how the market moves from discount to premium, premium to discount, and also within market structure.

### **Recognizing Patterns & Criteria**

*   Some of you at times will point and say it looks like this or it looks like that over here.
*   It's only momentary familiarity.
*   It looks familiar, but it's not.
*   There's a whole lot of other things going on that just sometimes look very similar to certain things, but there's a specific criteria that takes place that I'm looking for that I teach my students.
*   You've learned a very simple approach to that that's existing right here in this chart in the YouTube model.

## **YouTube Community & Market Analysis**

### **Euro Analysis & Bias Confirmation**

*   You're on a dollar daily chart.
*   It's been a while since I've talked to the YouTube community (like two weeks or so).
*   I drew your attention to that low. I said we were aiming for that, and as luck would have it, look, it went down there.
*   That is an example of bias.
*   That is an example of what I've actually talked to my community about for weeks as it was starting to come down.
*   We were up here looking forward to coming down to that low.
*   I mentioned this low here. I mentioned these lows here, and this low there, and you all on YouTube knew that we were looking for this run on Euro.

### **Personal Reflections & Market Integrity**

*   The problem, and this is why I'm not trading Forex at the moment.
*   No, Forex is not broken.
*   No, I don't think they're ever going to change the algorithm.
*   No, I don't think that they're going to change their algorithm or go against the things I'm teaching because the way I'm teaching is the market itself.
*   It's the internal engines that make these price deliveries appear on your chart.
*   That's why I'm teaching it, and with no real reservations because I know me teaching this isn't going to change anything.

### **Individual Responsibility & Market Realities**

*   The level of trades that are being pushed through these markets is not going to be changed by you watching these videos because honestly, I've taught for years, and there's a lot of people that just simply cannot follow instructions.
*   They can't follow rules, and they want to fault somebody else.
*   They want to fault this one over here. They want to fault me. They want to fault the concepts when there's people already out there proving just from the free stuff that they're passing competitions and challenges and making money in their own accounts.
*   You're doing very well in demo.
*   They all have a wide range of experiences already, and I've only started the last week or so in January.
*   This business is very personal, and it's going to reveal a lot of things about you, and you're going to see things that you didn't recognize before, and sometimes it's gonna be ugly.

### **Personal Growth & Overcoming Challenges**

*   You're not as good as you thought you were.
*   You're not as astute as you thought you were.
*   You're not as responsible as you thought you were.
*   Believe me, I learned those lessons in the 90s, and it was not fun.
*   You resist it, and the folks that resist it will never get it, and they'll never learn how to trade properly from anyone else because they have a deep-rooted issue within themselves.
*   It won't make a difference if somebody else steps in and says, "Hey, I got something that's going to do it for you. ICT complicates things. I'm going to give you this thing here. You push a button, and it gets you in."
*   No, the same underlying issues that are plaguing the individual will manifest in any trading approach because they lack responsibility number one, they lack the adherence to rules, and they have not put enough time in.
*   If you're not getting instant gratification, you're done.

### **Preparation for Trading Realities**

*   That's what the main critical thing about me is because I'm lecturing, I'm teaching you what you're going to encounter.
*   You may not feel this is applicable to you, but I guarantee you stay long enough in this, you're going to be met with this.
*   If I don't tell you how to deal with it or overcome it or think about how you should be overcoming it when you get to that bridge, because you're all going to get to it eventually.
*   Different times, different people, everyone grows differently, but you're going to have these crossroads where you come to where you feel like, "You know, I don't think I should be doing this anymore. I think I should be doing that, or the grass looks greener on that over here, or this person made money over here, and I haven't made money this week, so maybe my stuff's broken. Let me go and look at this."

### **Sound Money Management & Trading Success**

*   That's nonsense.
*   There's people out there that don't trade like me, and they make millions because they are good money managers, period.
*   That's it.
*   They have something that gives them a decision-making process.
*   They call it their system or their edge, but really they're just good money managers, period.
*   They have something that instigates the idea of a transaction in the marketplace.
*   They have a faith-based system in believing that as long as it doesn't do this, go down to a level where they would put a stop, they'll stay with that idea, and then when it gets to another level, they get out.
*   That's trading.
*   The idea is I don't think that profitable systems outside of what I'm teaching are linked to their actual system.
*   It's linked to their adherence to their rules, sound money management, and not over trading and not over leveraging.
*   Literally, I could flip a quarter, and you could too, with sound money management.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, adhering to all specified requirements:

## **Mounting Management & Trading Strategies**

### **Flipping a Quarter: A Simple Trading Exercise**

*   With **mounting management**, you could potentially make an account profitable.
*   This may sound unorthodox.
*   **Suggestion:** Conduct a demo account exercise by flipping a quarter.
    *   If it's heads, buy.
    *   If it's tails, sell short.
    *   Execute this strategy every single day.
    *   Risk no more than a half percent.
    *   Aim for one percent profit.
    *   Buy at the open and sell at the open – that's the entire strategy.
    *   Use a 30 pip stop loss and trade a forex pair.
*   **Objective:** Test the difficulty of blowing the account.
    *   It requires significant effort to deplete the account using this method.
    *   Over time, the exercise can demonstrate potential profitability.

### **Refining Trading Strategies: Limiting Trades & Defining Parameters**

*   Apply the following refinements to your trading approach:
    *   **Limit the number of trades.**
    *   **Reduce the frequency of trading per week:**
        *   Designate specific trading days.
        *   Define specific trading times within those days.
    *   **Narrow down asset classes:**
        *   Choose specific markets within an asset class.
        *   Determine your directional bias (bullish or bearish) for that market.
*   **Concept:** Refine your trading down to an algorithm or recipe.
    *   A recipe is an algorithm:
        *   It involves a list of ingredients.
        *   Ingredients are combined in a specific order.
        *   The expected outcome is a cake, cookie, or desired product.
*   **Key takeaway:** Recipes (strategies) are provided, and it's up to the individual to decide how to utilize them.

### **Guidance & Personalized Trading Styles**

*   The presenter demonstrates market analysis every week in their mentorship group, indicating potential market movements beforehand.
*   Guidance is provided on where the market is likely to move, based on previously taught entry strategies.
*   The goal is not to force a specific entry strategy on any student, as imposing a universal approach guarantees failure both for the mentor and the students.
*   There is a recognition that there is a wide disparity between personality types between individuals.
*   The teaching style is designed to allow students to find their own trading style using the provided tools and concepts.
*   While the presenter can trade using every strategy and better students can utilize a good selection of them, no student can flawlessly execute every strategy.
*   There are consistently profitable traders but also those who struggle.
*   For those in the YouTube community who express difficulty, the following encouragement is given:
    *   Do not gang up on or make fun of them.
    *   Offer encouragement.
    *   Recognize that their posts indicate frustration and a potential desire to quit unless someone intervenes.
*   The presenter hopes that publicly showing and discussing potential market movements will demonstrate the possibility of forecasting price action.
*   **Action Step:** Analyze past moves and decipher the presenter's indicators to identify useful setups.
*   Determine if these setups repeat frequently enough to justify a specific trading approach.

### **Adapting Trading Styles to Life Constraints**

*   Some students cannot day trade due to other commitments (businesses, school, jobs).
*   These individuals may need to position trade, utilizing daily or four-hour charts.
*   While this approach requires patience due to the longer timeframes, it is a viable option.
*   The presenter mentioned in previous videos that the community was aiming for a specific low which was met.

### **Currency Market Conditions & Alternative Opportunities**

*   The presenter is currently not trading Forex due to the current "muddy" market conditions.
*   Currency movement is hindered by:
    *   Trade disruptions
    *   Supply chain congestion
*   Many experienced and consistently profitable traders are not actively discussing currencies due to the asset class being currently quiet or "asleep".
*   The presenter believes this is temporary and that currencies will become active again in the future.
*   The current slow market makes it difficult for new traders to learn, as they desire excitement and animation in price action.
*   The presenter navigates the marketplace by focusing on asset classes with significant movement and excitement. Currently, Forex isn't it.
*   Index futures have been an area of focus and are expected to be strong.
*   May can be bearish and the presenter is looking for evidence that supports this.
*   Euro dollar delivered the lower prices as expected.
*   The same principles used in the live streams apply to intraday charts.

## **Live Streams & Intraday Analysis**

### **Draw on Liquidity: Understanding Price Targets**

*   The presenter will outline the anticipated draw on liquidity during live streams.
*   The draw on liquidity was below a specific low.
*   Each day, price moved lower, breaking through previous lows before retracing.
*   The presenters plans to indicate where they anticipate intraday price action to move to.
*   It is critical that audience members don't trade based on those suggestions alone.

### **Tape Reading & Market Consistency**

*   The intention of pointing to the movement of intraday price action is to force you to study price action.
*   **Tape reading** is essential for consistent trading.
*   Profits made without tape reading are often based on circumstance rather than market understanding.
*   Past periods of profitability may have been due to luck, such as buying into a perpetual bull market where everything was increasing in value.

### **Live Streams in May: Futures Focus & Community Learning**

*   Live streams in May will primarily focus on futures, but sometimes Forex will be covered.
*   The presenter wants to demonstrate their knowledge of futures markets, as they have been trading them since 1992.

### **Addressing Common Concerns & The Algorithm**

*   The presenter addresses questions such as:
    *   What if you're wrong?
    *   What if teaching these concepts changes the algorithm?
    *   Will the algorithm target those using these strategies?
*   Even if the presenter's strategies become obsolete, the presenter would revert to trading futures.
*   Therefore, avoid favoring one asset class over another; all asset classes rotate between hot and cold periods.
*   The experience of navigating these asset class rotations is valuable and developed over many years.
*   The goal is to equip individuals with the knowledge to overcome impediments to success.

### **Market Realities & Avoiding Frustration**

*   Just because you think you see something in the market does not guarantee that it will happen.
*   Consolidation can be frustrating for traders expecting a specific movement.
*   Attempts to break out and go short below a low can result in quick reversals.
*   The presenter teaches that liquidity below a low is the ultimate target.
*   Up close candles can present opportunities to go short and drive the price lower.

### **Video Structure & Content Overview**

*   The video is longer and more conversational than usual to address both the private and public communities.
*   The presenter acknowledges that the video style may be irritating to some viewers.
*   However, the presenter believes there is valuable content within the video and encourages viewers to filter out what is not useful to them.

## **Euro Analysis & Contrarian Trading**

### **Hourly Chart Analysis & Key Levels**

*   The presenter analyzes the hourly chart of the Euro, referencing a specific daily low at **1.0806**.
*   The market broke down below this level, rallied, created a fair value gap, and ran back up to old highs.
*   An **optimal trade entry** occurred from the high to the low, entering a short-term premium.

### **Contrarian Trading: Capitalizing on Retail Sentiment**

*   Referencing the earlier discussion about the dollar index, the presenter describes how some students use a contrarian approach.
*   When the presenter is long-term bullish on the dollar, these students identify points where retail traders anticipate a top and then capitalize on those setups.
*   This looks like the following on the Euro:
    *   A run back down into old support on the daily low.
    *   Rallies create a fair value gap.
    *   Buying in this fair value gap and trading above the bodies of previous candles towards the 62% retracement level.
*   This allows for short-term gains against the prevailing trend.
*   A contrarian trade against the presenter's suggested bias (bearish on Euro until the specified low) involved capitalizing on perceived reversals.
*   For the YouTube community, it's important to note that the presenter currently has no specific level to target for a reversal on the Euro.
*   The market is currently in a sideways consolidation area.
*   We must wait for displacement.
*   The upside would be great as it would give something to work with.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, adhering to all specified requirements:

## **Euro Analysis & Market Conditions**

### **Euro Price Action Analysis: A Potential Range**

*   If the price breaks lower, it will provide a clearer range to work with.
*   **Range Definition:** From a specific high to a specific low.
    *   The price went below previous lows.
    *   A short-term break in market structure occurred.
    *   This low was broken, and the price returned to fill a **fair value gap**.
    *   Price spent considerable time in this area.
    *   Following a holiday and the start of a new week, volume was slow.
    *   A small price movement occurred, returning to the range's high.
*   **Premium Zone:** Above 50% of the range (high to low).
    *   The **62% to 79% retracement level** is the target.
*   **Anticipated Move:** If displacement occurs lower, expect a repeated pattern. The vice versa is also true for higher movements.
*   **Objective Achieved:** The presenter wanted the Euro to go below a specific low on the daily chart.
    *   Since this occurred, a near-term neutral stance is taken on the dollar.
    *   Long-term outlook on the dollar remains bullish.
    *   Currently, there is no discernible setup.

### **Addressing New Traders: No Trade Opportunity Now**

*   The presenter acknowledges that it may sound unusual that, after 30 years of experience, no trade opportunity is apparent on the daily, four-hour, or hourly charts *at the time of recording*.
*   **Reasoning:** The presenter cannot identify a valid trade setup based on the current chart formations.
*   **Transparency:** The presenter is providing a contrasting view compared to what the private community receives.
*   Neither community should be envious or feel animosity, as opportunities to join the private group are closed.

### **Euro/Dollar 15-Minute Time Frame: Fair Value Gap**

*   The 15-minute chart shows a "clean" **fair value gap**, which was previously referenced on the hourly chart.
*   **Clean Definition:**
    *   A strong upward movement.
    *   Price returns to the old daily low.
    *   Algorithmic displacement: a strong, energetic move higher.
    *   The gap creation is significant, regardless of further upward movement.
*   **New Trader Perspective:**
    *   Waiting for the price to return to this level may seem impossible for impatient or inexperienced traders.
    *   They may fear the price will break below equal lows.
    *   The narrative from YouTube may suggest otherwise.
*   **Current Market Conditions:**
    *   Short-term oversold conditions on the daily chart.
    *   Previous sell stops and sell-side liquidity have been taken out.
    *   The market will now seek buy-side liquidity, requiring upward movement.
*   **Trade Opportunity:**
    *   Energetic move from the daily low creates displacement.
    *   On a pullback, the presenter considers:
        *   Price will run back up to the short-term high.
        *   Even if it doesn't reach that high, movement above the bodies of recent candles toward the **62% retracement level** (on the hourly chart) is favorable.
    *   This would provide an opportunity to buy and then sell the long position for approximately 30 pips, described as a "bread and butter" trade.
*   **Recommendation:** This type of trade is *not* recommended for new traders as it goes against the order flow.
    *   It is suitable for backtesting.

### **Backtesting & Long-Term Perspective**

*   Over months and years of backtesting, patterns can be identified.
*   **Counter Arguments:** Excuses that concepts don't work, because of lack of effort.
*   New traders often expect immediate results from a single video's setup.
*   Bias and daily candle expectations may be incorrect, leading to errors.
*   Rushing leads to mistakes, and there is no guaranteed "right away" in trading, except for potentially blowing the account.
*   The presenter aims to prepare traders for potential pitfalls.
*   A mental perspective on market alignment with trader expectations takes time.
*   This alignment doesn't happen quickly through a single video or within a short timeframe.
*   New traders likely don't know what they want to do or what their trading model will evolve into.

### **Trading as a Business & Continuous Learning**

*   Trading should be treated as a business, requiring constant attention.
*   All trades, profitable or not, are learning experiences.
*   Backtesting and trade journaling are essential.
*   Annotate charts and refer back to daily chart performance.

## **British Pound Analysis**

### **Pound/Dollar Analysis: Consolidation & Bearish Bias**

*   A fair value gap was present, followed by a rally.
*   The presenter mentioned the anticipation of going below a specific low, which occurred.
*   As mentioned on Monday, a consolidation-type, sloppy price action environment is expected, still within the holiday doldrums.
*   Much money was on the sidelines last week.
*   Waiting for smart money to initiate movement to gain a clearer bias.
*   The presenter maintains a bearish stance on the British pound versus the U.S. dollar.
    *   Due to a long-term bullish stance on the dollar.
    *   The presenter believes other currencies (Euro, Aussie, etc.) will eventually decline.
*   If the price trades *above* the fair value gap, the bearish stance is incorrect.
*   As long as the price remains *below* the fair value gap, the presenter is bearish on cable (pound versus dollar nickname).

### **Hourly & 15-Minute Charts: Lack of Trade Setups**

*   **Hourly Chart:** There is "absolutely zero" noteworthy or tradable on this chart.
    *   No discernible setup.
*   **15-Minute Chart:** Sloppy and without clear signals.
*   **Contrast:** Unlike the "clean" Euro price action, the Pound lacks defined patterns.

### **Actionable Advice: When to Step Away**

*   If a market appears messy, consider:
    *   Closing the charts.
    *   Turning off the computer.
    *   Engaging in enjoyable activities (hobbies, family, friends).
    *   Having an outlet outside of the markets is essential to avoid burnout.
*   **Key takeaway:** *Don't touch* messy markets.

### **Presenter's Experience: Avoiding the Pound**

*   The presenter has avoided trading the British pound for months due to unfavorable conditions.
*   **Misconceptions:** This isn't due to algorithm changes, but current market realities.
*   Global trade disruptions are affecting currencies.
*   Patience is required until market conditions improve.
*   Eventually, these markets will become more active, creating "salad days" (easy trading).

### **Avoiding Frustration & Impulsive Trading**

*   Don't be discouraged by the current market; it teaches when *not* to trade.
*   It's crucial to know *why* and *when not* to do something.
*   This prevents account depletion, undisciplined actions, and removes the fear of missing out.
*   The presenter feels no FOMO about the current Pound price action.
*   If a market performs poorly, leave it alone.
*   **Key message:** You *do not* need to trade every day.

### **Understanding Probable Outcomes**

*   Understand why a particular day is highly probable to deliver your bias towards a known target.
*   Have an expectation of where the price will move next (higher or lower).
*   Without this, trading becomes gambling.
*   The impulse to trade daily is a gambler's mentality.
*   The presenter does not promote gambling, over-leveraging, or relying on luck.

### **Responsible Trading: A Path to Profitability**

*   Promote using one contract with the goal of doubling the account.
*   Work with the lowest leverage possible.

    *   If the methods are fraudulent, diligent effort will reveal it.
*   **Validation Through Work:**
    *   Those who have put in the work are convinced of the truth and consistency.
    *   Consistency doesn't mean the same setup appears daily in the same pair.

### **Market Conditions & Adjusting Strategies**

*   **Current Example:** None of the presenter’s teachings are currently evident in a specific pair.
    *   This pair has not been featured to the presenter's private group for a long time due to unclear price action.
*   **Adaptation:** When a market lacks clear signals, the presenter shifts attention elsewhere.
*   **Current Focus:** Index futures.
*   **Manipulation vs. Algorithm:**
    *   Just because a strategy isn't working *now* doesn't mean it's dead or the algorithm has stopped.
    *   It may indicate heavy manipulation.
*   **Actionable Advice: Avoiding "Rattlesnakes":**

    *   It's hard to stand still, especially after two weeks without a trade.

*   **The Trap of System Hopping:** Both reactions are wrong.
    *   30 years of experience has taught this lesson.
    *   Books discuss system hopping, but the lesson isn't truly learned until after blowing accounts.
*   **Flawed Logic:**
    *   Many trading styles and approaches lack sound logic.
    *   Diversions, indicators, harmonic patterns, etc., promote a religious view, not time and price.
*   **Focus on Time and Price:**
    *   Time and price are not a religion; they are the truth that markets deliver.
    *   Look at the chart: Time at the bottom, price on the vertical axis.

    *   Avoid adding unnecessary elements like triangles, shapes, moving averages, etc.
    *   Focus on what the candlesticks are documenting.
*   **Key Questions to Ask:**

*   **Personal Experience:** The presenter did the same thing and blew accounts repeatedly, crying and weeping.

    *   Analogy: Free glasses of water.
    *   If others drink and drop dead, don't have a swig.

    *   Lipstick on a pig is still a pig.

*   **Variation on a Theme:** This analysis is a variation on that idea and premise.
*   **Understanding Market Dynamics:**
    *   How the market created the low and the reaction on the specified dates.
    *   The presenter will include a clip from Monday's video to show the private group’s insights.
*   **Purpose of Sharing:**
    *   Not to boast or show off intelligence.
    *   To show that the analysis is rooted in sound logic, not chance or gambling.
*   **Daily Chart Implications:**
    *   Because the chart retraced to equilibrium/short-term discount, the daily bias is likely to be bullish.
*   **Mean Threshold:** Midpoint of the up close candle.
*   **Order Block:**
    *   Mean threshold is the median of an order block.
    *   The line on the chart represents this.

### **Bias & Expectation Management**

*   **Teaching Bias:** If you want to be taught about bias, listen to this section.
*   **Understanding Bias:**
    *   It went down to equilibrium/short-term discount, so expect it to go higher.
*   **Dealing with Uncertainty:**
    *   What if the next day is down or doesn't move? Expect it to go higher the *next* day.
*   **Realistic Expectations:**
    *   Don't expect perfect results every time.
    *   Sometimes your "cookies" (trades) won't turn out perfectly.
*   **Consistency Over Perfection:** Focus on logic. Outlining something that, *because* of logic, is one good setup to focus on as students.
*   **Premium Array:** The market is likely to draw up into that.
    *   Could be the candle's low, because it's the order block.
*   **Identifying Targets:**
    *   Concerned about the candle because, before the downside displacement, it was the last up close candle.
    *   Targets: Candle low, open, mean threshold (half the order block), and high.
    *   The high is the least likely target.
*   **Addressing Skepticism:**
    *   For those who criticize, the presenter is not picking arbitrary levels.
    *   Respond internally and ignore those distractions.
*   **The Power of Effort:** If you put in the work, you *will* see the results.
*   **Picking Easy Targets:** As a developing student, pick the easiest target.

### **Combining Concepts & Understanding Liquidity**

*   **Example Scenario:**
    *   Buying below the opening price.
    *   Profitability can be achieved by reaching just up into the candle's low.
    *   Draw that out in time to see where the targets would be hit.
*   **Multiple Targets:** Several targets for students: the low, the body, and the mean threshold.
*   **Blending Concepts:** Blending with the "Purge and Revert" idea.
*   **Purge and Revert Explained:**
    *   We went down and took out a short term low (sell-side liquidity).
    *   Purged sell stops and is going to revert back to the high in the last three days.
*   **Buy Stops:**
    *   Why buy stops would be resting above that high.
    *   Traders who are short will trail their stop loss there.
*   **Lower Time Frames:** More easily understood when dropping to lower time frames.
*   **Key Insight:**
    *   You *will* have to listen to this part of the video a few times.
    *   This is what nobody is teaching you, because they don't know it.
    *   This is what goes on.
    *   It's also why the presenter told the private group what took place.
*   **Hourly Chart Analysis:**
*   **E-Mini S&P June Contract:** The market traded down into the short-term low.
    *   Ran out sell stops/sell-side liquidity.
    *   Purged that liquidity.
    *   Then had sloppiness and then rallied up.
*   **Lack of Cleanliness:** Doesn't look too clean and clear in here.
*   **Lower Time Frame:** About to change we're going to drop down the lower time frame because we have a bias i mentioned on monday that i felt that this was going to go higher and clear up all this here and that was the draw on liquidity now here's that part of the video i said when we get into the discussion about live sessions what am i going to be doing basically what i'm going to show you a clip of when i get to the 15 minute time frame i'm going to show you the clip from monday night's private mentorship video where i discuss before it happened where the e-mini s p was likely to go why i felt it was likely to happen and i'm going to amplify that here so that way both communities can appreciate what it is that i'm going to be doing with intraday price action the guys over in goldman sachs and you've been with me for a while you know who i'm talking about uh they like to say that intraday is just noise and one of those guys actually said he tried very hard to make it work and if anybody tells you the injury trading is profitable and you

## Analysis of a London Session Forex Trade Setup

**Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6GFu8-Z4rY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6GFu8-Z4rY)

### Introduction

This analysis aims to demonstrate a specific price action pattern that the algorithm is likely to repeat, based on the logic shared on this YouTube channel.  The focus is on applying these concepts during the **London session** for Forex trading.  The presenter emphasizes this is not an addition to his core model, but rather an answer to viewer questions and a demonstration of existing principles. He is not interested in providing live session copy trading.

### Setting the Stage: Overnight Analysis and Dollar Index Prediction

The presenter references an analysis given the previous night, episode 19. At the 20-minute, 10-second mark (and for about a minute thereafter), he outlined his expectations for the Dollar Index (**DXY**).

*   **Prediction:**  He felt the DXY would drop *below* the **100 level**.
*   **Target:** He specifically called out the **99.92 level** as a target where a buying opportunity would likely present itself.
*   **Rationale:**  He states that this level was chosen as a point that a market maker (if he were one) would target to set up a buying opportunity.

### Addressing Skepticism

The presenter anticipates criticism from those who dismiss his approach and emphasizes the importance of independent investigation. He encourages viewers to verify his claims rather than blindly accepting alternative viewpoints.  He acknowledges that some viewers may be looking for "spoon-fed" setups and warns them that he will not provide that kind of direct trading advice. He emphasizes the need for independent learning and application of his concepts.

### Justification for the 99.92 Level Target

The presenter explains the rationale behind selecting the 99.92 level:

*   He looked at a price action run-up, specifically the beginning of a particular candle.
*   He used that candles high and then eyeballed from that point what he described as a small three pip range around 99.95 and 99.92.
*   He did not utilize his full arsenal of tools. He admits he has techniques to fine-tune the low of the day, sometimes within 2-3 pips but emphasized that it wasn't necessary for this example. These techniques were excluded, in part, because of his obligations to his private community.

### London Session Setup and Observations

The presenter highlights the key events during the London session:

*   **Initial Setup:** The market ran up above relative equal highs which it then ran for intraday targets.
*   **London Low:** It then dropped down creating the entire run lower creating the London low, very close to the outlined 99.92 target.
*   **Rally and High of Day:**  The market then rallied, initially taking out the earlier high of the day, then aiming for cleaner levels (previous highs).

He points out inefficiencies in market behavior, specifically how the market will take out easily accessible highs or lows (those that are appealing to retail technical analysis) before moving on to the next levels.

### Euro Correlation

The presenter emphasizes the inverse relationship between the DXY and the Euro (**EUR/USD**) and its importance.

*   As the **DXY** dropped to the 99.92 level (his predicted buying opportunity), **EUR/USD** rallied.
*   **EUR/USD** even went above the previous week's high creating a false breakout.
*   This confirmed his bearish bias on foreign currency, in general and Euro, in specific, setting the stage for a shorting opportunity.

He reiterates that he did not take the trade himself.

### Killzone and Order Block

Zooming in on the 15 minute time frame we can see:
* The London killzone which he teaches on the channel is between 2:00 AM and 5:00 AM NY Time.
* The market came down and created the low of day.
* The market ran up into an order block within that killzone.
* The market then swept equal relative highs, creating a daily objective.

### EUR/USD Entry Example (Two-Minute Chart)

The presenter dives into a two-minute chart of **EUR/USD** to illustrate a potential short entry.

*   **Fair Value Gap (FVG):** Identifies a key FVG level after the run above the weekly high.
*   **Shift in Market Structure:** The market trades lower, breaking a short-term low.
*   **Entry Point:**  After failing to reach the FVG on an initial retracement, the market moves lower and then rallies back to the FVG.
    *   He emphasizes the importance of the energetic displacement away from the FVG to confirm the setup.
* The stop loss would be right above the high.

### Hypothetical Trade Details

*   **Entry (Limit Order):** 1.09244
*   **Stop Loss:** 1.09365 (above the recent high)
*   **Drawdown:** Approximately 5 pips
*   **Risk Management:** The presenter advises focusing on a fixed percentage of account equity (e.g., 1%, 0.5%, or 0.25%) rather than specific dollar amounts per trade.

### Fractal View (Five-Minute Chart) and Targets

The presenter switches to a five-minute chart to illustrate the overall trade dynamic.

*   **Fractal Movement:**  Illustrates the up-and-down movement of price action.
*   **Fibonacci Run:** Highlights a Fibonacci retracement from the low of the price run.
*   **Initial Target:** 50% retracement level
*   **Ultimate Target:**  An imbalance (inefficiency) lower down the chart.

### Conclusion

The presenter concludes by reiterating that the example provides a framework and confirms that the presented concepts can be applied during the London session. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the inverse relationship between the DXY and the Euro. Finally, he states his purpose is to teach others to think for themselves.

# **Episode 21: 2022 Free ICT YouTube Mentorship - Risk On/Risk Off Markets**

**Video URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmVXVJE08eQ

## **Introduction**

Welcome back to the 21st episode of the 2022 Free ICT YouTube Mentorship! In this lesson, we'll be looking at the hourly chart on the **Dollar Index (DXY)** to understand the relationship between risk-on and risk-off market conditions.

*   **Comment Section:** Your feedback and questions are encouraged in the comment section of this video. I may not respond to every post individually, but I use your questions to shape future lessons. Remember to take notes, as many of your questions may be answered as the mentorship progresses.

*   **Disclaimer:** This information is for educational purposes.

## **Dollar Index and Risk Sentiment**

### **The Question of Dollar Index Utility**

A common question, especially from those new to my teachings, is whether the **Dollar Index** is useful for Forex trading.

*   **Dollar's Influence:** A rising dollar typically puts pressure on foreign currencies, making sustained rallies less likely. Conversely, a falling dollar usually allows foreign currencies to rally.

### **Risk On/Risk Off Dynamics**

This inverse relationship stems from the risk-on/risk-off dynamic:

*   **Risk-Off Scenario (Dollar Up):** When the dollar rises (as shown in this example), it signals a risk-off environment.
    *   **Flight to Quality:** Money flows into the dollar (perceived as a safe haven).
    *   **Decline in Risk Assets:** Funds move out of riskier assets like foreign currencies and stocks.
    *   **Example:** I have been suggesting that the Euro/USD pair will go lower, and today it did.

*   **Application:** This concept applies to the stock market and index futures as well. While I focus on index futures in this mentorship, the principles are universal.

### **Cryptocurrency Disclaimer**

*   **My Stance:** I do NOT trade cryptocurrency. I have zero experience trading crypto beyond demo accounts and have no intention of entering that asset class. Many students who trade crypto swear by my concepts, but it is not my area of expertise.
*   **Focus:** My specialty is in **Forex** and **Futures** trading.

## **Dollar Index Forecast and Market Relationships**

### **Recap of Previous Forecast**

Let's revisit my forecast from previous episodes:

*   **Dollar Index Drop:** I predicted the Dollar Index would likely drop to around **99.92**.
*   **Rally to Equal Highs:** I anticipated a rally from that low to run the relative equal highs, with objectives around **102-103**.

### **Dollar Index vs. E-mini S&P 500 Relationship**

Look at the inverse relationship between the **Dollar Index** and the **E-mini S&P 500 futures (June 2022 contract)**. As the dollar found its low (as predicted), the E-mini S&P 500 was under pressure.

*   **Bearish Order Block on E-mini S&P 500**

I mentioned a bearish order block on the E-mini S&P 500 daily chart.

### **Mentorship Benefits**

This is what mentorship is like: learning to anticipate likely market movements with logical tools.

*   **Simplification:** Despite what some may say, my concepts are designed to simplify trading, not complicate it. They help you develop bias and leverage intermarket relationships for confidence.
*   **Factors Influencing Forecast:** The prediction of the 99.92 level, the rally from there, and the expected decline in the E-mini S&P 500 were all based on:
    *   Bullish Dollar outlook.
    *   Seasonal tendencies (May being a typically weak month).
    *   Nearly 30 years of experience.

## **E-mini S&P 500 Analysis**

### **Daily Chart and Bearish Order Block**

Here's the daily chart of the E-mini S&P 500, highlighting the bearish order block I previously discussed:

*   **Order Block Levels:**
    *   Low of the order block
    *   Open of the order block
    *   Mean threshold (halfway point)
    *   High of the order block (least likely level to be traded to)

*   **Market Behavior:** The market rallied into the order block, then experienced the expected weakness heading into May, reaching for the relative equal lows on the daily chart.

### **Target for Sell-Side Liquidity**

The next draw on liquidity is below these relative equal lows.

*   **Potential Scenarios:**
    *   A run below the equal lows followed by a retracement (especially if a portion of the move is left open).
    *   A straight drop to the old low.

### **Trading Strategy**

How we trade upon reaching that low is uncertain. Will it be a violent drop or a sharp retracement?

*   **Current Expectation:** I expect the daily candles to continue expanding lower, reaching for this target area.

### **Daily Range Analysis**

The daily range moved slightly above the previous day's high (Monday), then failed and accelerated downward, falling just short of running the relative equal lows.

*   **Continued Expectation:** I still believe we're likely to move lower to the relative equal lows.

## **15-Minute Time Frame Analysis**

### **Midnight Opening Price**

Here's the 15-minute chart with the midnight New York time opening price marked.

*   **My Expectation:** I was expecting a slightly higher rally, potentially flirting with the 4320 level, before a rollover.

### **Power 3 Explanation**

I believe Michelle asked in the comment section about the Power 3.

*   **Power 3 in Action:** The power 3 was indeed in effect but very small.
*   **London Session Breakdown:** At 3:00 AM New York time (London session), the market broke down.
    *   **Time Zone Clarity:** To avoid confusion with daylight savings time, set your TradingView chart to New York time (instructions provided in the video). If you do that you'll not have to worry about anything.

### **Trade Missed**

Personally, I missed a setup, I was expecting the poke above the opening and then a break down, but it didn't happen.

*   **Bearish Order Block Retest:** The market broke down, retraced into a bearish order block and imbalance, and then rolled over just before the 9:30 opening.

### **Market Flow**

*   The market moved into the lunch hour with a small retracement and then aggressive selling continued into the PM session towards the close.

### **Midnight Local Time Usefulness**

The opening price at midnight local time is useful for trading the London session (2:00 AM and 5:00 AM New York time).

*   **Bearish Scenario:** If bearish, I look for a rally above that opening price during London as an ideal scenario.
*   **Today's Action:** Today, there was very little movement above that opening price.

### **Missing Setups**

Sometimes the market just wilts and goes lower. In this instance, I missed a setup.

*   **Being Human:** Remember, it's normal to miss moves, misinterpret charts, and make mistakes.
*   **Importance of Stop Loss:** This is why stop losses, controlled position sizing, and flexibility are crucial.
*   **Experience:** With experience, you'll become better at recognizing these situations.

## **8:30 AM Opening Price Analysis**

### **Distinction Between Opening Prices**

*   **Midnight vs. 8:30 AM:** It's important to distinguish between the midnight opening price and the 8:30 AM opening price. The lines are light on the chart to show the highs and lows of those respective candles.

### **Midnight NY and Bearish Setup**

The opening of the day, midnight NY, is where I look for the power 3 daily range setup. I want to see something rally above that opening price if I'm bearish.

*   **Today's Action:** Today, the opening price here was not much of a factor for anything except for a bearish setup. The price opened at midnight and basically kept going lower from there.

### **8:30 AM Opening Price**

*   **Similar Approach:** I use the 8:30 AM opening price for Power 3 analysis in the New York session, using the same thought process as with the midnight opening.
*   **Today's Action:** I was looking for weaker prices and that for a short, does it rally above the 8:30 am opening price? No.

### **Judas Swing**

I'm looking for that **Judas Swing**. A false rally, or suspect rally, and I like to fade those types of moves.

*   **Experience Required:** It takes experience and backtesting to confidently fade those moves.
*   **Today's Market Condition:** It's too heavy to move up.

I hope this refined version is helpful and easy to follow!


Here's the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining all details and nuances while improving readability:

## **Bearish Market Conditions and Trading Strategies**

### **Market Analysis: Opening Price and Bearish Sentiment**

"Being bearish, I've made it public knowledge here. Did we rally above the opening price at midnight? No. Did we rally above the opening price at 8:30? No. And we're bearish. What does that indicate to you? Obviously, with the benefit of hindsight, it's extremely bearish. It can't even rally to a short-term premium above the opening price at key levels and time. So, we have an extremely heavy bearish market.

*   **Implication:** It's not going to give us these stunning little short-term rallies that we can fade.
*   **Trading Approach:** It's just going to stay heavy, and either you get in where you can find small little pockets of imbalance, or you miss the move entirely."

### **Personal Trading Experience**

"Now, as it happens today, my wife went on a trip. I had to take her to the airport. I was only able to capture two thousand dollars worth of movement in the E-mini S&P. That's the only thing I could capture. When I got back, I didn't participate in the afternoon, and looking at it now, I missed a really, really huge opportunity. There was no trading whatsoever in the afternoon. My money was made short on E-mini S&P in the morning session, and that's all I had for today.

*   **Potential Gains Missed:** If I would have just held on to what I had in the morning, you know, I could have done around twelve thousand dollars today alone, but I didn't hold on to it. I had other things to take care of, and that's that.
*   **Real-Life Considerations:** The reality of things is that real life creeps in. It's going to happen."

### **Challenges in Learning Market Concepts**

"But for those of you that are trying to learn these concepts, these types of movements are going to be very frustrating in the early stages of your development because you're going to feel like they're changing something. They're aware of this. It's this stuff goes on a lot. It happens in the futures markets like commodities like corn, soybeans, gold, oil, um, stocks.

*   **Market Behavior:** Sometimes the markets are just simply too heavy, and they're not going to rally for you to short into.
*   **Concept Validity:** It doesn't mean that they've changed anything. It doesn't mean that the concepts don't work. It just means that this is a market that is extremely bearish, and when it's extremely bearish, you have to trade it differently."

### **London Open Setup Analysis**

"And I'll show you what I mean by that here, and I'm not trying to inspire much outside of the mentorship, but I know some of you have asked this in the comment section, plus it helps my own personal group to understand this as well, so it'll be a little bit of a refresher for them. All right, so here's the London Open setup. This was the move that set up the only real sound entry, in my opinion, that took place today here.

*   **Sequence of Events:** This displacement, fair value gap rallies up, bear shoulder block, fair value gap runs into it, and then you hold it because at the micro structure shift below the short term low the imbalance we went back up in this imbalance here. Remember when I taught you about this?
*   **Trading Logic:** This one here can be traded to on a spike, it can get up in there, but your entry is on the lower fair value gap. Do you see the logic working here?
*   **Stop Loss Strategy:** You are going to use a stop that's going to allow for the market trading up into this one, so you may not like that much risk. You may not be able to take this trade. That's all part of this game, but you can trade a micro, or maybe you could, I shouldn't say that you can. I don't know what all of your risk parameters are, what you can work with in terms of margin.
*   **Paper Trading Practice:** While you're learning in paper trading, obviously you can use anything because it's all hypothetical money, and you're learning the skill set, but the rules are still sticking to what I gave you in terms of the logic. If you have two fair value gaps, you're using this as the entry, and you're using this as the risk. Don't always assume that you can get up here and get the best entry because it never went there, see that?"

### **Signature Price Action**

"So it's things like this, this is what I refer to as a signature in price action. These are algorithmic things that repeat, but you have to have the discernment and experience and know when it's likely to occur, when it isn't likely to occur."

### **8:30 AM and 9:30 AM Time Period Analysis**

"So anyway, let's talk a little bit about the 8:30 time period and 9:30. All right, so here's 8:30. I've got the inbounds here after 8:30. Now, normally with the model I'm teaching you to look for something to the left prior to 8:30. Some kind of short-term high, we want to see it rally up and using the opening price at 8:30, which is here, we want to see it rally above that, run some stops, then break down and create this type of scenario where it has displacement and a imbalance, it rallies back up into the imbalance and sells off.

*   **Model Limitations:** The model doesn't exist in today's price action on the five-minute chart. It doesn't give it to you there.
*   **Coaching and Market Insight:** So I'm going to give you coaching, if you will, to kind of like show you what was in price and some of the things I was looking at to help get in sync with the move, but I didn't ride the whole thing out, okay?
*   **Regret and Missed Opportunity:** And believe me, I'm looking at this today wishing I just would have had at least one of the two contracts I had on, one still, and just let it run, and I could have done, you know, about eight grand or so, but I didn't do it, okay? I was leaving, I was taking my wife to the airport, and it's just better if you're not going to be in front of the charts and anything can happen, you have to get delayed out there, phone doesn't connect with the, you know, the broker, it's just better just to be away if you're not going to be paying attention to the marketplace, just simply completely close the entire position."

### **Overnight Holding Positions**

"Also, I'll throw this in here too, uh, shortly before I started doing the recording here, I saw a question: do I ever hold overnight in these current conditions? I stopped holding overnight like 24 hours years ago. We had a lot of things going on in the world that changed my trust, just like I used to hold things over the weekend and expect continuation going into the opening on Sunday and Monday. I no longer hold over the weekend.

*   **Current Strategy:** So I am 100% in a session or a day and out before the close. Like I'm not holding 24 hours, I'm not holding 12 hours, you know, I'm not doing those types of positions.
*   **Typical Trade Duration:** Typically, my trade is anywhere between 90 minutes to two hours maximum. That's about the the length of time that I'm holding and I'm I'm looking to take mine and get out and then reassess things because there's just too much risk right now in the marketplace all asset classes and things are now starting to get a little wild and it could get a little bit more wilder, okay?"

### **Five-Minute Chart Analysis**

"But the five-minute chart has the imbalance in here. We saw that run and the model I want to see it run above the opening price at 8:30. the opening price at 8:30 is the new york sessions opening price. Now don't get confused with the new york midnight candles opening price because the new york association in the name new york session is the 8:30 to 11 time period new york local time.

*   **Power 3 Framework:** So I'm looking for this framework to offer power 3 which is a fractal element of accumulation manipulation and distribution that's what power three the three things that is empowering you is understanding those three elements accumulation what's accumulating short positions okay why because it's bearish so smart money would accumulate short positions then anticipate manipulation above the opening price they would assume more short positions there then it starts to go the other direction and they distribute their short positions at some important low that's that we're able to forecast then obviously it's relative to those daily equal lows and old daily lows and projections with the fib all those ideas come to mind in concert with in agreement as well with time of day okay?
*   **Lunch Hour Dynamics:** so we're looking at a movement down into around the lunch hour beginning at noon okay creates the important low there we have a retracement during the lunch hour one more time it punches above the high here then it breaks down consolidate start street one two three and then you can expect continuation going into the afternoon session we're not gonna talk about the afternoon session because honestly i wasn't participating in it and it is what it is i'm familiar with this morning because i had some horses in the race today okay?"

### **Four-Minute Chart and Opening Price**

"So we'll start getting a little bit more detail here here we have the four-minute chart the imbalance here this is one again that is not rallying above the opening price at 8:30. now it's showing 8.28 but that's because i'm showing a four minute chart so don't let that confuse you but the opening price again never got traded above at the 830 candle so whatever that opening price is at 8:30 you extend that out in time and you want to see that rally above.

*   **9:30 Opening Expectation:** now when you have this expectation the other aspect of time is the 9:30 opening that's when the equity market or stocks themselves start trading their new york session so what happens at 9:30 what am i expecting at 9:30 well no number one 9:30 is just when the opening occurs and there's initial volatility now it can be whip saw where it can go up and down real short term and go both directions in a small range sometimes it could be a really large range and clear both sides of the buying cell and then whatever the real move is going to be for the day we wait for that to unfold today we can see at 9:30 it just starts to run lower it doesn't give us a rally at all so it just starts to speed up what's already in motion from three o'clock in the morning during the london open session so at 9:30 all it does is just start to accelerate down okay?"

### **Three-Minute Chart and Bearish Order Block**

"and the same ideas being shown on a three-minute chart you can see here that a little imbalance gets a little bit more refined trades up into it rather handsomely breaks down and here's another everybody got with a bearish order block now this is one in here where it's useful because you have a little bit more insight as to what it's doing it's too heavy it's not likely to rally there's no reason to look to go long start looking for reasons to get short and anytime you get an imbalance and we're above those relative equal lows on the daily chart because it's going to draw down into that that's the that's the heaviness objective okay why the prices keep going lower lower lower lower is because they're gravitating towards those relative equal lows on the daily chart okay?"

### **Daily Chart and Market Objective**

"so go back to the chart where i mentioned in this video and showed the daily chart i had that little blue line that's where price is being drawn to okay the algorithm is marching every minute every hour every day to that level how long does it take to get there i don't know that but i mentioned in my group that i didn't want to see it happen like we're seeing it right now because it's it's too fast and it doesn't give a lot of opportunities to get in with it and ride it so you either have to have entries like this which unfortunately isn't scalable with the model i've shared publicly but i do have obviously opportunities to go over it like this and show you that how you can still use the idea of the fair value you got to get in with it but you're going to have to leave out the element of a rally above the opening price at 8:30 and 9:30 just creates a lot of volatility okay the initial surge in the new york session as the stocks begin to trade basically."

### **Recap and Time-Based Analysis**

"so as a recap here before i go into the next slide midnight new york time that opening price i used that to trade the london open session that's two o'clock to five o'clock in the morning and also to help frame the idea like say i sleep through london which is ninety percent of the time what i do today like i don't do a lot of london session trading and because of that when i wake up and i'm looking at the market around seven o'clock in the morning or so I'm looking at what has happened overnight and did we create a scenario that I would be looking to trade if I was awake during London if it happens then I know that I'm really built in with an advantage on the daily bias because if I'm bearish and it creates a rally above the opening price midnight time in new york and it creates that rally that little Judas swing that explained many times already and it starts to decline and I'm below that around seven o'clock in the morning I know that I'm likely to create another little short term rally but it would be above ideally above the opening price at 8:30.

*   **Market Heaviness:** But it may not do that and price just remained heavy below both opening prices at midnight new york local time and 8:30 new york local time.

### **Early Trading Challenges**

"so everything was extremely bearish and it was just so heavy it could not mount any meaningful rallies many times in my early development I got crushed on days like this where it felt like okay it's too too low now it can't just keep going lower so I'm going to try to buy it now because you know indicators told me they were oversold 1992 1993 1994 I blew account after account after account doing that and it's frustrating now obviously with three decades of experience behind me I know what it's trying to do and where it's trying to get to and it's getting there in a really fast rate of speed.

*   **Desire for Engagement:** Now obviously you can get there a lot faster than that but I don't I don't want to do that because it gives no real opportunity for me to engage and participate in and it doesn't give you as the student to engage also with your demo or paper trading account to practice.

### **Market Realities and Acceptance**

"but as real life sometimes is it's unfair okay it doesn't give us what we want sometimes our expectations and our wants are denied and in today's climate that is not popular that's why this market and trading these markets is very very difficult especially for like the millennials okay that ideal perfect always come exactly as I expected sometimes is denied and either you accept that and navigate the markets within perfection and without the ideal scenario for your model or you're comfortable with just letting go and not doing anything and being accepting when it comes to big moves and you can't participate in it.

*   **Missed Opportunities:** There's lots of moves folks over the last 30 years that I missed that were huge big huge moves for instance bitcoin I called that thing I called that thing at 7 500 to 20 000. and then right before 20 000 I said it wasn't going to 20 000. it was 19 700. and I said it's going to go to 6 000. and everybody laughed and went down and I said I was going to go down 3 000 but it went down to like 32 and then I think a couple times I I had it wrong publicly and then I said that we would go to 20 000. by christmas I think it was uh 2020 and then I said thirty thousand modern years and I was off by about 18 hours it went to 30 000 on the second I believe it was on january 2021 and then I said 55 000 and 66 000 that was about as far as I could see it go and we went just a little bit above 66 000 and hasn't been doing much since but I didn't do anything with that with real money so I missed a huge run in something that would have otherwise paid out a lot of money and I've missed a lot of moves in the futures markets and a lot of commodities I missed a lot of stock moves you know while I was teaching forex there's a lot of stock movement and index futures that I didn't participate in guess what it's okay I'm able to still find trades I'm not starving.

### **Acceptance of Missed Trades**

"and that's the the reality you're going to have to come to terms and the grip with you have no way of participating in every single move and don't think that you're going to find every big move you're not going to participate in every single price swing you're not going to folks I miss moves you're going to miss moves and it's okay it's part of this game this business is going to still run and do the"


Here's the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining all details and nuances while improving readability:

## **Acceptance and Adaptability in Trading**

### **Acknowledging Imperfection and Missed Opportunities**

"So give yourself the permission, okay, to be human. You're going to do it wrong sometimes. You're going to see it for something it's not, and you're gonna miss that big move. I had a little piece of this today, but I didn't get the whole thing. I wish I would have, but I didn't, and it's okay.

*   **Self-Forgiveness:** I forgive myself for being a good husband, taking my wife to the airport.
*   **Addressing Critics:** I know this is all too much stuff, and you don't care. Some of you like to say those things in the comments, 'get to the point.'

### **Dealing with Life's Interruptions**

"The point is, you do this, you're going to have these elements creep in, and how are you going to deal with it? You're going to get mad and go on social media, you know, blurry out and curse and say, 'these markets suck?' No, that's not what you should be doing. You should just reason with yourself ahead of time, say, okay, I'm not going to be able to do everything, I'm not going to participate in every single move, and this is what happens sometimes.

*   **Model Integrity:** It doesn't mean the model is broken, I promise you.
*   **Future Expectations:** Over the next couple of weeks, you're gonna see the model delivering like it's done in the past, and it's fine.
*   **Market Dynamics:** There's gonna be times when the market shifts in and out, and the market structure is just too overwhelmingly bullish or too overwhelmingly bearish.
    *   In this instance, you know, the bearishness I gave you guys just was a lot more bearish than the model would permit for entry.

### **Two-Minute and One-Minute Chart Analysis**

"But you can see there's fair value gaps in here you can use to participate.

*   **Two-Minute Chart Refinement:** Dropping down to a two-minute chart, let's see again, refined in real nice here and then once more in here.
*   **Noon Time Low:** Dropping down into that noon time creating an important low, which is what I taught you in this mentorship already.
*   **One-Minute Chart Imbalance:** That two-minute imbalance you can see on one minute is right here and here, really nice delivery there.

### **Trading Strategy in Overwhelmingly Bearish Markets**

"And these are just simple little imbalances to get in sync with what is already in motion, not needing to see it rally above the 8:30 opening price because it's not likely to.

*   **Trading Options:** So it takes a little bit of courage to get in here and trade these types of setups, but that's what you do, or you don't do anything, and you just tape read, you watch it.
*   **Acceptance:** When it doesn't, it's okay.
*   **Study and Application:** I would like to see it drop here and into the drop, yes, and you study that and give you another fair value gap in here that's not highlighted, and it rallies up to a fair shoulder block and sells off, and your stop is above here.

### **Stop Loss Management and Noon Time Targets**

"Just because it goes down lower, it doesn't mean jam your stop loss to here because that's what happens.

*   **Stop Loss Discipline:** You need to have time and price behind you before you start moving your stop loss, and ultimately trades obviously lower into that noon time.

### **Upcoming TradingView Tutorial**

"All right, so I think that's going to be it.

*   **Next Episode Preview:** The next episode on Thursday, I'm going to show you a couple of things inside the trading platform on TradingView that I think are useful. It answers a few things, and one of those students made mention that could I literally go in and show how to set up the Fibonacci, so I thought it was kind of simple already, but obviously, some of you are really, really new, and you're not familiar with the TradingView platform.

### **Content Structure and Closing Remarks**

"So I'm going to add that at the end of the video on Thursday coming up, okay, so that way it's at the end, and anybody that already knows how to do it, they don't have to go through and watch all that stuff. But I'll give you another teaching and lesson obviously on Thursday, and until I talk to you then, be safe."

## ICT Mentorship - Free YouTube Mentorship 2022 - Market Analysis

**Video URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKc_i90chVg

### Introduction

Welcome back to the ICT Mentorship! This is the free YouTube mentorship for 2022. We'll be reviewing the E-mini S&P daily chart (June 2022 delivery contract month) and recapping previous analysis.

### Recap of Previous Analysis

*   **Bearish Order Block:** A bearish order block was previously identified as an area to watch.
*   **Seasonal Tendency:** We are entering a seasonal tendency, expecting lower prices.
*   **Risk Off:** A decline in equities markets was expected, linked to a risk-off environment and the dollar.
*   **Drawdown to Relative Equal Lows:** The expectation was for the market to draw down into the relative equal lows.

### TradingView Tips

Many viewers have been asking questions about using the TradingView platform. A comment will be pinned underneath this video containing TradingView tips.
    *If you have a TradingView tip to share, please post it in the comments.

### Market's Movement into Relative Equal Lows

The market did, in fact, trade down into our relative equal lows. This was the draw on liquidity.

### Order Blocks & Market Direction

New students often want to know how to pick the right order block, the entry candle, and the entry point. However, this is the easiest part of learning.
First, you need to understand:

*   What the market is likely to do.
*   Where it's going to draw to.
*   Why it should get there.

Majority of studying should be focused on reading the tape.

### Live Streams in May - Focus on Reading the Tape

There will be live streams in May to showcase how to train yourself to look for these things.

*   This is a *limited-time event*, not an ongoing commitment.
*   No trade recommendations will be given.
*   No trades will be entered live.
*   The live streams will demonstrate how to outline market movements (similar to the mentorship videos).
*   The focus will be on intraday charts.
*   Areas will be pointed out to study and observe price action, seeking specific patterns.

It's beneficial to see when the analysis is *incorrect*, demonstrating that nobody is perfect and promoting a more realistic perspective.

### Important Disclaimer for Live Streams

*   **Do NOT take the commentaries and opinions during the live streams as trade advice.**
*   **Do NOT act on any information presented in the live streams.**
*   The purpose is observation and note-taking.

Recordings of the live streams will be available on the YouTube channel.

### Live Stream Schedule

*   **Time:** New York session, starting around 8:00 AM (EST). The session will analyze overnight activity and present potential scenarios.
*   **Duration:** Willing to go up to 10:30 - 11:00 AM (EST). Note that not all sessions may be that long.
*   **Frequency:** Selected days in advance, announced on the community tab of the YouTube channel.
*   **Chat Room:** There will be no interaction with the chat room to avoid distractions and maintain focus on the agenda.

### Continued Market Analysis - E-mini S&P

The area outlined previously was identified as the draw on liquidity.

*   **TradingView Tools:**
    *   "Bullseye" analogy: Aiming for the market to draw to a specific point.
    *   "Magnet" icon analogy: Price is drawn down to a level like a magnet.

Today the market tapped into that liquidity.

### Hourly Chart Analysis

Yesterday, the market ran higher but fell short of a high before declining. This led to a normal pause, followed by a gap down and a rally back up.

*   **Imbalance:** Between the low of one candle and the opening of another, there's an imbalance coupled with an actual gap.
*   **Permissible Price Action:** Small wicks slightly breaching the area, but the bodies of the candles staying within the imbalance.
*   **Market Release:** Then the market released to the downside.

### 15-Minute Chart Analysis

*   **9:30 AM (EST) Opening Price:**
    *   Equities markets opening.
    *   Running a short-term high.
    *   Breaking lower, creating an imbalance.

*   **Conditions for selling:**
    *   High was taken out.
    *   Price broke below the low.
    *   Displacement was present.
    *   Price traded back up into it.

    This could be an entry for swing or short-term traders. The aim is for the old relative equal low (the blue line from the daily chart). The market ran down into it today at 8:30 AM (EST).

### Premium and Discount Explained

*   Price traded above the opening price.
*   Price traded above an old high, therefore in a premium. Any time the market trades above an old high, that is a short-term premium because it's going into liquidity.

When the market trades below an old low, that's a discount.

*   Indicators like "overbought" and "oversold" should not be used in isolation. Things can be overbought and still go higher, and vice versa.

Understanding the narrative is crucial.

*   **Market Structure:** Helps frame an idea.
*   **Narrative:** Should align with the idea. Why should the market go where you think it's going on a particular day?

Consider:

*   The economic calendar.
*   Events.
*   Volatility.

All of these should be studied, as previously taught. This will be more practical to demonstrate in live sessions.

### Power 3 Recap

*   **Power 3 (Open, Rally, Decline):** The open rallies up, creating the high. Then a movement lower, distributing shorts below an area where there would be stops.

Smart money would be selling short the buy stops here, writing this out and an offloading their shorts to sell stops below those relative equal lows.

*   **Relative Equal Lows on Daily Chart:**
    *   Traders see this as a breakout.
    *   Long-term trend followers want to be short if it breaks below those areas.
    *   This floods the market with market orders to sell, a perfect counterpart to smart money being short up here.

The target was down here, as outlined previously.
The algorithm is in control and is behaving as expected.

### Combining Logic, Structure, and Narrative

*   Blend principles and concepts with market structure.
*   Look for lower prices, reaching for a specific low.
*   Align with the present narrative.
*   Engage with the daily range using Power 3.

Smart money enters near the high (above the opening) and exits at an important low. The market closes near the level of the day.

### Five-Minute Chart Analysis

*   **Relative Equal Highs:**

    *If you're looking at the lower time frame charts:

*   **Opening Price Considerations:**
    *   Buy-side liquidity resting above.
    *   Highs to the left may also be targeted.

The market punches up, taking out highs. Then it breaks down, comes one more time back above the opening price and then gives up the ghost and aggressively runs for the sell side below here. For some traders, this is enough.

### One-Minute Chart Analysis

Looking closer inside the area where the market ran above the relative equal highs, the market breaks down.

*   **Swing Low Break:** A swing low breaks below with displacement.
*   **Fair Value Gap:** Price comes back up into this area, about the opening price.
*   **Short Entry:** A potential short entry point.

The stop loss should be placed above the candle that creates the fair value gap.
Risk management is essential.

*   The sell side below the lows is targeted after hitting the fair value gap and the opening price.
*   Breaks lower and aggressively runs below here

### Afternoon Session Analysis

*   **1:30 PM (EST) Observation:** Usually some kind of a retracement higher when it's bearish or retracement lower when it's bullish.
*   **Fair Value Gap / Relative Equal Highs:** It runs up into that right there, and area you can get short on.
*   **Fair Value Gap:** It runs up into that that's a short aiming for the line here (relative equal lows on the daily chart).

### Conclusion

Today was a huge opportunity day.


## ICT Mentorship - Live Session Example: Reading the Tape (Nasdaq)

### Introduction

This session will cover examples of **reading the tape**, similar to what will be demonstrated during the live sessions. This morning, I executed some trades to prove visibility and showcase my expectations for a certain run. This analysis focuses on the **Nasdaq**.

### Chart Analysis on Nasdaq

We're going to zoom in to analyze the chart.

*   **Early Morning Analysis:** After waking up early due to insomnia (wife and daughter out of town), I looked at the charts and identified a potential trading opportunity.

    *I want to first ask what you see before I explain what I saw.*

### Identifying a Potential Turning Point

What gave me the realization that the market was likely to turn here and go lower? I studied the entire fractal being shown.

*Pause the video and analyze it for yourself.*

### Key Observations and Market Structure

*   **High Run:** We ran above a previous high.
*   **Market Shift:** Then the market shifted.
    *   Buy stops were taken.
    *   Breakout artists entered long positions.
    *   Relative equal lows were broken.
*   **Shift in Market Structure (5-Minute Chart):** This occurred during a bearish period. We anticipated the relative equal lows on the S&P to be tagged (although this is the Nasdaq, the expectation was for both indices to decline on the daily chart, indicating general market weakness).
*   **Displacement:** There was displacement below these lows, indicating significant energy.

### Fair Value Gaps and Entry Points

*   **Fair Value Gap Identification:** Right above the displacement, we have a **fair value gap**. There's another one as well.
*   **Entry Point:** Typically, this is where you'd enter.
*   **Stop Loss:** The stop loss must be positioned to withstand potential retracements into the higher fair value gap.
    *   This necessitates either a large account to accommodate a wider stop-loss *inside* the fair value gap *or* trading micros.
*I don't want to trade micros. I want to trade 20 per point.*

*   **Order Flow within Fair Value Gap:** The market exhibited additional runs above into the fair value gap.

    *The rules state that if there is only *one* fair value gap, you can set your entry there and not expect a deeper retracement. However, because there's *another* one, expect the market to stab up into that.*

*I know some of you want to be ICT junior and want to be in there on the highest candle when you're selling. But this isn't always going to happen.*

*   **Risk of Awaiting Ideal Entry:** If you're solely aiming for the absolute highest candle when selling, you risk missing moves.
    *Missing a large move like today's can be disheartening.*
    *Focus on entries I've already taught you instead of being overly greedy, or you'll likely miss other moves later in the afternoon and end up with nothing for the day.*

### Fractal Analysis and Multiple Narratives

*   **Market Structure Shift:** Shift in market structure, moving up into a fair value gap with a break lower and relative equal lows.
*   **Fractal Nature:** The move shows equal lows, a high being taken out, a break down. These two candles here moving right below here is the same thing as those two candles being broken with this move here. It's a fractal.
*   **Narrative One:**
    *Shift in market structure.
    *Long-term high.

*   **Narrative Two:**
    *Break lower with imbalance
    *Intermediate-Term High.

The entire move is a fractal, creating a fair value gap where the market trades up into it, with the bodies of the candles respecting that area. It then breaks aggressively lower.

### Swing Points and Market Structure

*This is a long term high, and an intermediate term high by definition.*

We have long-term and intermediate-term highs above me. This should respect the underlying order flow and go lower, and I'm looking for that lower price that's below. There's sell stops resting below that, so as it retraces back up into this up closed candle.

*   **Long-Term High:** This is a longer-term high.
*   **Intermediate-Term High:** This is an intermediate-term high.
*   **Hierarchy of Swing Points:**

    *   This is a turning point, establishing a long-term high.
    *   Long-Term, Intermediate Term because of imbalance.

*   **Short-Term High:** As the market retraces, this becomes a short-term high within a bearish market structure. It should respect the existing order flow and move lower, targeting the sell stops below.

### Order Blocks and Reading the Tape

*   **Up Closed Candle:**
    *   A shorter block

I'm telling you how to read the tape. We're going into this right here so inside this shaded area, this is what I'm going to be executing in.

### Refining Entries on a One-Minute Chart

*   **Calibration:** Refining the five-minute order block down to a one-minute timeframe.
*   **Entry Aim:** Trying to enter around the midpoint of the order block.
*   **Holding Through Fluctuations:** Holding the position through subsequent price drops.
*   **Order Block Fair Value Gap:** Even if it rallies from that area, it's subordinate to the higher swing high.
*The market structure is bearish, I'm not looking at this setup.*

### The Algorithm and Market Dynamics

*   **Market Remains Constant:**
*I don't care how many people learn from this YouTube channel.*

*   **Algorithm Remains Unchanged:**
*Algorithm is'nt going to change.*

*   **Constant Liquidity:**
*PT Barnum said it really accurately, there's a sucker born every second.*

*   **Elements in the Market:** The algorithm is not going to change. There's new suckers coming in all the time.
*There it is, all right.*

### Key Observations and Takeaways

The market rallies up, stabbing above the order block, but the bulk of the volume and candle bodies remain within the order block. The market then breaks down with displacement.

*   **Fair Value Gap Confirmation:**
*It goes right back up into what the fair value gap ends.*

### Trade Executions and Risk Management

I was looking at the chart, it's there and then I'm entering on that candle.

*   **Contract Allocation:**
    *   Sold three contracts at the initial entry point.
    *   Sold two contracts at fair value gap.
    *   Entered one contract after it retraced back up into the bearish order block.

*   **Precise Entry:** As it ran up into the bearish order block, the entry was 13,335, only a quarter of a point above the candle (13,334.75).
*   **Heat on the Trade:** The highest value that candle goes to is 13,339.5, so four and a half handles on one contract.

*   **Pyramiding Strategy:**

    *   Start with the largest position (three contracts) and then decrease the size with each subsequent entry.
*I don't ever do the final one contract and do one more and one more and one more I don't do that that's I don't need to do that.*
*   **Targeted Exit:** Exited all six contracts at 13,285, just above the identified level.

*That's reading the tape that is reading the market that's getting familiar with order flow.*

*   **Market Maker Cell Model:** For long-time students, this resembles a market maker cell model, selling in an area where distribution would take place.

### Trade Statements and Account Growth

There's a lot of things that I'm doing in those statements that have nothing to do with trying to be precise. You guys wanted to see an account go up.

*   **Close Proximity Entries:** TD Ameritrade account is using close proximity entries.
*   **Additional Proofs:** I'm proving to some of my students where if they got into a marketplace and they take a trade and they don't get stopped out but they sit through draw down how the weather that you are not privy to the conversations I'm having with these students.


### Refining ICT Concepts and Addressing Concerns

#### Additional ICT Trading Concepts and Techniques
I want them to step out, but they won't, okay? I want them to think that that's all I could do, and even then they wouldn't budge because they know I can do better than that. This is not even the best; there are other things you can do with my concepts right from this YouTube channel that's more precise than this. I know it sounds hard to believe, but it is what it is.

#### Concerns Regarding Statement Sharing and Misuse
I don't want those statements that I was sharing because, like everything else of mine, people take my stuff, remove my name, rebrand it, and they say, "You know, this is my stuff, this is my creation, this is whatever," and they sell and they scam. If I give statements that have real-time and sales with live accounts and I'm producing like you see here, is it hard to imagine someone taking that and showing it to people and saying that's their results and scamming them?

Think about it, folks. Everything I do, there's a rhyming reason for it. I'm not reacting to someone else's negative Discord. So today, this is the last bit of business here, and we're done.

#### Trade Analysis: Pre-New York Session and Subsequent Moves
I did all this overnight going into a pre-New York session. Then, we had all this back and forth. They pumped it up over the overnight high here, and then we go back into that discussion we had earlier.

*   They ran the high here with this run-up.
*   At 9:30, that's when we expect that volatility to come in, and that's right here, okay?

#### Live Trading Account: Long Position and Scalp Trade
A little bit of whipsaw in here, boom, rallies. In my live trading account, I took a long in here, and I got out at, uh, I think it was 13,409. I wanted 13,425, but I was a little apprehensive, thinking that they may not stab through it. They were getting real close to it, and it's hung around, and I got out just a little bit prematurely, and that was it.

#### Diversions and Real-Life Responsibilities
I didn't take anything until later on in the afternoon, so a small little scalp in here made about 740 bucks, I think it was, and uh, that was it. My attention diverted because I'm Mr. Mom right now. My wife's not with me, and the two children I have that live with us still, I'm in charge of homeschooling them still and running this business, and I have two boxers that are highly demanding of my time.

I know some of you are saying, "Get to the point!" The point is, I'm a real person, okay? So I'm not able to be in every single move because I'm doing other things, and I have a life. I know it seems like I probably don't, but I really do. As introverted as it is and as simple as it is, I love my life, and I like doing the things I like doing in my life, but the markets are not everything in my life.

#### Nasdaq Draw Lower and E-mini S&P Analysis

Hopefully, you got something out of this, and you can see how we did again, draw lower on Nasdaq, and I think that will be it for this one. I'm going to go back to e-minis to S&P, and you can see your relationship there.

*   Both of them moving in concert.
*   Both of them moving in tandem.

#### SMT (Smart Money Technique)
But look closer, okay? This is why I went back to the e-mini S&P. Why'd you do that, ICT? Do you see that? Look at the high here at, uh, two o'clock in the morning, 2:30 in the morning today, Friday, April 29th, 2022. The rally here after 8:30, it creates the high, but it's lower than the high it took 2:30 overnight. I'll go back to Nasdaq. See that 2:35, and we have a higher run on Nasdaq, so this is what I teach as SMT, okay? It's showing a willingness to correct the correlation between like markets. These are closely correlated assets: the S&P 500 stocks composite and the Nasdaq 100 stocks composite. They generally move together in tandem, not all the time.

*   **Bearish Expectation:** If we're bearish and we're expecting lower prices and we see this, but the S&P doesn't do it, that's showing you that this is a stop run and it shows that S&P is really weak.

#### Confirmation Without Indicators
This gives you confirmation without using an indicator, okay? Without having anything on the chart, it shows you, oh well, let me just do it here. When you have the Nasdaq up like this, you can do a comparing contrast by hitting this little tab here, and we're going to add this e-mini S&P new pane, so it plots it below. Then, if you're comparing highs, you want to go over here, good little gear, price source, you want to change that to high, and you can see high to high, higher here, lower there, so it looks like it looks like a divergence. You see that with an indicator, but it's not an indicator, it's price.

#### Intermarket Relationships and Correlation

I use intermarket relationships and correlation and correlation used properly. There's a lot of people that are talking about correlation; they have no idea what they're talking about. But if you look at the idea of this relationship here, it gives you like an x-ray view of real accumulation and distribution.

This is distribution because it doesn't see the same rally higher that the Nasdaq did, okay?

#### Fibonacci Calibration and Chart Annotations

There were two other things on my agenda here. I mentioned to one of the young ladies I would show the Fib. This is nothing else, so you guys are all welcome to turn the video off because this is not going to be teaching really anything. It's for those individuals that just want to calibrate their Fibonacci and also some of the little points that I add to the chart, and I'll show you how that means here.

*   **Price Note:** Had someone ask me, "How do I put those little annotations on?"
    *   Just anchor to the high you want, drag it over. If you hold down the shift button, it'll make it level. You can also do that with your trend lines. So if you want to add here, if you start dragging it, if you put the shift button, it'll automatically toggle it and keep it straight. So many of my students were so helpful because it used to drive me crazy.

Anyway, I know I told you, I warned you folks, it's not going to be arm burners; it's simple stuff for people that are new.

#### Fibonacci Settings and Projections
The last bit of business is the Fibonacci, okay? So I'm going to anchor your Fib to two price points.

*   Once you have it on your chart, highlight it and then go over to the little gear and go to style and style. These are the settings, okay?
    *   All you do is go in, click the little box here, type in the numbers you see just like I have here.
    *   If you want to see projections on how far down or up the moose will likely go, this is for equilibrium. So if you want to see discount the premium, that's what the 0.5 level is, it's 50, and you can see by having this on here, it starts doing standard deviations, okay?
    *   If you want to calibrate it to the daily range here, it'll give you a pretty good idea of where your low should form. Now this was a little bit excited because it went below an important low, but that's enough for government work.

#### Optimal Trade Entry (OTE) Levels

If you want to show optimal trade entry levels and you're pulling the fill up, I'm just taking this off so that way your attention is right on the levels that make up optimal trade trade entry rather the 62 and the 79, okay? And you can change these make them a different color to stand out. I don't like to do that, but you can see it here. So if we were looking at it like this, here's the optimal trade entry levels and it trades up into it here, let me zoom in, can you zoom in itt i young like you are, all right?

*   Here's the high to the low optimal trade entry and trades up into it here and into the fair value got bam that's what makes it optimal. So there's your entry here and you can start going back in and we can do the projections here again.

#### Fibonacci Projections and Standard Deviations

Go into it, now move this out of the way, do one standard deviation, two standard deviation, one half standard deviation, and I think that's enough for this one.

*   The range from the high and the low, you can get that for your discount the premium, but for optimal trade entry, I like to use the bodies lowest open or close in the swings, and you can see how nice that gets right up almost into the 79 percent tracing.

#### OTE Optimization and Profit Taking

The optimal trade entry level here now, if we start looking at the projections down here, we have one standard deviation down here, project up over here, boom, see that hits it, and then we have a nice retracement up. So this is a good area to take profits here and it's also below the low. So how far can I go below this low ICT? Well, there's a standard deviation right there and it does so handsomely, then we have a nice little retracement, then it gets wild right before the opening, okay? But that's the things I promised it would be at the end of this video that was supposed to be on Thursday, and I appreciate you guys being, you know, patient not going all crazy in pitchfork and you know torches. You said you were gonna do a video on Thursday, real life kicked in, folks. All right, and I think that my friends is going to be it and I will touch base with you Lord willing on Tuesday of next week until I'll talk to you then, enjoy weekend and be safe.

Here's the organized and refined version of the provided text, formatted for clarity and readability while preserving all details.

## E-Mini Micro Nasdaq 100 Index Analysis Post-FOMC

**Video URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV9TfwHXuqs

### Initial Imbalance and Potential Sell Opportunity

*   Analyzing the **E-Mini Micro Nasdaq 100 Index**.
*   Identifying an initial imbalance, noting the potential for a "stab up" into a second imbalance.
*   This second imbalance presents a potential **sell opportunity**.
*   Preferred scenario: Price drops to a specific level first.

### The "End of the Road" for Bears

*   Outlining the analysis in real-time.
*   Highlighting the end of the downward movement before a run on Tuesday's highs.
*   Describing this point as the "**end of the race lower,**" symbolized by a "checkered flag."
*   Aiming for a trade down into this area, with the potential for a slight sweep below due to resting sell-side liquidity.
*   Focusing initially on the identified level despite potential for a deeper sweep.

### Trading Strategies and Considerations

*   Two approaches for using this information:
    1.  **Demo Account Trade:** Initiate a trade, targeting short-term lows.
    2.  **Wait for Higher Timeframe Fair Value Gap:** Await a potential trade into a higher timeframe fair value gap due to the volatility of FOMC.
*   FOMC's typical pattern: Initial leg, second leg, fakeout leg, then a real setup.
*   Expecting a drawdown to the blue shaded area.

### Short Trade Setup and Stop-Loss

*   Potential short trade opportunity identified, with cell-side liquidity below a short-term low.
*   **Stop-loss placement:** Above the most recent green candle to the left.
*   Confirmation that no replay button is being used, ensuring analysis is live.

### Revisiting and Shorting Opportunity

*   Potential scenario: Market revisits the bottom of the fair value gap, acting as a support/resistance level.
*   This scenario would present another **shorting opportunity**.
*   Stop-loss placement remains above the high of the most recent green candle to the left.

### Targeting the Bullseye

*   Looking for a "bullseye" below the short-term low, coinciding with the blue line (previously identified as an order block).
*   Potential bounce at the order block.
*   Overall objective: Price to move from the current position down to the "checkered flag" area.

### Understanding Market Dynamics

*   Emphasis on "running" Tuesday's high versus "sweeping" it.
*   **Sweeping:** Shallow movement above or below a low/high before reversing.
*   **Running:** Moving directly through the high and continuing upward.
*   Scenario planning:
    *   If incorrect, price may go down to the "bullseye" before rallying.
    *   Preferable scenario: Trade down into the blue shaded area.

### Vocabulary Clarity

*   Defining sweeping buyside liquidity as going up a little before going down and reversing.
*   Defining running equal highs as running through it and continuing.

### Expansion and Bearish Order Block

*   Adjusting the chart due to time considerations and additional candles.
*   Identifying a **bearish order block**, which could be revisited before resuming the downward trend.

### Approaching Cell Side Liquidity Pool

*   Identifying a cell side liquidity pool and marking visually to see when price drops below.

---

## Market Update and Post-Analysis

### Confirmation of Price Action

*   Market traded down into the blue shaded area, respecting it.
*   Minor dip below the area deemed acceptable.
*   Market turned and ran Tuesday's highs.

### Fibonacci Expansion and Targets

*   Low at the turn after touching the blue shaded area to run to the swing high around 13150.
*   Fibonacci expansion used from the low to the swing high, targeting 13437.
*   The majority of the move was outlined beforehand on the community tab.

### Range Measurements

*   Question mark on the chart anchored to the high at 2:00 down to the low.
*   Measuring the range to identify targets.
*   The turquoise fair value gap is below 50% of this range, acting as a target.

### Trade Setups Breakdown

*   Identifying **eight potential trades** within this scenario.
*   Emphasizing the importance of individual setup preferences.
*   The goal is not to force everyone into the same setup.
*   Instead, students should find comfort in the concepts and how they apply to current market conditions.
*   The highlighted setup (the highest form of analysis) accurately predicts where the price will draw to before turning.

### Integrating Knowledge

*   Combining the provided analysis with previously shared insights (FOMC drop at 2:00, initial leg completion around 2:30).
*   The algorithmic delivery aligns closely with these expectations.

### Fibonacci Tool

*   Now switching to fib portion to explain.

### Fibonacci Retracement and Targets

*   Anchoring Fibonacci from the low up to the high to find upside objectives.

### Extreme Fibonacci Objectives

*   Using the extreme target as one potential objective

### Body To Body

*   That the body to body made more sense and aligned with initial targets

### Trade Recap and Setups (Detailed Breakdown)

*   Breaking down the potential trades and setups:
    *   **Setup 0:** Run ahead of FOMC = gambler's setup.
    *   **Setup 1:** Drop down then the Fair Value Gap trade
    *   **Setup 2:** Return to the Fair Value Gap
    *   **Close shorts if its a scalp, buy long with target Fair Value Gap
    *   **Setup 3:**Short to the objective
    *   **Setup 4:** Drop down = a buy and can be shared as an order block.
    *   **Setup 5:** Rally to closed down candles as a support
    *   **Setup 6:** Buyers and Sellers = small imbalance

### Disclaimer and Learning Objectives

*   Emphasis that the analysis is not an invitation to trade FOMC or NFP events due to inherent risks.
*   Benefits of studying these events in hindsight or live for educational purposes.
*   Observing how liquidity is taken, how price runs to the extreme of the range, and how institutional order flow is delivered.
*   Hope for insightful content and focus on safety.

# Episode 24: Free ICT Mentorship 2022 - Mindset and Responsibility

**Video URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv0ey5UyOmY

## Importance of Mindset

*   **Purpose:** It's important to understand why you're watching these videos.
    *   Are you genuinely trying to learn?
    *   Are you just seeking entertainment?
    *   Or are you intending to disrupt or cause chaos?
*   **Disruptive Behavior:** Disruptive individuals are not welcome and will be banned.
*   **Comment Section:** The comment section is open to steer the future direction of the lessons based on respectful questions or concerns.

## Learning & Backtesting

*   **Real Market Focus:** The teachings are based on real market delivery, not gimmicks.
*   **Development Stage:** We're in the early stages of the mentorship.
*   **Backtesting is Key:** Focus on backtesting the patterns in your old charts, *not* trading or demo trading.
*   **Future Backtesting Episode:** A dedicated backtesting episode will be provided.
*   **Responsibility and Attentiveness:** You must be responsible, attentive, and listen to apply the teachings to your own trading journey.
*   **Avoid Premature Trading:** Don't attempt to trade live simply after seeing the pattern a few times. This is not the proper way of doing it.

## Community Engagement on YouTube

*   **Community Posts:** An often overlooked part of the ICT experience is the community posts on YouTube.
    *   Go to the YouTube channel and click on the community tab.
    *   It acts as a "Twitter-like" update area.
    *   Prompts, ideas, and encouragement will be shared to help you think about your trading journey.
    *   Sometimes, specific YouTube channels or videos are shared for reference.
*   **Comment Section vs. Community Posts:** While you can't directly communicate *to* the mentor via community posts, you can post anything in the comment section.
    *   Disrespectful comments will result in being banned.
*   **Easy Blocking:** Blocking users is easy and will be done for disruptive behavior.

## May 5, 2022 Community Post Example

*   **Date Awareness:** Acknowledging that the date is May 5th, 2022. (The mentor admits to forgetting to include dates sometimes, as he's used to Twitter's automatic timestamps.)
*   **The Post:** A post made this morning.
    *   "Good morning constant reader I know right that FOMC was pretty neat huh now try this one open your Nasdaq 15-minute chart and e-mini s p 15-minute charts drop a horizontal line across those smooth criminal highs in both index I'll explain what that is in a moment see how we dropped into a discount overnight study how they treat those relative equal highs today and non-farm payroll Friday as you were"
*   **Chart Interaction:** Encouraging everyone to open their charts and actively interact with the market.
*   **Specific Focus:**
    *   A blue arrow indicates the specific area of interest on the chart.
    *   Watching for a "Judas Swing" (a drop down) at 9:30 AM.
    *   If it goes into the specified area and creates displacement, then looks for a fair value gap.
    *   If it trades back down into a fair value gap inside that displacement, then a long position could be considered, targeting 4303.
*   **Important Disclaimer:** Studying the chart is *not* an instruction to buy or sell anything.

## Live Trading and Responsibility

*   **Past Requests:** For years, there have been requests for live trading sessions.
*   **Reason for Refusal:** The primary reason for not doing live sessions is the lack of responsibility exhibited by many traders.
*   **Bias vs. Trade Idea:** Stating what might happen is just bias and logic, not a trade idea.
*   **Mindset is Crucial:** Mindset is absolutely essential for success.

## The Critical Importance of Mindset and Risk Management

*   **Turn the Video Off:** Those who are already bored or not paying attention should turn the video off.
*   **Highly Technical Material:** This information is highly technical.
*   **Simplification:** Simplified approaches are used to get right to the point.
*   **Potential Pitfalls:** Lack of attention to the teachings will be detrimental.
*   **Success Factors:**
    *   How you think about yourself.
    *   What you think you're capable of doing.
    *   The management, observation, and respect of risk.
*   **Realistic Expectations:** This is not about luxury cars and watches.
*   **Genuine Care:** The instructor genuinely cares about the success of the viewers.
*   **Critical Thinking:** You're being trained to be a critical thinker.

## Example: The Poster Child for Why Live Trading is Avoided

*   **Comment Section Example:** Highlighting a comment from someone who supposedly lost a thousand dollars.
    *   "Just lost a thousand thanks a lot"
*   **Uncertainty:** The commenter's sincerity and actual actions are unknown (could be a troll).
*   **Key Point:** This illustrates why live trading with entries, stops, and targets is avoided.
*   **Individual Responsibility:** Losses are the fault of the individual trader, not the instructor.
*   **Demo/Paper Trading Focus:** All teachings are under the guise of demo and paper trading.
*   **Compliance:** This approach ensures compliance and avoids giving trade advice.
*   **Market Opinions vs. Trade Advice:** Market opinions are not trade advice.
*   **Paid Mentorship Agreements:** Paid mentorship students sign agreements acknowledging that everything is for demo and paper trading.
*   **Benefits of Demo Trading:** Demo trading allows you to think without the emotional tug-of-war of real money.
*   **Impatience:** Some are impatient and want instant results (a "secret signal service").
*   **No Future Mentorships:** There will be no more paid mentorships because of this type of behavior.
*   **Lack of Readiness:** Most are not ready to trade this model with live funds yet, because the training is not complete.
*   **Focus on the Boring Stuff:** The "boring stuff" (mindset, risk management) is the most important.
*   **Disruptive Comments:** Comments that seek to distract viewers from the real lessons will be deleted.
*   **Respectful Disagreement:** Respectful disagreement is allowed and will remain in the comment section.

## Example: Individuals Who Cannot Be Taught

*   **The "Unteachable" Individual:** Highlighting another example of someone who cannot be taught.
*   **Potential Troll:** Again, the person might be a troll.
*   **Inaccurate Application:** The logic wasn't actually present in the marketplace today for this model.
*   **Removed Comments:** Disrespectful comments will be removed, even if the user creates new accounts.
*   **Accountability:** Take accountability for your own actions.

## Recap and the Importance of Patience

*   **No Trade Recommendations:** No trade recommendations were given. It was stressed that the post was a study for what to watch for.
*   **Personal Responsibility:** You are responsible for your own trading decisions.
*   **Promise to Avoid Rants:** The mentor promises not to repeat this type of rant in future episodes.
*   **E-mini NASDAQ 100 Example:**

## NASDAQ 100 Analysis

*   **May S&P:** S&P 500 won't be covered, but it's similar to the NASDAQ.
*   **E-mini Nasdaq 100 Futures (June 2022 Contract):** Daily chart example.
*   **Initial Expectation:** This morning, the mentor thought the market might stab above relative equal highs and then run lower.
*   **Value of Backtesting:** This is an example to study and backtest what actually happened.
*   **No Entry Signal:** The market didn't form the pattern the mentor was looking for, so no losing trade occurred.
*   **Model Validation:** This proves the model's validity by preventing bad trades when a specific pattern isn't present.
*   **Critical Thinking Reminder:** Be a critical thinker and consider what's been taught about this model.

## Commentary on the Market Model and Community Engagement

### Model Appearance and Community Feedback

*   The mentor encourages viewers to share their perspectives on whether the model appeared as presented.
*   He requests viewers to include their country of origin in their posts to gauge the global reach of the mentorship.
*   No specific addresses or personal information (like social security numbers) are required.

### One-Hour Chart and Relative Equal Highs Logic

*   The framework involves looking for a run above relative equal highs.
*   The expectation is that price could wash out and go lower after exceeding those highs.
*   The catalyst for this move is linked to it being Thursday, ahead of the Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) Friday.
    *   NFP Fridays are typically volatile but may be less impactful due to recent FOMC events.
*   The focus is on capturing the run above the relative equal highs and then a subsequent drop to create the model being taught.

### Catalyst for the Run-Up

*   Similar to the community post, the suggestion is that price drops into a discount ahead of the 9:30 AM equities opening.
*   The goal is to see a manipulation in price around 9:30 AM.
*   If the focus is on the highs, the expectation is for price to drop down, causing traders to anticipate further declines, before rallying.
*   The key area of interest highlighted in the community post is a specific fair value gap.
    *   Dropping into that gap would be a point of interest to look for a setup.
*   This area is where the trade *might* form, emphasizing that it is not a guaranteed outcome.
*   Time is a crucial element, specifically around the 9:30 AM volatility.
*   The anticipation is for price to drop into the specified area and then look for the taught model.

### Analysis of the Day's Market Action

*   The 15-minute chart shows price trading down into the area of interest.
*   The candle stopped at the old candle high, but the next candle immediately declined.
*   The initial criteria of trading below an old low (running out sell stops) was met.
*   However, there was no subsequent displacement above that old low.
    *   Price consolidated and returned to the low but did not move energetically above it.
*   Therefore, anyone who bought based on this action was not following the teachings.
*   Such trades are considered impulsive, and any resulting losses are the trader's responsibility.
*   The mentor refuses to be a target for those who gamble without listening.

### Focus on Responsibility

*   The teachings are not directives to buy or sell anything.
*   The responsibility lies solely with the viewer.
*   Some individuals may not be suited for this approach due to a lack of responsibility or self-control.
*   It is not about "Netflix and chill," but "ICT and study your ass off."

### Importance of Following Rules

*   There are individuals who joke about not pausing the video to study.
*   Those individuals are unlikely to learn the material because they lack the necessary traits for success.
*   Impulsive actions that result in profits are often attributed to luck.
*   The next impulsive trade is likely to result in a loss, leading to blame being placed on the mentor.
*   The mentor is not obligated to babysit anyone, even paid students.

### Understanding Individual Limitations

*   It is up to each individual to assess whether the model fits their trading style.
*   There are numerous other ways to trade, and the mentor acknowledges his bias towards his own method.
*   The promise is to enhance the viewer's ability to read price action.
*   Adhering to the rules is crucial; impulsive actions stemming from a lack of self-control will lead to failure.

### The Pain of Uninformed Trading

*   Rushing to understand something and then trading with live funds can be detrimental.
*   It is easy to blame others for losses, but the responsibility lies with the individual.
*   Students are not handheld through trades; they must take ownership of their decisions and results.
*   Success is attributed to the individual's hard work and dedication, not solely to the mentor's teachings.
*   The mentor provides the logic, but the trader is responsible for execution.

### Embracing Losses

*   Make a promise to endure losses, not be defeated by them.
*   Trading involves managing losing trades.
*   Every trader starts off as a losing trader, and success comes from learning from those losses.

### Where Setups Form

*   This section focuses on identifying where these setups are likely to appear in price.
*   The expectation is for them to appear after a run above an old high or relative equal highs.
*   Visually, the concept involves a level of relative equal highs and price moving towards it.
*   After running through those highs, the focus shifts to finding the nearest short-term low.
*   Taking out that short-term low with displacement is the trigger.
*   This energetic move taking out a short-term low is the foundation of the setup.
*   Once this occurs, the trader can then look for the fair value gap within that area.
*   If the relative equal highs were traded through, this scenario would be expected.

### Example Scenario and Expected Movement

*   Before the market ran above those relative equal highs, the mentor was watching the area where price was trading down.
*   This was considered a potential low, and the expectation was for price to move in a specific way after reaching a fair value gap.
*   However, there was no movement to set up that run, and the expected scenarios did not materialize.
*   Another approach is presented as a cell version, with the concept reversed for going long.
*   If there is an old fair value gap above, the principles can be applied in reverse.


## Expanding on Fair Value Gaps and Market Structure

### Applying Fair Value Gap Logic

*   When the market is below an old **fair value gap** and trading upwards, with a bearish outlook anticipating a move up to that gap, the same logic applies as with **relative equal highs**.
*   Once the price trades into that **fair value gap**, it doesn't necessarily need to close completely; any point within the gap is acceptable.
*   To simplify the process:
    *   Treat the low of the **fair value gap** using the same logic as **relative equal highs**.
    *   This removes the ambiguity of determining how far the price needs to move within the gap.
*   Instead of focusing on the depth of penetration, wait for a specific event to occur.

### Triggering the Trade

*   The key event is when the price takes out the low of the **fair value gap** after trading into it.
*   Once this occurs, examine the preceding leg to identify a trigger indicating a shift in market structure.
*   Followed by the **displacement leg**.
*   With that in place, look for a **fair value gap** within that area.
*   This outlines the two entry strategies for this model.

### Visualizing the Model

*   This process can be visualized simply.
*   If it seems complicated, review this section of the video multiple times.
*   Then, examine live price action and historical data to reinforce the concepts.
*   This logic is algorithmic and repetitive.

### The Day's Missed Opportunity

*   Unfortunately, the speaker didn't encounter a setup that aligned with this model today.
*   The intention was to:
    *   Enter at the low.
    *   Run the highs.
    *   Go short.
    *   Ride the move down.
*   The market structure didn't allow this setup to materialize.
*   This doesn't imply the model is flawed or that profitable trades can't be found.
*   It simply means the market didn't provide the necessary structure for the model to form.

### Avoiding Forced Trades and Negativity

*   No losing trade resulted because the outlined logic wasn't implemented.
*   The required structure for the trade never formed.
*   The inverse of this logic can be applied.
*   The fair value gap highlighted in the morning community post did not produce the expected setup.
*   There was no manipulation to claim otherwise; the setup simply wasn't there.
*   Dwelling on missed opportunities ("*I wish I woulda coulda shoulda*") is unproductive and toxic.
*   The speaker hopes to avoid addressing such negativity in future videos.
*   This clarification is intended to provide a foundation for responding to potential trolling, sincerity, or feelings of victimization.

### Personal Responsibility and Learning

*   Ultimately, individuals are responsible for their trading decisions.
*   No one in the community, including the speaker, is providing instructions to buy or sell anything.
*   The focus is on studying, observing, and watching specific elements of price action.
*   The goal is to identify repeating characteristics aligned with the taught logic.
*   This is not trading advice, investing advice, or money management advice; it's practice in reading price action.
*   The teaching style may not suit everyone; some may prefer unrealistic promises.

### Embracing the Learning Process

*   Success requires:
    *   Preparedness to receive the knowledge.
    *   Studying.
    *   Practicing.
    *   Enduring periods where setups don't materialize.
    *   Coping with missed moves.
*   Missing significant market movements can be frustrating.
*   Dwelling on losses or missed opportunities is counterproductive.
*   Instead, focus on learning from the experience.

### Understanding Losses

*   Missing a move is a loss.
*   Taking a monetary loss is a loss.
*   Even a losing demo trade is a loss.
*   The mental impact of these losses is controllable.
*   You can choose to amplify the negativity or learn from the experience to mitigate future pain.
*   Condition yourself to recognize recurring setbacks and avoid being derailed by them.
*   This important lesson is often overlooked.

### Honesty and Authenticity

*   The speaker emphasizes honesty and transparency, acknowledging that mistakes and missed opportunities are part of trading.
*   If this approach doesn't resonate, viewers are encouraged to find alternative resources.

Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, adhering to all the specified constraints and maintaining every detail:

# **ICT Mentorship 2022 - Episode 25: A Deep Dive into Market Logic and Liquidity**

**Video URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnTXwAuDi9Y

## **Opening Monologue: Reflecting on Promises and Expectations**

*   Welcome back to the 25th episode of the free YouTube ICT mentorship for 2022.
*   **Important Reminder:** This segment is crucial; please resist the urge to skip it.
*   Think back to how this mentorship began, the promises made:
    *   Specific, repeatable logic
    *   Algorithmic patterns
    *   Consistent rules
    *   Focus on time and price

*   **Key Question:** Are you witnessing the promised logic in the charts yourself?

    *   **Important Note:** This isn't a call for profitability declarations. Avoid live trading with these concepts; focus on learning.
*   **Caution:** Avoid rushing into live trading due to initial success. There's still much to learn.
*   **Addressing Criticism:** Some viewers suggest others teach these concepts better:
    *   **Clarification:** This material is being taught for the first time.
    *   **Unique Perspective:** The depth and future direction of this teaching are unknown to others.
    *   **Authenticity:** Many critics use hindsight analysis and borrowed vocabulary.
    *   **Distinction:** The value here lies in outlining potential moves *before* they happen, demonstrating true understanding of the algorithm.
*   **Rejection of Retail Trading Methods:** This approach isn't based on supply and demand, and it is very different than anything being taught by Chris Lori.
*   **Critique of Course Sellers:** Some individuals truncate concepts for easier consumption to sell courses to beginners. This mentorship offers genuine insight without a sales motive.
    *   **Transparency:** Millions have already been earned; this is driven by a passion for teaching.
    *   **No Financial Solicitation:** No PayPal, credit card swipers, or Cash App.

## **Appreciation for Hannah FX (Hannah 4X) YouTube Channel**

*   Expressing appreciation for Hannah FX (Hannah 4X) YouTube channel
    *   Valuable female perspective.
    *   Sincere effort to succeed.
    *   Focus on personal development within trading, regardless of long-term commitment.

## **Fatherly Perspective and Inspiration for a Daughter**

*   The mentorship is approached with a "fatherly" mindset, aiming to protect learners from harm.
*   Motivated by inspiring a daughter to be financially independent through trading.
*   Following Hannah FX serves as inspiration for his daughter, demonstrating another young woman exploring the charts.

## **Addressing Requests for Personal Mentorship**

*   It is not possible to follow every follower's channel.
*   Comment section appearances often lead to unwanted attention and praise, which is seen as rude.
*   Apologies to those whose comment sections were disrupted by followers.

## **Technical Analysis: E-Mini S&P Futures (June 2022)**

*   Moving into the "meat" of the lesson: Analyzing the **E-Mini S&P futures (June 2022) delivery contract price action** on the **daily chart**.

### **Important Pre-Analysis Instructions**

*   **Journaling:** Write down the following information in your journal.
*   **Eliminate Distractions:** Turn off the TV, excuse yourself from other commitments.
*   **Universality:** The concepts taught here work in forex, not just index futures.
*   **Sequential Learning:** If this is your first video, start from the beginning of the series.

### **Review of Previous Predictions**

*   Recap of prior analysis: specific order block acted as a catalyst
    *   **Key Point:** The high of that candle was predicted as an unlikely level to be breached.
    *   **Terminology:** A bearish order block makes it unlikely for price to trade through that level.

### **Order Blocks and the Sniper Series**

*   Order blocks have already been introduced in the Sniper Series (Scout Sniper Series).
*   The Sniper Series is available for free on YouTube.
*   Order blocks are not the complete model or "secret sauce."

### **Fair Value Gaps: The Key Focus**

*   The fair value gap is the easiest concept for new traders to grasp.
*   This mentorship is designed for beginners with little to no prior knowledge of technical analysis.

### **Basic Understanding and Trading View**

*   This mentorship will not cover extremely basic concepts (e.g., what a pip is, how to calculate price fluctuations).
*   Focus is on understanding the time axis, price axis, and chart timeframes (e.g., daily chart).
*   TradingView is the recommended platform for learning and practicing (free version is sufficient).
*   After learning the concepts in TradingView, you can transition to other platforms (e.g., Sierra Charts, NinjaTrader, TradeStation).

### **Recap of Prior Predictions and Analysis**

*   Prior prediction: price would move into a specific area without trading to the top of a certain candle.
*   Anticipated drawdown towards the low points, specifically underneath those lows.

### **Sell-Side Liquidity and Seasonal Tendencies**

*   Areas underneath low points represent sell-side liquidity.
*   **Seasonal Tendencies:** Times of the year where markets tend to move in specific ways.
    *   Example: Expecting sunny, hot weather on July 4th on the East Coast of the United States.

*   **May Tendency:** Index futures and stocks tend to drop in May.
*   This was communicated beforehand.
*   This knowledge, combined with mentorship teachings, can provide a "road map to consistency."
*   Backtest every year through old data and forward test every year going forward.

### **Specific Market Dynamics: Relative Equal Highs and Lows**

*   Relative equal highs led to the taking of buy stops (buy-side liquidity).
*   This was orchestrated by "smart money."
    *   Smart money sells to these buy stops.
*   This aligns with a bearish seasonal tendency for lower prices in May.
*   The market went into an identified order block, aiming for the area under sell-side liquidity points.

### **Smart Money's Net Short Position and Liquidity Grabs**

*   Smart money sold to buy stops, establishing a net short position.
*   To exit the position, they need to buy back at a cheaper price by going after sell stops, resulting in a liquidity grab.
*   Sell-side liquidity rests below certain low points.
*   These areas attract stop losses from traders using models expecting a certain move and for highs to be taken out before trailing stop losses.
*   **Large fund traders** are the focus, not "retail Rick" on MT4.
*   Retail traders often place stop losses in the same areas as large funds.
    *   Difference: retail traders' liquidity is small and insignificant, but this detail is sometimes used to discredit these teachings.

### **Addressing Critics and Demonstrating Understanding**

*   Some "institutional traders" or other YouTubers may dismiss these teachings.
*   The proof of understanding comes from calling out the market moves *before* they happen.
*   The purpose isn't bragging but encouraging investigation of these concepts.
    *   If the concepts don't hold up, they won't hold up.
    *   If the concepts hold up and things are called out before they happen, it indicates true understanding, not luck.

### **Liquidity and Market Efficiency**

*   This approach is not based on retail logic (support and resistance, supply and demand).
*   Focus is on **liquidity** and the **market efficiency paradigm**.
*   Training to identify how liquidity exists or will be engineered in the market.
    *   Buy stops above old highs are triggered so smart money can go short.
    *   Smart money sells short to these buy stops and buys it back from sell stops.

### **Perspective and Electronic Trading**

*   This isn't pattern-based trading or indicator-based trading.
*   It is a unique perspective on how markets have *always* looked.
*   Electronic trading has increased market efficiency and speed.
*   Teaching this will not change the underlying market dynamics.

### **Losing Trades and Realistic Expectations**

*   Losing trades are inevitable, even with this knowledge.
*   The key is to understand *why* you were wrong and avoid toxic thoughts.
*   Focus on identifying *where* these formations are likely to succeed.
*   **Important Disclaimer:** This is not a promise of profitability or a 100% win rate.

### **Concluding Observation**

*   Question: Does the chart reflect what was outlined beforehand?
    *   Answer: Absolutely.

    *   Occurrences are observed here and here (shallow basis).
    *   A significant decline occurred yesterday (Monday's trading).
*   Expanding on the concept of what liquidity does after taking out old lows.

## **Revisiting Past Teachings: The Open, High, Low, and Close (OHLC) of the Last Three Days**

*   Zooming in on Monday's trading activity.
*   Referencing teachings from 2010 on BabyPips.com.
*   **Key Concept:** Studying the Open, High, Low, and Close (OHLC) of the last three days.
*   This was presented as an experiment to see if others would observe similar patterns.
*   **Important Note:** No one identified the fair value gap through this method at that time.
*   The fair value gap concept is being shared because:
    *   It is powerful.
    *   It is unique and effective.
    *   It is very specific in where it forms.
*   Criteria for identifying where fair value gaps form, including unexpected locations, will be provided.
*   Incorporating concepts like rebalancing and formation location.
*   Focusing attention on a specific candle – last Friday's low.
*   If today is Monday, the last three days would be these days.
*   Was there a fair value gap in that? No.
*   Monday's trading action: opened, extended down, and closed near the low (large range).
*   What can be done with that information?
    *   Go back to the previous day's low.

## **Anticipating Future Market Movements and the Importance of Bias**

*   This is crucial for the next trading day (Tuesday, May 10, 2022).
*   If the market opens up and remains below:
    *   Relative equal lows on the daily chart
    *   This swing low
*   The market is in a deep discount.
    *   **Key Principle:** Don't try to pick bottoms.
    *   Don't try to call long-term lows in bearish markets.
*   **Important Note:** Many online sources claim success in picking tops and bottoms, but this is discouraged.
*   Focus on the prevailing market bias.
*   The stated public bias has been bearish.
*   A significant down day like Monday triggers oversold indicators.
    *   **Caution:** Avoid using bullish divergence to catch the ultimate low.
    *   Even if successful, holding it long-term is unlikely.
    *   Pursuing this strategy is a fallacy.
*   When a collective bias exists (not just personal), avoid picking tops and bottoms.
*   There's ample opportunity between major turning points.
*   Being wrong at the end is acceptable; it will become obvious.
*   If draw down occurs, focus on recovery and capitalize on the middle of the move.
*   This concept will be explored further on a lower timeframe after observing today's price action.
*   If price action trades up in this area.
*   A daily chart might show an indecisive day, causing confusion.
*   Instead, analyze the specific formation.

## **Fractal Analysis: Delving into Price Action and Liquidity**

*   Focusing on specific price action in this formation.
*   Transitioning to the part of the ICT videos often skipped by viewers, which is a mistake.
*   Analyzing price action within this fractal.
    *   **Definition:** A fractal is a specific segment of price action being studied.
*   This is a small segment of price action.
*   This is that old low that was extended on the daily chart, now visualized on an hourly timeframe.
    *   Each candle represents an hour, showing the highest high and lowest low of that hour.
*   Consider what you see here.
*   New traders: If you don't see it yet, don't be discouraged.
    *   **Action Item:** Pause the video and try to identify elements based on previous lessons.
    *   Don't rush; take your time to think.
*   Adding detail and perspective.
*   Break down daily ranges by the day.
*   **Key Rule:** Midnight (New York Time) marks the start of a new trading day for the algorithm.
*   The opening price here at midnight on Tuesday
*   Draw a line to show price goes up, goes down, and then closes near the opening price.
*   This aligns with the indecisive daily candle (wick up, small wick down, small body).
*   Looking closer and framing based on the teachings:
    *   Relative equal highs
    *   Old Low
*   What's resting above relative equal highs? **Buy-side Liquidity.**
*   What's resting below the old low? **Sell-side Liquidity.**
*   The market runs above at 9:30 AM, hitting that old low (red line).
*   All the buy-side liquidity is purged.
    *   Buy stops are triggered, forcing traders into long positions or knocking them out of short positions.
*   Buy-side liquidity is likely used to set up a short position for smart money because the bias is bearish.
*   Since the bias is bearish (not trying to pick the bottom), the goal is to act like smart money and look for short opportunities.
*   Where would you offset that short position?
    *   There is a nice little short-term low here.
    *   Taking partial profits below that would be viable.
*   The market runs below the previous day's low here.
*   Using the logic with the idea of rebalancing Monday's daily range, keying off of this level.
*   **Critical Observation:** The buy-side liquidity is targeted first.
    *   If the market had taken out the previous low *before* running up, that would *not* be bearish.
*   Running above buy-side liquidity at 9:30 AM *without* the low being taken out is bearish.
*   This is within the context of the bearish bias.
*   Operating with a bearish bias means the market will likely go up to a premium to:
    *   Run an old high or highs (take out buy-side liquidity).
    *   Allow smart money to counterparty with their short positions (selling to those buy stops).
*   Smart money aims to buy cheaper sell-side liquidity (pool of liquidity to offset/distribute their shorts below).
*   Selling at a high price and buying back at a cheaper price.
*   This isn't a random, unknown low; it's known to everyone after the day closes.
*   However, the liquidity resting below that low isn't necessarily a target for retail traders.
*   This is how to look at the marketplace like smart money, not like Wyckoff.
    *   **Important Note:** This is not Wyckoff, Sam Seiden, or other attributed concepts.
    *   This is a unique approach.
*   If the predicted market behavior doesn't happen, then the model is invalid.
*   However, it works, as evidenced by the increasing number of people studying their charts using these concepts.
*   It's simplified and exciting.
*   Seeing these things pan out consistently is interesting.
*   The second pool of liquidity is the sell-side liquidity.
*   The market runs the buy-side first with the bearish bias, aligning with the teachings.
*   It goes up to a premium, then seeks a discount.
*   Dropping into a 15-minute timeframe for more detail.

## **Refining the Analysis: News, Manipulation, and Judas Swings**

*   The 8:30 AM timeframe is added.
*   Relative equal highs are observed.
*   At 8:30 AM, the news embargo lifts.
    *   The algorithm starts seeking liquidity as early as this timeframe.
    *   It might wait until 9:30 AM.
*   This candle marks 9:30 AM.
*   It hits the area being focused on, rebalancing the entire Monday range.
*   Going back to the previous day (Friday's old low).
*   Seeing it rebalance the big drop on Monday.
*   It tricks people into thinking it's made the low and will continue upwards.
*   However, it's only gone up to a logical level on that daily timeframe, rebalancing the Monday sell-off.
*   On the 15-minute timeframe, this may not appear to be an imbalance, but on a daily candle, it's a large down day.
*   All this movement is significant distribution on the downside.
*   This is a retracement back up to a logical level (Friday's low), hitting it based on the taught elements.
*   It follows the logic shared publicly.
*   Look for relative equal highs at 8:30 AM.
*   The algorithm will start looking for high or highs to run (these highs over here).
*   How far can it go? To that Friday low.
*   There's the framework.
*   This is that **Judas Swing** – the fake rally.
*   Think about what the daily candle looked like before dropping down to lower timeframes.
    *   It was a big wick up and a small wick down, with a small body on the candle for Tuesday's trading.
*   Look at it through the lens of Power 3, as taught:
    *   **Accumulation:** At 8:30 AM.
    *   **Opening Price:** Down here; draw that out in time.
    *   **Rally:** Should take place above that (logical level).
*   It creates the pattern from the mentorship:
    *   Fair value gap
    *   Market structure shift
*   Displacement and distribution to the downside attacking a discount array.
*   This is the Power 3 pattern: Open, Rally up (creating the high), then Trade down.
*   It's inside that indecisive daily candle.
*   Understanding time and price removes confusion and provides clarity.
*   Dropping into a 5-minute chart to build a visual representation of what has been learned.

## **Visualizing the Judas Swing and Market Manipulation**

*   Midnight (New York Time).
*   News embargo lifted at 8:30 AM.
*   Even with limited news, the logic remains consistent.
*   Relative equal highs at 8:30 AM initiate the algorithm.
*   It will run for a premium because the bias is bearish.
*   It will likely return to that Friday low to rebalance Monday's trading.
*   The bearish candle is being rebalanced.
*   At 9:30 AM, the equity market opens – this is the manipulation.
*   Expect this type of move at 9:30 AM, but it begins at 8:30 AM.
*   That hour-long interval expects a run higher to set up shorts when the bias is bearish.
*   The short can form inside that hour or provide the leg for the setup.
*   It's all about studying what the market provides; the rules don't change.
*   When price starts to spool from 8:30 AM up into Friday's low at 9:30 AM, that's the manipulation time.
*   It creates the opportunity that looks like it's going to do something, but it's generally the opposite.
*   Large retail traders see it as breaking out and going higher, so they buy and chase it.
*   Then they get burned.
*   The market runs the daily range against them to take out the sell-side over here.
*   Look inside this 5-minute run.
*   This whole shaded area is the Judas Swing – the fake rally in a down move that will be profitable for shorts.
*   Retail won't see it, identify it, or understand it; they'll be caught off guard.
*   Going into that range, here.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, adhering to all the specified constraints and maintaining every detail:

# **Displacement Price Swings and Fair Value Gaps**

## **Identifying the Displacement Price Swing**

*   The **displacement price swing** is the leg on a five-minute chart.
*   To find your fair value gap, strip the chart down and analyze it, starting from five-minute intervals and descending through four, three, two, and one-minute intervals.

## **Fibonacci Tool Application**

*   Applying the Fibonacci tool:
    *   For those who don't have the benefit of hindsight or may be watching this video far in the future.
    *   Place the Fib tool on the high and the low of that swing.
    *   This has been included for study purposes.
    *   The **4044.5 level** is **equilibrium** or 50% of the range between the high and the low.
*   Why is this being noted?
    *   Because we have this swing low broken.
    *   It could have stopped there and started to move up.
    *   In that case, we would use the range from here to here.
    *   But it just kept breaking lower and lower.
    *   It broke below this low and what looks like this low here.
    *   There were several short-term lows that were broken.
    *   Nonetheless, this is the displacement price leg.
    *   This price swing is shaded while learning.
    *   Then, break it down into lower time frames.

## **Transitioning to Lower Timeframes**

*   We are currently on the five-minute chart.
*   The shaded area will be maintained while transitioning from the five-minute chart down to the four-minute chart.

## **Four-Minute Chart Analysis**

*   **9:30 AM** is this candle here.
    *   That's your **Judas Swing**.
*   **8:30 AM** it starts its run.
    *   This is the algorithmic price run.
    *   It goes to Friday's low, rebalancing the entire range on Monday's trading.
    *   It changes the narrative when retail traders think it's created the low.
*   All the bullish diversions they will be seeing other indicators.
    *   They're screaming "buy!".
*   Breakout artists are looking at this break here because they think this is resistance broken.
*   Now, it's coming back down to it.
*   What is this?
    *   Resistance broken turned support, right?
*   Breaks down a little bit.
*   Then it starts running.
*   Oh, this is one of those instances where it went past a little bit, but it's still going to go higher.
*   You can almost read into the price action what retail would be expecting here.
*   Looking for something very specific in this shaded area: a **fair value gap**.

## **Identifying Fair Value Gaps**

*   Is there a fair value gap?
    *   Would you say this?
    *   Why not that one?
    *   What would happen if I went into that and sold short?
*   First of all, if you did that, you were not following the rules.
    *   From this high down to that low, this is equilibrium.
    *   We need to get to a premium.
    *   We don't want to sell in a discount.
    *   We have to get to this level here, **4044.5 or higher**.
    *   That's a premium based on that price swing.

## **Hardline Rules and Risk Management**

*   Following this hardline rule will keep you out of so many ill-fated scenarios.
*   It's not 100% guaranteed that you're going to follow that and never take a losing trade.
*   There is no secret recipe for trading.
*   Expect to lose money if you're going to trade and you're using live money.
*   You're always going to run into a scenario that will eventually lose capital.
*   It sucks, it's not fun.
*   Nobody signs up for that.
*   They sign up for "well, if it works in my favor, I could make money."
    *   I could make enough money to go on vacation each year.
    *   I could pay my car note.
*   Some take it to an extreme where they're going to be rich and ride around in charter airplanes and drive around in cars that cost too much money.
*   Each to their own.
*   Focus on learning how to read price.

## **Three-Minute Chart Analysis**

*   There is no four-minute chart.
*   On the three-minute chart inside this pink shaded area (the displacement leg), is there a fair value gap?
    *   Pause the video if you need more time.
*   There is no fair value gap here either.
*   Nothing to do yet.

## **Two-Minute Chart Analysis**

*   Drop down into your two-minute chart.
*   Do you see a fair value gap in the two-minute chart?
    *   Pause the video if you need more time.
*   Lo and behold, the unicorn.
*   Here's the fair value gap.
    *   Small little imbalance right in here.
    *   We took out the short-term low.
*   Some might see this if you were watching the two-minute chart.
*   Say you watched the two-minute chart and you saw this short-term low broken here, or maybe this one here.
*   And you saw this is this displacement?
    *   One could argue perhaps it is.

## **Alternative Perspective**

*   This is not twisting the rules, it's just showing the logic of when you put a trade on in your demo account.
*   This movement lower creates that fair value gap.
*   Yes, we have a short-term low taken out there.
*   This entry on this fair value gap, if you utilize that, where would your stop loss be?
    *   It would have to be at least above the candle that creates the fair value gap.
    *   That's this one here.
    *   So, your stop would be above here.
    *   Did it hit it? No.
*   Even if you would have utilized that, you're not stopped out with this right here.
*   You might get scared to death when it's running up after it moved in your favor like this, then comes back and retraces.

## **Stop Loss Placement and Management**

*   You cannot open a trade up like this and put a stop above here and watch it go down here and want to trail your stop loss real tight.
*   You have to hold with a certain measure of risk.
*   This filters out so many people in this industry.
*   They either rush to get out of a trade that's marginally profitable because they can't stand it.
    *   They're making money and they're so used to seeing it turn against them and stop them out.
    *   Or squeeze them if they don't use stops and they get out with big losing trades.
*   Once they start getting marginally profitable trades, they get out prematurely.
    *   They don't even hold it for the model's rules.
    *   Or they trail their stop-loss so tight, so quickly, it strangles the position.
    *   It doesn't even give it a chance to move and breathe.
*   Initially, when opening a trade, the rule is to use the candle that creates the fair value gap's high, just above that.
    *   One tick, two ticks above that is sufficient enough.
*   If you are scared and you just want to use a nice handsome ample stop, you would use a swing high here.
    *   That's a lot of movement.
*   Use micro account positions that you can trade with.
    *   Trade micros if it requires you that much of a stop to sleep at night.
    *   Knowing that what you're doing isn't going to wreck and ruin you.
*   Micros are \$5 per point or handle versus \$50 per handle on a mini.
    *   It's scalable.
    *   It's something that most people should be able to weather.
*   If you can't weather something like that with a micro, then you're really trading and you're not prepared to trade.
    *   You don't have enough equity and you're underfunded.
*   You can't be under-capitalized.
*   Once you place your stop here or here, when do you start moving your stop?
    *   You want to see a larger shift in structure when this low is taken out down here.
    *   Then you can move your stop down.
    *   Say it was up here, then you can move it to here, or maybe here.
    *   Because it's already broke down so it's not going to go down here and come back up here.
    *   If it does, then you're probably wrong, or it's going to consolidate, which means it's going to be an ugly condition to be working within anyway.

## **Accepting Risk and Understanding Market Patterns**

*   Accept the fact that you're probably going to be wrong if it stops you out, but who cares if it does?
*   How many times have you seen this pattern form?
    *   Think about it.
*   Over the course of a week, how many times does a pattern form?
    *   It's forming somewhere every day.
    *   It's forming everywhere, either in the London session, overnight highs and lows, or it's forming in a New York session.
*   Teaching the New York session because you have the advantage of knowing what took place in London.
*   Does it work in London?
    *   Absolutely.
*   Does it work in Asia?
    *   Not that often, and that's why I haven't pushed hard for Asia.
*   For those ideas and those traders that are really focused on trading that time frame and because they have businesses or that's just the way they can trade only, it's the time that they can be in front of the charts.
*   Trade the yen pairs for forex.
    *   Trade the New Zealand dollar and Australian dollar.
    *   They tend to have a little bit more movement during those periods because that's when their markets start.
*   Look for this type of pattern to form there on the one through five-minute charts in the Asian session.

## **Addressing Common Misconceptions and Criticisms**

*   It's one of the most ill-liquid times.
*   Letting the market create those periods of the day where a lot of traders are starting early.
*   Like anything else, we're really quick to get into something, but we rarely ever finish it.
*   Students that come under my wing are really good testimonials about that.
    *   They'll come in, they'll say "I'm going to stick with this," but then they realize it takes a little bit more effort than they're ready for, and they quit.
    *   Trading in general is like that.
*   They think that because in New Zealand, Wellington doesn't really begin today, they think and they teach, and all these other traders have to say, you know, Wellington starts the 24-hour cycle, and it does not start the cycle.
*   The algorithms operate on New York time, and it begins at midnight, period, end of story.
*   I don't care who's brother's cousin's sister knows this guy that works at a bank that says ICT's full of crap, I don't care.
*   Bring those people here.
    *   Challenge what I'm showing you here.
    *   Show me how this is wrong.
*   I'm doing it, I'm proving it, and everybody else is seeing it themselves.
*   Do you dismiss the evidence?
    *   Do you ignore it?
    *   You walk around with blinders on because maybe I'm not the person that fits what you were hoping for in terms of a mentor?
*   Being honest and proving it.
    *   Showing it to you.
    *   It's repeating.
    *   Why argue?
    *   Why wrestle with it?
    *   Take it.
    *   Be thankful.
    *   Do something positive with it.

## **Model Recap and Application**

*   Here's what we have:
    *   The whole model identifying a setup moving back to a rebalance of Monday's price range back up to Friday's low, hitting that level there, and then creating the setup that's happening at the time elements the same way I teach it in the series.
    *   Here it is.
    *   Comes in, hits it, breaks down, pairs up with a sell-side liquidity.
    *   Smart money sells short here and then adds to it here, breaks trades in here during the lunch hour.
    *   Your limit order, if it was used, would be filled during the lunch hour, not around 12:30.

## **Deviation and Market Expectations**

*   The only thing about this day that I did not like is I would have rather seen it deliver this movement here just ahead if not right at 12 o'clock.
*   I was looking for this candle right here to punch down and hit that level, go through it like it did here, and it was just about 27 minutes later.
*   That's not bad, right?
*   Doesn't this make sense?
    *   The market goes up to trick people, and they think it's going to go higher, or not those people that are short making money going down.
    *   In other words, their orders that protects them or puts them in a new trade going up or out of a short trade that buy-side liquidity is attacked.
*   The algorithm goes up there not because people bought it, not because smart traders worked together to get the trade to go up there because of their buying pressure.
*   The algorithm goes up there whether there is sufficient volume or not.
*   Those types of things are hard for them to understand because their faith-based religion on their system prevents them from seeing the obvious logic that's being shown here.
*   The markets are controlled, they're rigged, and they're algorithmically driven.
*   How many times do you need to see these things before you can just lay down all the other ideas?
*   There's no reason to buy other people's courses.
*   You don't need to buy any courses.
*   You don't need to be in anybody else's subscriptions.
*   Teaching rehash stuff what I'm showing you here.
*   If you put the time in learning this, you will not need to do anything else period.
*   You won't need to worry about breakers, so you won't need to worry about mitigation blocks.
*   You won't need to worry about buy-side bill and sell-side inefficiencies, none of those things that's also taught in the things I teach in my private group.
*   Why would you want anything more than this?
*   This is so easy.
*   This is so easy it doesn't inundate you with so many things and variables.
*   My private group, which no one can join anymore, is so rich with things that make it almost impossible for most of the students to pick what they are going to settle in because everything I show works.
*   They can't settle in on one thing because they're like a kid in a candy store, and because of that, they're not really fully engaging with one specific approach.
*   Listen to the comments and read the comments actually some of them are actually in the comments saying this worked for me and they've been charter members for years.
*   Take what makes sense, one pattern, one setup, applied time and price theories that I teach around the algorithmic ideas, and then look for that one setup and submit to it, just that, and make it very, very simple.
*   I can do this with a breaker.
*   I can do this with a mitigation block.
*   I can do this with a just a stop run on buy stops.
*   I can do it with a run on sell stops.
*   I can simplify all this, anything I trade with, I can do this the same way I can strip it down to a simple model.
*   There's no need to ask me to join my private group.
*   Stop asking in the comment section.
*   Stop sending me emails.
*   I don't want your money.
*   I don't need your money.
*   I want to do what I'm


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, adhering to all the specified constraints and maintaining every detail:

# **The Joy of Teaching and the Simplicity of the Model**

## **Personal Satisfaction and Global Impact**

*   I love doing this, and the fact that I'm seeing so many people around the world dive into this and find their own niche in it.
*   It only takes the time to invest in:
    *   Reading the things I'm showing in the chart.
    *   Listening to the logic I'm teaching in the audio commentary.
    *   Doing the homework assignments of backtesting and looking at it.
*   You will decide at that moment if this is something that fits you.
*   If it doesn't fit you, there's no harm in that. I'm not offended by that.
*   I have people that paid me that said, "I just can't make this work for me," and I have other people that are killing it.
*   What's the difference?
    *   Personality and capacity.
    *   Some people can't do it at all.
    *   Some people can do it; they just haven't done the proper things in the right order.

## **A Simplified Approach**

*   This is a simplification of what I have done here in this series.
*   Whether you realize it or not, my mentorship group that has paid me, some of them were kicking and screaming because I've done this.
*   The majority have been very appreciative because they have used this to help understand what it is that they should be doing with all the other things I taught.
*   When I say that, it sounds like I'm dangling a carrot: "Oh, he's got more secret stuff and this is better."
*   There is nothing more readily made and easier than this.
*   I swear to you.

## **Invitation to Private Members**

*   Listen, folks, this is an invitation.
*   If you are a private member of my mentorship, tell everyone in the comment section that this is something that has been spelled out very simply and plainly, better than any other model that I've done.
*   I've done 12 specific trading models in my private mentorship.
*   This one here I stripped down; I made it very, very simple with the expectation my daughter would learn it.

## **The Easiest ICT Application**

*   This is the easiest ICT application you're ever going to get.
*   I literally sat down and said, "How can I take something that my daughter, who has no interest whatsoever, how can I make this so that way she could see it: when to expect it, when will it form, how to figure out where it should be, and what do you do once it forms?"
*   That's what I've done here.
*   Is it hard for some of you?
    *   It would feel like it is, because I'm reading some of the comments, and it's because you haven't spent enough time. That's all.
*   I promise you, when there's more examples shown and you go through the videos a few times, it'll start to become more clear.

## **Avoiding Conflicting Methods**

*   If you're trying to apply other things like Bollinger Bands and garbage like that, you're not using the model, and you're not going to get the results that would be otherwise available to you if you just do what I'm telling you to do and avoid the things I'm telling you to avoid.
*   That's it.

## **A Six-Month Commitment**

*   I promise you this: if you give this three months of study, serious, rolled up, diligently going in every single day, backtesting and looking at it, and then for at least two or three more months of forward testing it, six months with just what I've taught here, I am confident, I am absolutely confident that you will have found your model.
*   It's simple.
*   It's rule-based.
*   It's visually pleasing to see because you know what you're looking for.
*   It's a specific time pattern with the algorithm, so you're getting in sync with what the algorithm is going to do, just like smart money does.

## **Understanding the Composite Man**

*   You want to be like the composite man. This is what the composite man's doing.
*   He's not looking at Wyckoff schematics, and I know that might upset some of you; that's not my intent.
*   They're looking at liquidity like this.
*   They're looking at how the market's going to allow them to fleece the uninitiated.
*   That's just the way it works, folks.
*   You might not like it; it might feel unfair.
*   So, therefore, I don't want to believe this guy. He's talking conspiracies.
*   Call it whatever you want to call it.
*   I call it the market.
*   Until next time, be safe.

# Institutional Order Flow: Trading Against Daily Bias

This video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k26euOG6zAk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k26euOG6zAk)) provides a quick overview of institutional order flow, focusing on trading against the daily bias. The strategy is based on the premise that sell stops or sell-side liquidity has already been taken, and the market has traded into a fair value gap around the **4000** level.

## Initial Trade Setup

*   **Direction:** Long
*   **Rationale:** Sell-side liquidity taken, traded into fair value gap.
*   **Target:** Potential run up to take out buy stops above the high of the day, although not essential for profitability.
*   **Draw on Liquidity:** Expect buy-side liquidity will trigger profitable shorts.
*   **Profitability:** Trade doesn't *need* to reach target to be profitable; target is just the best-case scenario.

### Identifying Liquidity Pools

*   **Sell-Side Liquidity:** Market has dropped below relative equal lows, absorbing sell stops.
*   **Buy-Side Liquidity:** Targeted area, although profit can be taken before reaching it.
*   **Bulk of Position:** Intends to pyramid/build on the initial position.

### Chart Analysis

*   Dipped inside the fair value gap.
*   Went below to take out the relative equal lows (sell-side liquidity).
*   Looking for expansion to the upside.
*   Retail perspective: potential bear flag, anticipating lower prices.
*   Contrarian View: Confident in upward movement towards buy-side liquidity, even if target of 4051 is not reached.

## Managing the Trade

### Stop Loss Placement

*   Trading against the daily bias requires careful stop-loss management.
*   Previous intraday activity: Market traded down three times and took out yesterday's low.
*   Lack of follow-through strengthens the long position.
*   Increased position size to six contracts long.
*   Stop-loss moved up slightly underneath the low.
*   Stop-loss rationale: Located inside the lower end of the fair value gap and the old short-term high around 9:30.
*   Market structure supports the position.

### Target and Take Profit Strategy

*   Buy-side liquidity is the next draw on liquidity.
*   Will take four contracts off at the buy-side liquidity level.

## Annotations and Order Block Identification

### Bullish Order Block

*   Identified and annotated a bullish order block.
*   Definition of Order Block: Down closed candle(s).
*   Higher candle of the two - Order Block is drawn on it.
*   Expecting price to drop down into it to pick up momentum from there.
*   The algorithm will likely reprice higher to the buy-side liquidity or around that 4036 level.

### Real-Time Analysis

*   Analysis and annotations performed in real-time.
*   "Bubble gun and walk at the same time" - ability to analyze and execute simultaneously.
*   Focus on internalizing market movements and anticipating likely outcomes.

### Potential Scenarios

*   Hoping price will deliver based on the premise.
*   If lucky, could expand up to 4051.25.
*   Will take four contracts off above the buy-side liquidity, using a market order.

### Indicators and Observations

*   Response from the order block level.
*   Observing if price will deliver with the premise.
*   Desire for "caffeine bar" – big green bullish candles.

## Practice and Order Flow Reading

### Using Demo Accounts

*   Practicing order flow reading doesn't necessarily require a demo account.
*   Position is taken in the demo account to show others, and to demonstrate being confident in the call.

### Demonstrating Confidence

*   Showing understanding of market dynamics.
*   Cell-side liquidity has been taken.
*   Focus is now on the levels that are more pronounced.

### Identifying Order Blocks

*   Identifying two down-closed candles and drawing an order block on the higher candle.
*   Potential for price to drop into the order block and gain momentum for a move towards buy-side liquidity around 4036.
*   Consideration of the uppermost opening price or the small wick high as potential entry points.

### Price Action Analysis

*   Looking for price to drive higher in big candles (speed delivery) towards the target.
*   Short sellers: Targeting retail traders who are trying to sell short based on imbalances (e.g., the 8:30 drop).
*   Expect to target them.

### Bullseye

*   Identifies the bullseye as the target.
*   Stop-loss is moved to break even or slightly higher.

## Trade Execution and Results

### Taking Profit

*   Plan to take four contracts off when price runs above the high.
*   Will consider moving the stop up and aiming for further gains.
*   Closing four contracts at market.

### Trade Outcomes

*   The annotated order blocks were drawn in real-time.
*   Logic was explained, and the execution was displayed.
*   No need for the market to reach 4051.25 to be profitable.
*   Over \$5,000 (hypothetical) profit in the example.

### Final Actions

*   Change the color of marked areas now that they have been fulfilled.

### Execution Details

*   Buying at the fair value gap and after the sell stops were taken.
*   Buying on order block.
*   Selling four above, and moving the stop loss up.
*   Getting stopped out on the final two contracts.

### Trade Details

*   Buying @ 4000.00 (Fair Value Gap)
*   Buying @ 4031.25 (Order Block)
*   Selling 4 @ 4036.25
*   Stopped out for remaining 2 @ 4034.75

### Closing Remarks

*   Hopes the content was insightful.
*   Encourages safe trading.

# ICT Mentorship 2022: Episode 27 - Massdeck Daily Chart Analysis (June 2022)

**Video URL:** <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLK4Qm6jte8>

## Overview

Welcome back to the 27th episode of the free 2022 ICT Mentorship series on YouTube! This episode focuses on analyzing the Massdeck daily chart for June 2022, specifically Friday's trading activity, along with the preceding days of the week. The main focus is on **identifying liquidity draws and utilizing fair value gaps** within a counter-trend model.

## Daily Chart Analysis (June 2022)

*   **Weekly Trend:** A decline was observed earlier in the week, followed by a retracement on Friday.
*   **Key Level:** The **12,553 level** was highlighted.
    *   It was considered a "clean" level with relative equal highs acting as a draw on liquidity.
    *   Candle high at 12,547.
    *   This relative equal high area was considered a potential target, whether it was reached during the current session or the following week.

### Draw on Liquidity

*   The concept of a draw on liquidity is explained: It doesn't necessarily require a trade to be profitable.
*   **Explanation:** If you anticipate the market moving towards a specific level (e.g., 12,553), look for setups that allow you to participate in the expansion towards that target. It doesn't always need to reach the target to be a valid trade.

## Hourly Chart Analysis

*   **Focus:** Analyzing the hourly chart to identify market structure shifts and liquidity pools.
*   **Key Observations:**
    *   **Relative Equal Highs:** Visible at the 12,553.25 level, acting as a significant target.
    *   **Market Structure Shift:** Occurred after trading down initially.
    *   **Swept Lows:** A low was swept, with price moving below it and then returning above relative equal lows.
    *   **Rejection:** The market attempted to move lower again but was rejected.

### Liquidity Pools

*   **Sell-Side Liquidity:** Identified below the relative equal lows.
*   **Buy-Side Liquidity:** Located above the current price, with the most obvious area being the relative equal highs.
*   **Imbalance:** Minimal imbalance observed in the immediate area, as the area had already been rebalanced.
*   **Anticipation:** The expectation was that the market would likely "punch through" the buy stops resting above the relative equal highs.
*   **Draw on Liquidity Analogy:** Described as a "big magnet" drawing price upwards.

## 15-Minute Chart Analysis

*   **Timeframe Focus:** Concentrating on the trading activity on Friday the 13th.
*   **Initial Move:** Market traded lower, creating lower lows.
*   **9:30 AM Manipulation:** Described as a manipulation event taking out the overnight London low.
    *   A rally ensued.
    *   The speaker was unavailable during this time and did not take any trades.
*   **Afternoon Retracement:** This was the setup the speaker was looking for.

## 5-Minute Chart Analysis

*   **Overnight London Lows:** Run through at 9:30 AM, removing sell-side liquidity.
*   **Rally:** The market started to rally.
*   **Discount:** The retracement into the range between the low and the high was considered a move into a discount.
*   **Power Three:** Consolidation, creating the low of the day (accumulation of long positions), manipulation of early longs by taking out stops overnight, then rallying.
*   **Continuation Target:** The intention was to buy this discount market for continuation up to take out the relative equal highs.
*   **Fair Value Gap Entry:** Buying was targeted inside of a value gap, at or below the equilibrium between the low and the high.

### New York Session Open

*   **Time:** 9:30 AM New York local time.
*   **Action:** Market creates the low of the day, then rallies.
*   **High of the Day:** Created at 12:10 PM (lunch time), followed by a retracement or consolidation.
*   **1:30 PM Algorithm:** The algorithm starts seeking liquidity.
*   **Sell-Side Target:** Given the expectation of continuation higher, the algorithm was likely to target sell-side liquidity.
*   **Relative Equal Lows:** Identified as a potential target, but not considered a significant discount from the current price.
*   **Equilibrium (50% Retracement):** Marked with a dashed purple line.
*   **Entry:** The market drops down into equilibrium and then into a fair value gap.
*   **Fair Value Gap:** Defined by the high of one candle and the low of another.
*   **Time of Entry:** Between 2:00 PM and 2:25 PM.
*   **Displacement:** Occurs on the outside, indicating a shift in market structure.
*   **Bullish Context:** The shift is bullish and considered counter-trend on a higher timeframe.
*   **Rationale:** Expectation of a retracement due to the market being down for an extended period. The algorithm is anticipated to squeeze positions before the Friday close.

## Lower Timeframe Analysis (4-Minute, 3-Minute, 2-Minute Charts)

*   **4-Minute Chart:** No significant fair value gaps visible.
*   **3-Minute Chart:** A potential gap is identified.
*   **2-Minute Chart:**
    *   **Down Closed Candles:** Indicates an order block.
    *   **Fair Value Gap:** Defined by a candle's low and another's high, revealing the imbalance.
    *   **Order Block Interaction:** Price trades down into the order block.

## Trade Execution (Hypothetical Example)

*   **Instrument:** Based on assumptions of using a discount broker like AMP Futures (not a recommendation).
*   **Contract Size:** Example involves buying 36 contracts.
*   **Paper Trades:** Clearly stated that these are paper trades for compliance reasons and full disclosure.
*   **Purpose:** Illustrating execution and theory.
*   **Past Performance:** The speaker mentions past success using a similar strategy on MT4 (which is no longer used), growing a \$100,000 account to over \$300,000 in about a week. This is stated to provide context, not as a guarantee of future results.
*   **Entry Points:** Buying occurred at the beginning and middle of the fair value gap.
*   **Initial Exit:** 10 contracts were taken off after a rally following the move into the order block.
    *   **Target:** Initial aim was to reach the 12,553 level.
*   **Closing Errors:**
    *   Mistakes were made in closing the remaining 26 contracts.
    *   Intention was to close 20 contracts above 12,430 using a limit order, but it ended up closing at market price.
    *   Further contracts closed at market.
    *   One contract was left open and closed late in the day.

### Key Points on Execution

*   **Trading Platform:** TradingView is being used, but the speaker is more accustomed to live platforms, creating some challenges in execution.
*   **Trading on Phone:** Emphasized as a suboptimal practice due to limitations and distractions (real-life example).
*   **Counter-Trend Model:** The market created a counter-trend move but still aligned with the fair value gap principle.
*   **Liquidity and Bias:** Liquidity was above the current price, the day was bullish, and the algorithm continued to price higher.
*   **Entry Failure:** Acknowledgment that the desired entry price was not achieved.
*   **Closure Failure:** The actual closure prices were never above the 12,430 level the trader intended to aim for.

## Framing ICT Concepts and Biases

*   **Freedom within Frameworks:** Students are encouraged to adapt the concepts to their own trading styles, including using a counter-trend model.
*   **High-Probability Setups:** Sticking to the outlined principles during the 8:30-9:30 window is suggested for higher probability trades.
*   **Importance of Bias:** Reinforces the importance of understanding bias for effective use of fair value gaps.
*   **Bias Development:** Emphasizes that mastering bias requires extensive chart study and backtesting.

## Backtesting and Self-Talk

*   **Backtesting Definition:** Reviewing past market moves, marking up charts, and analyzing price action, either using replay features or in hindsight.
*   **The Algorithm Ownership:** "I am the author of this algorithm, so I can operate in it very efficiently."
*   **Understanding the Language:** "You as a student of mine, you have to understand my language first and then you go into the charts and you study with that language."
*   **Repeating Phenomena:** Being able to see repeating phenomena.
*   **Annotation and Commentary:** Encourages detailed annotations and commentaries on charts during backtesting.
*   **Positive Self-Talk:** Suggests using positive self-talk (even if it feels like "lying" initially) in backtesting notes.
*   **Tricking the Brain:** By writing and reviewing positive commentaries, you can subconsciously train your brain to recognize patterns and build confidence.
*   **Activating the Reticular Activating System (RAS):** This process makes you more sensitive to the patterns and setups you are studying.
*   **Chart Personalization:** Making charts more meaningful by adding personality and observations.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, adhering to all specified requirements.

## ICT Mentorship: Backtesting, Self-Talk, and Proof of Concept

### The Power of Chart Annotation and Pseudo-Memories

The interest in the chart is paramount. The narrative you develop while studying is crucial. You should type out your observations, insert them into the chart, screen capture it, and store it in your journal (digital or physical). Over time, these actions will build **pseudo-memories** in your subconscious.

*   **Addressing Critics:** Critics may argue that you are "lying to yourself."
*   **Honest Perspective:** The speaker clarifies that you are creating a pseudo-experience through annotation.
*   **Tricking the Brain:** By consistently annotating and studying charts, your brain is tricked into believing you have witnessed these patterns before.
*   **Subconscious Retention:** This process allows your subconscious to retain these patterns and recognize them in live trading.
*   **Pseudo-Experience:** While you haven't *actually* experienced the situation, your brain perceives it as familiar.
*   **Brain Functionality:** The brain is intricate and powerful but can be "short-circuited" for advantageous study.

### Backtesting Methodology

*   **Focus:** Look at old market moves, study them, and annotate your charts.
*   **Chart Enrichment:** Make the chart as rich and meaningful to you as possible.
*   **Pseudo-Experience Development:** Over time, you will create a measure of pseudo-experience.
*   **Individual Pace:** The time it takes to develop full understanding varies from person to person. It could take weeks, a year, or longer.
*   **Effort Investment:** The amount of effort you put into backtesting directly influences your progress.

### Addressing Doubts and Proving Concepts

The speaker addresses individuals suggesting MT4 rented servers were used. The speaker states that they are not necessary to achieve results.

*   **Account Example:** The speaker points to an example of a \$100,000 account growing to \$354,000.
    *   **Losing Trades:** Notes two back-to-back losing trades.
    *   **Timeframe:** This growth occurred since the 6th of the month (presumably June as per prior context).
    *   **Paper Trading:** Explicitly stated to be paper trading.
    *   **Twitter Activity:** This type of trading was what the speaker showed consistently on Twitter for years.
*   **Proving the Concept:** Demonstrates that the speaker's concepts and methodologies work.
*   **Live Data:** Emphasizes the use of live data with no delay, ensuring the analysis is as real as possible.
    *   **Real-Time Recognition:** The ability to see patterns forming live is crucial for success.
    *   **Algorithm Understanding:** Understanding what the algorithm is going to do is essential for operating effectively.

### Responding to Criticism

The speaker addresses a comment criticizing the focus on proving profitability.

*   **Poster's Intent:** The speaker is unsure of the commenter's intent.
*   **Channel Purpose:** Questions why someone would follow a trading channel if the presenter can't demonstrate their ability to trade.
*   **Sharing Experience:** The speaker states they are sharing their experience and prowess.
*   **Accountability:** "If I can't do this, I'll fall on my face, I *can* do it."
*   **Encouragement:** The speaker aims to encourage those genuinely seeking guidance.
*   **Addressing Misinformation:** Counters "stupid stuff posted on the internet."
*   **Repeated Proof:** States that they don't mind providing repeated proof to dispel doubts.
*   **Dispelling Doubts:** Aims to reassure those questioning the use of rented MT4 servers.
*   **Timeframe for Success:** Reinforces that the showcased results were achieved in approximately a week.
*   **Compounding Effect:** Suggests that consistent application of the methodology leads to compounding returns over time.
*   **Demo vs. Live Account:** Highlights that demo account success doesn't guarantee live account success.
*   **Understanding is Key:** The primary purpose of showcasing the demo account is to demonstrate a deep understanding of the market.

### Closing Remarks

*   **Upcoming Lecture:** The speaker plans to deliver another lecture next Tuesday.
*   **Video Length:** The next video will likely be longer.
*   **Weekend Wishes:** The speaker wishes everyone a safe and enjoyable weekend.

### Episode 29: Market Review (May 16, 2022) & Addressing MT4 Server Allegations

#### Introduction

Alright folks, welcome back! This is episode 29. I wasn't planning on doing two videos today, but based on the comments, some people are a little confused. So, I'm going to do a brief review of what I executed today.

#### Market Bias: May 16, 2022

*   **NASDAQ:** I want to bring your attention back to that **12,553 and a quarter level**, which represents relative equal highs. This was the basis for my bullish bias in the market today, Monday, May 16, 2022. I was looking for NASDAQ to draw liquidity.
*   **S&P 500:** Much like NASDAQ, the S&P 500 had a daily swing low. While it didn't have relative equal highs, I felt a bullish bias was warranted for at least the beginning of the week, looking for a continuation.

#### Tomorrow's Economic Events (May 17, 2022)

Tomorrow, Tuesday, May 17, 2022, will be volatile due to:

*   **8:30 AM (New York Local Time):** Retail sales numbers.
*   **2:00 PM (New York Local Time):** FED Chairman speaking.

The market was lethargic today because of the anticipation of these events.

#### Addressing the "Rented MT4 Servers" Allegations

I want to finally put a nail in the coffin regarding this whole business about rented MT4 servers. I'm never going to bring the conversation or topic up again.

*   Everyone should see now, based on what I've done in a short span of time, that it's not impossible to replicate what I was doing on Twitter years ago.
*   I'm **not** using MT4 here. I can't game this system.
*   I'm using **live data**. What you see is what it is.
*   It's **paper trading** (demo trading), but I do it to prove I can read the market.
*   I'm not trying to brag; I just want to put this to bed.

When people bring up these accusations, take them back to these videos and let them "choke on it."

#### One Minute Chart Analysis: Bullish Bias

Starting with the bullish bias, I went straight to the one-minute chart.

*   **9:30 AM:** The market takes out a short-term high and declines. I wasn't interested in going short because it didn't give me a pattern.
*   Notice there's no fair value gap revisited. The market creates relative equal lows and starts a rally, trading up into the afternoon. I wanted to see it create a buying opportunity.
*   The logic behind this is that it's the day before the Fed Chair speaks, leading to low volatility and a small range day. This requires more experience to trade.
*   **Important:** Know when volatility is likely to occur and when it's likely to shrink.

#### Inter-Market Relationships and Divergence

*   **S&P 500:**
    *   Top-down relative equal lows.
    *   Similar pattern to NASDAQ.
*   **NASDAQ:**
    *   Made a lower low when the S&P was resisting going lower around 10:00 AM.
    *   Resisted a lower low at 10 AM when compared to the S&P.
*   **Divergence:** This divergence (no indicators) is based on inter-market relationships, which I call **SMT (Smart Money Technique/Tool).**
*   **Bias:** I already had a bullish bias; no short trades lined up with the model.

#### Price Action Analysis

*   **Framework:** Looking at the price action, you can see a rally that breaks a short-term low and a fair value gap, then trades up into it and breaks down.
*   However, this doesn't fit the short criteria because the displacement leg would require a fair value gap above 50% of the high and low, which we don't have.
*   The market creates a run on sell stops and retraces back down into a fair value gap.
*   I was trying to get my recording software (**Camtasia Studio**) open at this time and missed the initial entry. It does not open sometimes and I have to close it and restart. All the while the candle was forming and I wanted to see it return into the fair value gap.

#### Website Address Watermark

*   I use my Camtasia recording software to add my website address as a watermark. TradingView doesn't do that. It is just an application that I can overlay as a text call out.
*   When I'm recording, it's a blank chart, and I add the watermark during editing.
*   Website address is [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkokVv0owSE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkokVv0owSE)

#### Entry & Close Proximity Entries

*   I got in on this candle.
*   The NASDAQ was sloppier here compared to the more structured S&P 500. The fair value gap in the S&P wicked down into the candle.
*   I wanted to get close to the fair value gap without it running too far away.
*   Close Proximity Entries: You might not get precise entries or fumble with your order entry, like what happened to me while trying to record. It’s where you miss the initial entry.
*   What do you do when you miss the ideal entry? As long as you're getting in really close or in close proximity, there's nothing wrong with it.
*   The idea is to get in where our model suggests.

#### Market Structure Shift

*   The market is trading lower but failing to make a lower low like NASDAQ, which gives me the inclination that it is probably not going to be taken out because we're bullish.
*   After the market rallies, we have a short-term shift in market structure that trades back down into the fair value gap.
*   There were multiple opportunities to get in this area (inside or in close proximity to the fair value gap) with eight different candles.
*   When the market starts to rally, there's another indication that the market structure has shifted again, bullish, with these highs taken out.
*   There was a small fair value gap there and I added more.

#### Trade Execution & Result

*   The limit order filled. I only had one and three-quarters handles (seven ticks) of heat against me on this little candle before it started running in my favor.
*   I took the full pool off here but didn’t get the highest high. I was a little disappointed in that regard.
*   Trading View allows for a complete look at the business.

#### Trading View: Live Market Execution

*   On TradingView, you can see the time of this recording and the live market activity.
*   The market trades lower, creates that short-term run, rallies breaking market structure to the upside, trades into the fair value gap, the secondary fair value gap, and runs up into the liquidity above.
*   **Executions:**
    *   Entry 1: 3994.5 (Low: 3994.5) - Less than two handles of heat.
    *   Entry 2: 3994.5 (Low: 3993.25) - Less than one handle of heat.
    *   Exit: 4022.5.
*   Very tight placement. It was not entering in the fair value gap, but rather in close proximity to it.
*   The underlying idea was that it was going down in here to go higher, retrace into that to go higher.
*   No short positions were taken.

#### NASDAQ Execution

*   On the NASDAQ, there were no executions today. All business was done in the S&P 500.

#### The Point of These Videos

*   When you see these videos, I’m trying to illustrate that I don’t need to defraud anyone. The things I’m teaching you, I think that you're seeing evidence that it works.
*   Hopefully, you guys have seen enough with this.

#### Compound Interest Calculation

Do the math, folks. In less than a week and a half, how much more would you see this compound if I did it for six more weeks or five weeks? Is it hard to imagine the things that I did on Twitter with MT4, not a rental MT4 server, literally pushing a button, putting the orders in, doing the whole business?

#### Demo Baller Statement

*   I know a lot of you have just discovered me and you're seeing people post stuff about how other traders or other mentors or other teachers they fake their positions.
*   I'm open about paper trading because it's compliance. I'm not legally allowed to give you trade advice, so I'm protected by my discussion in paper trading because you cannot make money with paper trades and you can't lose money with paper trades.
*   I've always said this from the beginning. I've dubbed myself the **Demo Baller**. I championed that meme because I want to make sure everyone knows that I'm not promising you profitability.
*   I don't dangle a carrot in front of you and say you're going to do what I'm doing here because you're not going to be able to replicate this; you're not.

#### Understanding the Demo

*   Don't be deceived by seeing me do this again, for like the fifth time, running up an account with Breakneck speed velocity.
*   This is just casually dealing in a tight range; when there's large ranges, I could have easily taken this over to a million dollars already. But it doesn't prove anything except for the fact that I can read price action. That's all I'm showcasing.
*   I'm not trying to say I'm the best; I'm not trying to say that you can't make money in other things. I'm just saying I know how to read these candlesticks.
*   I know what they're likely to do most of the time before they do it, not all the time. I take losing trades, but when it's really likely to work with the algorithm, I'll be dialed in.

#### Authenticity & Transparency

*   You can't fake what I'm doing. You can see me executing the trade, you can see me managing the trade, you can see the orders entering and filling. They pop up; they verify the whole thing.
*   No replay button up here. You can’t create that same scenario.

#### MT4 Allegations Closure

I'm hopefully satisfying this discussion that people like to bring up all the time about rented MT4 servers, because they couldn't wait to put that on me because they watched me do just like this, and I ran up to five million dollars in a little less than one and a half months.

I understand that doesn't seem possible. I understand that people that would be able to do what I'm doing could very easily go out there and defraud people. I'm telling you, it's demo. I'm not saying that I did that with real money. I'm just saying that I can read price action. I can see these patterns forming.

#### Past Behavior on MT4 Platforms

Even with these other folks out there with fake MT4 servers and MT4 screenshots of making money and all this other fake withdrawals on I made fun of all that stuff I trolled those people on Twitter.

#### Return to Twitter: New Intentions

Now I'm about to go back to Twitter. This time, I'm not going there with that intent. I'm ready should someone want to bring it, but I'm not there or going there for that reason.

*   The reason why I'm going to Twitter is I miss being able to do my small little vignettes where I would do recordings of me either taking a trade or reading price action and having some short little clip 40 seconds long or less of music in the background.
*   I miss doing that. Maybe it wasn't always your cup of tea for my music choice, but I have a very diverse palette for music and it's just one of those things I enjoy doing.
*   So, it might not be worth it for you to follow me on Twitter, or it might be. I don't know.

#### Conclusion

I kind of wanted to clear the air for the last time and show you all one more time where I don't need to do what fraud to do. Like I can I can see this stuff before it happens, and you can learn how to do this too. You can read it before it happens. You can see it. You can have faith that the things that you're learning here are rooted on Sound Logic. It's not randomness. It's not retail logic. These are things that are algorithmic, and I think today was a testimony to that.

Tomorrow's going to be very volatile. Be careful; do not try to trade tomorrow. You'll probably hurt yourself if you do, or don't listen to me and learn the lesson the hard way. Until next time, be safe.

# Market Analysis: A Bottom-Up Approach

## Introduction

"Alright folks, welcome back! Today, we're diving into a market analysis, starting from the micro and working our way up. We'll begin with the **one-minute chart** and gradually move to higher timeframes, offering a **bottom-up perspective**."

## One-Minute Chart Analysis

### Judas Point and Liquidity Sweeps

"Ahead of the **2 PM** Fed chairman's announcement, we observed a **'Judas Point'**.

*   The morning high was at **12535.5**
*   It fell one tick short of that high **(12535.75)**."

The market ran up after clearing relative equal highs, then broke lower (**no model short**). It then dropped below relative equal lows during the **New York lunch hour (12:00 PM - 1:00 PM)**.

"As I've explained in the mentorship, afternoon continuations often involve sweeping the lunch-time lows. That's what we witnessed here."

### Imbalance and Manipulation

"The market delved into an imbalance area, which I discussed on Twitter. It's important to note this imbalance was present, even though my chart initially didn't display it correctly."

*   "The market drops below the relative equal lows, signaling manipulation."
*   "Long holders were 'raked across the coals,' not permitted to profit on the run to 12553.25."
*   "Buy stops were triggered, trapping breakout traders and those using bull flag patterns."
*   "Long holders from the morning were also targeted, with their stop losses hit."
*   "The true objective was a draw on liquidity toward **12553.25.**"

### Long Squeeze and Target Liquidity

"We took out the New York lunch lows, and shorts were poised to be squeezed as the price surged higher into **12553.25** (a misprint in the original recording, but the intention was clear)."

*   "I initiated a long position with a 'really poor entry,' prioritizing a position below the relative equal lows. My stop was set accordingly (as you can see on my Twitter feed at **@Capital_I_AM_VTH_ICT**)."
*   "The recording captures my entry point below the lows, emphasizing it wasn't about finding resistance to short."
*   "The price then descended to an order block before rallying, reflecting the potential internal dialogue of those short from around 12530."
*   "I outlined the internal dialogue of those individuals that may be short from like twelve thousand five thirty and their stop would also be right here and I was kind of like saying what would you feel if you were short from up here would you feel safe? Certainly you would feel safe but I said watch how that changes and then all of a sudden it starts running up"

### Algorithm Execution

"We saw an order block, with multiple interactions, aiming for a fair value gap. Though it didn't fully materialize there."

"Around **3:00 PM**, the algorithms began spooling price in the direction of the liquidity, targeting that **12553.25** level. We hammered it at **12417.75**, just below the **12420** level, focusing on it because I missed the initial entry during the imbalance."

### Price Action Analysis

"The market traded back into the order block, delivering precisely with the fair value gap. Observe this elegant delivery, then a rally, a pause, and a further push higher. Consolidation occurred right below the anticipated target, followed by a surge to fulfill exits above **12553.25**."

## Five-Minute Chart Analysis

"On the five-minute chart, it might not be as immediately obvious, but we briefly surpassed the morning high before breaking down."

*   "The liquidity resting above acted as a trap, misleading retail traders into believing it was reliable resistance."
*   "Interestingly, my model didn't generate a setup this morning or this afternoon. Even though the market sold off, a setup wasn't triggered. It is important to note."
*   "This illustrates that when the market is truly aligned, these algorithmic principles might not appear in markets that aren't poised for delivery."
*   "While it's not foolproof, there are instances where the market sells off without a setup, only to create a genuine move in the opposite direction, where setups and fair value gaps become apparent."

"The market indeed traded down into the imbalance on the one-minute chart and rallied from there to the 12553 level."

## Fifteen-Minute Chart Analysis

"Moving to the 15-minute chart, an imbalance is evident, which price action also traded down into."

*   "There's an optimal trade entry here, aiming for the same high liquidity target of 12553.25."

## Sixteen-Minute Chart Analysis

"The market retraced into this area before surging. This was the area I mentioned a week or so ago on my YouTube community tab and we've now pushed into it."

*   "That **12553.25** level originated from clearing that area."
*   "I'm not suggesting a high has been formed to move lower, but the next upside target would be around **12624**."
*   "If we continue to run, we could revisit this area as well."

## Daily Chart Analysis

"Analysis of the daily chart shows relative equal highs.

*   Price ran up into that area."
*   "As discussed in a recent mentorship episode, this aligned with our daily bias."
*   "While there was a significant downward movement, followed by another, my focus remained on the 12553 level."
*   "This run was the one I favored, the true hunt."

## Conclusion

"Although only a paper trade, the hypothetical profit was around $5,000. This demonstrates the principles at work."

"This involves advanced concepts, but I've covered the general factors behind PM session trading: waiting for lunch consolidation, identifying lunch lows, waiting for a run, and then a continuation—all taught in this mentorship on this YouTube channel."

"Hopefully, you found this insightful. I'll be back on Thursday, Lord willing!"

# **S&P 500 June Contract 2022 Analysis: A Daily Chart Review**

## **Disclaimer and Scammer Alert**

All right folks, welcome back! This is going to be a short video on the **S&P 500 June contract 2022**. This is our daily chart.

Before I get into it, just let me remind you that:

*   I **do not use WhatsApp**.
*   I will **not** be in the comments section asking you to reach out to me. No "hit me up," "let's talk," or anything like that.
*   Those are **all scammers**.
*   I'm **never** going to ask you for money.
*   I'm **not** going to direct message you.
*   I'm **not** going to direct message you on Twitter.

All those people are just trying to scam you and pretend to be me. I'm not asking for your money. You're here to eat off my table for free, and I'm happy to do it. So just know that those accounts are not me. **Please report them and ignore them.**

## **Focus on Stock Indices and Forex Considerations**

We're going to look at this day here on the **S&P 500 daily chart**. Before we get into it, I'm going to bring your attention to the **16th of May** on that low. This morning on Twitter, I was not able to participate in the early session movement on the stock indices because I've been trying to do things to share with the audience that has been mainly following me because of forex.

I noticed a lot of you are starting to evaluate and complain that you want to see forex, and I understand that. But even my paid membership group has seen very little in terms of forex too. I'm pushing this asset class because this is where the volatility is.

**Key Takeaway:** Price is price. It doesn't make a difference. When forex starts moving around big again, trust me, index futures will get slower and quieter in comparison to forex.

Trust me when I tell you the currency markets will eventually, within the next 12 months or so, probably start having some pretty wild movement. But until then, we have to look for volatility where we can find it. Right now, it is in the **stock index market**.

So, if you're a hardliner or a purist and you don't want to see these types of moves in this type of market, I understand. But **learn from it because it works the same way in forex.** Just know that.

## **Dollar CAD Trade and Stock Indices Participation**

I mentioned on Twitter that I was in the **Dollar CAD** this morning. I went long on that one on its impact news at 8:30, and it was a snooze fest. It took forever just to move a little bit. Obviously, I shared that on the Twitter feed, so you can go and look at that again.

I mentioned I was going to grab a bite to eat, have some lunch, and then I would look to see if there's anything for the stock index market. I participated in this move I'm going to show you today, and I hinted at where the market was likely to go to.

## **Trade Call Disclaimer: Emphasizing Education, Not Spoon-Feeding**

Let me state this going forward, because I had Perry Mason over there on Twitter reach out to me saying that the bar has been lowered for calling out trades.

**I don't call out trades.** I'm not going to put you in a trade. I'm not going to give you an entry, a stop, or a target. I'm not going to do that. I don't spoon-feed. I don't do that with my paid group.

What I do is **I point to where the market's going to go**. I've already taught you how to get in. I've already taught you where to put a stop loss. I've already taught you how to put your limit orders in. I taught you all that. Now, the problem is you don't have the experience of knowing where it's going to likely go next.

## **Focus on May 16 Low as a Reference Point**

This morning, what I did was I drew everyone's attention to the **low on the 16th of May 2022**.

Now, if the market is above (and let's go into a lower timeframe chart) and we're in the market and we're up here, and I'm suggesting to everyone, think about this low over here on the 16th, what do you think I'm drawing your attention to while we're up here and I'm drawing your attention to this specific area, the lows of May 16, 2022? Do you think I'm referring to it as it should not come back down here?

Everyone should understand my style is **we're aiming for liquidity**. So, if it's up here and I'm pointing down here and taking your attention down there, I'm acting like a scout. You're the sniper in training, whether you realize it or not. Okay?

So, I'm trying to point you to where you should be aiming, and you have to do the work of scoping it up, pulling the trigger, and dealing with all that. Okay?

## **No Shortcuts and the Role of Personal Responsibility**

There's no shortcut to this. There's not going to be an ICT on Twitter or on YouTube that sits down in front of you and says, "Okay, everybody, are you ready? We're all going to buy right now. We're all going to put our stop-loss at the same place. We're all going to put our exit or the same place, and we're all going to ride these things, and this is going to be happy and that's it." I'm not going to do that. I never promised to do that. I'm not going to do a period in a story. No way.

**This is how I train my students. It works, folks. It does not work for lazy people.** Okay? I understand that some of you just want to be handheld, but that's not going to happen with me. I don't do it. I didn't do it when people paid me, and I'm not going to do it for free either.

You don't need me to hold your hand. If I point to where I think the market's going to go, it's your job to study and look for the opportunity. **The fair value gap is what you're going to be utilizing.**

Some of you are fixated on only looking for the setup at the opening. Well, what happens if you don't get a trade at the opening? Can't you use a fair value gap? You have to get involved with the move if it's going to go down to something like this. Yes, that's what I did today.

## **Trade Execution and Analysis**

Let me add the annotations in the form of showing you the executions, so you can see.

Here's where I entered:

*   **Entry Point:** Four contracts at **4007.75**, aiming for the **16th of May low**.
*   **Time Constraints:** I didn't have a whole lot of time to be babysitting this thing.
*   **Risk Management:** Late afternoon, this could have easily whipped up, did some kind of a retracement if I didn't kind of stop-loss trail down, and then even move lower.
*   **Key Idea:** Your attention was drawn to the **16th of May, the low on the 16th of May.**

### **15-Minute Timeframe Analysis**

Let's go into a 15-minute timeframe.

You can see up close, candle. What do you think that is right before we start to go lower? It's a **bearish order block**. Draw that out in time. It hits that order block on this candle here.

### **5-Minute Timeframe Analysis**

Dropping into a five-minute chart. What is this? Doesn't look like a fair value gap yet until you zoom in, huh? So, right in here, it's hitting it, overshoots it granted, but it's a lot of volatility right now. This candle is high. Your stop would be above there. Hold on to the position until it starts to break lower.

If you want to fine-tune it, this is the one I shared on Twitter in the recording. So, what I saw was this **fair value gap** here. It hit it, created what...what is this? What's this pattern here? What's these three candles here? It's a **swing high**.

So, as soon as this candle closed here, I'm going to go right here at this candle and just get in and go short trusting the fact that we've already had a **fair value gap**, we already went through it, we have it **swing high**, and it's bearish.

I'm looking for what? What am I looking for? I'm looking for a **run below this old low, which is May 16, 2022's low.**

Entering here and I'm riding it out with a stop here. Everything is reduced in terms of risk. As soon as we started to break lower here and started moving my favor aggressively, I moved my stop only because the volatility is so high right now. I just don't want to see it come back and knock me out. That's not fear; that's just sound money management. I'm not trying to take a losing trade.

Here is the entry again. It delivers on the downside.

*   **Partial Take Profit:** I took my first partial here, one off here, and in the limit order, you watched that fill on the little recording, the vignette that I shared on Twitter.
*   **Market Behavior:** Ultimately, we started going a little bit sideways going into the beginning of lunch in New York.
*   **Lunch Time Consolidation:** Here's your typical lunchtime consolidation.
*   **Stop Hunt:** What's this? Stop ahead of lunch. Very valuable. It's almost like it knows what it wants to do, huh?
*   **Further Price Action:** Breaks lower, consolidation again, trades lower, consolidation bumps to stops here. What's this? Oh, this ICT just makes it so complicated, hits it, sells off, sell-side here consolidates one more time and trades and meets the low of the day, I think when this one huh? Closed candle though at **3910**. Not bad.

## **Summary of Trading Activity**

So, that is what I did today. I did not participate in the afternoon session post-New York lunch. This is all I had to share today, right there, there, there, and there.

That's going to be it for today. Hope you enjoyed this and found it insightful. Until I talk to you tomorrow, be safe.

## Commentary on Market Analysis via Twitter: A Detailed Breakdown

**Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzoMJQlEv5M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzoMJQlEv5M)

This is a commentary on the market analysis shared via Twitter, walking viewers through the thought process and reasoning behind the day's trading decisions. You're encouraged to review the Twitter feed for the full, real-time account of the analysis. The timestamps on the tweets provide verification of the calls and predictions that were made. It was an intense day of taking Twitter followers through the "meat grinder," detailing every minor fluctuation and explaining expected movements to set up the 3-4 PM short. The highlights discussed here are detailed in the tweets.

### Understanding the "Outside Day"

*   **Definition:** The day began with an "outside day" formation. An **outside day** is defined as a trading day where the high is higher than the previous day's high, and the low is lower than the previous day's low, closing down.

*   **Significance:** This price action formation, where the market trades down to an old low but falls short, often leads to a "double bottom" scenario.

*   **Expectation:** While a run through the old low may seem likely, a failure to do so often results in a choppy day, particularly with an outside day and a down close.

### Hourly Chart Analysis

The hourly chart provides a closer look at the day's price action.

*   **Key Level:** A crucial level was identified at **3933.25**, mentioned repeatedly throughout the day's tweets.

*   **Anticipating Choppiness:** Due to the choppy nature of the trading day, analysis was done on how to anticipate it and what to look for.

### Five-Minute Chart Breakdown

A detailed examination of the five-minute chart reveals critical insights.

*   **3933.25 Level:** This level was highlighted in the tweets, confirming its importance.
*   **Low at 3872.25:** This marks a significant low point.
*   **Old Low (Daily Chart):** The old low on the daily chart, which was not traded through, sits at **3855**.
*   **Missed Target:** The market fell just short of this level, reaching **3856** (one handle short), before reversing and trading higher.

### Market Opportunities and "50/50 Probability"

*   **Deceptive Setups:** Many times, the market presents opportunities that appear likely to form a setup, but they do not materialize.

*   **Fair Value Gap:** The market initially worked lower, creating a small fair value gap. After bumping into that, it traded lower again.

*   **50/50 Scenario:** As the market traded around this area, there was a "50/50 probability" – an equal chance of moving higher or lower. This scenario arises when the market starts trading back into the middle of the range.

*   **Failed Imbalance:** The fair value gap *should* have prompted a more significant move lower to take out the short-term low.

*   **Targeting Liquidity:** Instead, the market rallied towards relative equal highs, with an early prediction for a move to **3933.25**.

*   **Longer-Term Bias:** The longer-term bias still favored the **3855** level for sell-side liquidity, acknowledging the need to assess each trade idea based on current dealing ranges.

### Dealing Ranges and Market Dynamics

*   **Defining a Dealing Range:** The term "dealing range" refers to a range from a high to a low. For example, from this high down to that low.

*   **Tradable Opportunities:** Trading up into an imbalance and down to a short-term low can create a tradable opportunity, but the market became unclear after that, resulting in choppy price action.

*   **Running Stops:** The price went up to **3933.25**, cleared relative equal highs, broke down, and traded back down into the range.

### The 3-4 PM Setup: A Key Prediction

The real setup, based on the algorithm and specific framework, was predicted to occur between 3:00 PM and 4:00 PM New York local time.

*   **Middle of the Daily Range:** Tweets emphasized studying the middle of the daily range, between the high and the low.

*   **Buy-Side Liquidity:** The market would run up to take out buy stops, squeezing shorts and inducing longs, building sell-side liquidity below the lows to protect long positions.

*   **Time-Specific Entry:** A specific time window (3-4 PM) was given for a setup based on a run above for buy-side liquidity, followed by a pullback into the range.

### Minute Chart: Execution and Results

*   **Rally and Short:** The market rallied above, hit buy-side liquidity, and smart money used that to go short. The breakdown and logic were outlined beforehand, with the framework and narrative provided.

*   **Trade Details:**

    *   Sold short at **3940.75**.
    *   Took profits on four contracts at **3908.75** (middle of the range).
    *   A limit order remains at **3855**, with a position still in play.

*   **Reaction to Negativity:** Response to those who try to stir up controversy by making negative remarks. Focus is placed on those who are diligently learning.

### Days of Choppiness and Consolidation

*   **Purposeful Guidance:** The purpose was to guide people through their own charts and encourage critical thinking.

*   **Setup Outline:** The plan was for the market to run buy stops and then pull back to the middle of the range.

*   **Difficult Trading:** This kind of price action is difficult to trade within, as it can stop traders out and go nowhere.

*   **Consolidation Days:** On consolidation days, the market creates an initial range and stays within it until the afternoon.

*   **Algorithm's Role:** Between 3-4 PM (formerly the bond close), the algorithm often pushes outside the daily range.

*   **Liquidity Grab:** Before 3 PM, the market rallied up for buy-side liquidity.

*   **Smart Money:** Traders would view this as a breakout, attracting those that smart money would exploit.

### Sharing the Experience: Teaching and Trading Simultaneously

*   **Divided Attention:** While simultaneously working with his son, outlining market analysis and sending out tweets.

*   **Son's Live Trading:** His son was executing live trades on a linked account, growing from $6,000 to $10,000 in a week.

*   **Validation:** To those who claim the strategies don't work, the specifics of the day's trade were provided, with the market going exactly where it was predicted to go.

### Future Engagement and Tools

*   **Twitter Spaces:** There's an application on Twitter ("Spaces") that allows audio conversations, similar to an ICT squawk box. This could be used to discuss market observations (not signals).

*   **Reviewing The Day:** The detailed move outlined early in the day involved driving the market higher to squeeze short traders.

### Liquidity and Stop Runs: Understanding the Logic

*   **Buy-Side Liquidity:** Running buy orders resting above were protecting short positions and acting as stop-loss orders.

*   **Liquidity Wave:** When the market trades above, these buy stops become a rush of liquidity.

*   **Range-Bound Trade:** The market should gravitate back to the midpoint of the day's range.

*   **Algorithm's Move:** The algorithm may move outside the bounds of the daily range between 3-4 PM, taking out longs and squeezing shorts.

*   **Calling the Trade:** A short position was taken in front of 20,000 people and the trade was called correctly, leading to profits.

### Looking Ahead: Future Sessions and Encouragement

*   **Future Sessions:** There will be another session to share some insights, but will not last all day.

*   **Son's Success:** Praise for his son's success in trading and learning.

*   **Continuing on Twitter:** Future engagement on Twitter.

*   **Final Remarks:** Be safe!

# **Video Analysis of ES Opening Price and Market Dynamics**

**Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8flQP5jy-Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8flQP5jy-Q)

## **I. Introduction: Setting the Stage**

*   Welcome back to the showing off stuff!
*   Today, the focus is on analyzing the **opening price of ES (E-mini S&P 500 futures contract)**.
*   The analysis stems from observations made on Twitter regarding an **old high**, linked to a gap from the previous night's session (6 PM local time).

## **II. Initial Price Action and Observations**

*   The market drifted lower after the gap, followed by a small rally exhibiting **SMT (Smart Money Technique) divergence**.
*   **Relative Equal Highs** were formed before a breakdown.
*   A **fair value gap** was identified and discussed live on a morning stream.
*   The market ran out the **sell-side liquidity** and explored the **opening gap from the prior Sunday**.

## **III. Detailed Chart Analysis and Key Levels**

### **A. Initial Market Movements:**

*   Price traded below the sell-side and into the **Sunday gap opening**.
*   It moved through the Sunday gap and down to another **fair value gap**, which it then hit.
*   The market rallied, taking out a **short-term high**, and retraced back into another **order block**.

### **B. Order Block Analysis (Five-Minute Chart):**

*   The five-minute chart reveals a cleaner view of the **order block**.
*   The market worked off this order block.
*   The market rallied to the level mentioned on Twitter earlier that morning.

### **C. Fair Value Gap Precision (Five-Minute Chart Example):**

*   A **fair value gap** was given live, demonstrating precise price delivery.
*   **Example:** The low on one candle was at **3926.75**. The subsequent candle traded right back up to **3926.75**.
*   This illustrates perfect price delivery.

## **IV. The Origin and Longevity of the Techniques**

*   While the speaker is known for demonstrating these techniques in the Forex market, they originated with **index futures and bonds**.
*   These tools have been used since the **1990s**.
*   The speaker emphasizes that these methods have been "under my control, my ownership" for about three decades.

## **V. Addressing Trade Signal Requests**

*   There have been numerous requests for **trade signals** and the establishment of a paid service or trading room.
*   **The speaker emphatically declines all such requests.**
    *   "I don't want to be in another paid service type thing. Okay? I'm sick of it. I don't want to deal with that no more."
*   The speaker states they can make enough money trading personally and doesn't need additional income streams.
*   The speaker's motivation is teaching and sharing knowledge, not generating income from a paid service.
*   The speaker likes doing it and appreciates the audience likes receiving the knowledge.

## **VI. Market Behavior After Fair Value Gap Hit**

*   After hitting the fair value gap, the market broke lower.
*   It later returned up into that range, though not precisely to the fair value gap itself.
*   A small imbalance was identified.

## **VII. Sunday Gap as Support and Resistance**

*   The market traded down into the **Sunday gap**.
*   The lower end of the gap was identified as a level to watch.
*   If the market went below the gap and came back up, it would likely act as resistance. This is exactly what happened.

## **VIII. Further Price Action and Key Levels**

*   Lower time frame analysis confirmed the above observations.
*   The market dropped lower, hitting an older fair value gap.
*   Consolidation occurred, followed by a typical lunch hour retracement back to the **opening range**.
*   A small swing low broke, leading to a rebound.

## **IX. Sunday Gap Continues to Act as Resistance**

*   The market revisited the **Sunday gap opening**, which acted as **resistance**.
*   It then traded lower into an **order block**.
*   Accumulation followed, with the market rallying back above the Sunday gap level.

## **X. Obnoxious Emphasis of Sunday's Levels**

*   The speaker deliberately makes the Sunday levels very obvious.
*   The goal is to illustrate the speaker's thought process while watching price action.
*   After going above the gap opening, the market traded back down into it.
*   The market rallied from the gap and fell short of relative equal highs, retracing back to the **gap opening again** (now at a discount low).
*   A fair value gap led to a rally to the **3952.75** level.

## **XI. Morning vs. Afternoon Market Conditions**

*   The morning market was described as "sloppy" because it wasn't giving you a whole lot to work with.
*   The afternoon market was much better.
*   **Sloppy conditions:**
    *   Limited options for trades.
    *   Required precise knowledge of what to look for.

## **XII. Targetting Specific Levels**

*   A follower on Twitter asked about the **3953** level (rounded up one quarter point).
*   The high came in at **3954.5**, missing the target by 1.5 handles.
*   The speaker was more interested in the run to that level than in the Sunday gap opening or London open lows.

## **XIII. Dynamic Support and Resistance - "Blasphemy!"**

*   The speaker addresses potential criticism for discussing "retail" concepts like **dynamic support and resistance**.
*   The speaker argues that the Sunday gap opening can be treated as a dynamic price level.
*   When the price is above the gap, look for it to act as **support**. When below, look for **resistance**.
*   Find a swing high and look for it to run about there and trade down into the Sunday gap.

## **XIV. Consolidation and Choppy Market Conditions**

*   The speaker notes that in weeks with consolidation (e.g., due to FOMC), markets become choppy and range-bound.
*   These conditions lack the clean, one-way directional moves.
*   Specific strategies are needed to trade effectively in these environments.

## **XV. Lower Timeframe Analysis (Two-Minute Chart)**

*   A fair value gap was identified, with the speaker expressing a desire to see it stay open.
*   The speaker emphasizes that these live sessions are time-consuming and distracting.

## **XVI. Addressing Co-dependency and Negative Feedback**

*   The speaker explicitly states that the live sessions are **not** intended to create co-dependency or provide specific trade signals.
*   The purpose is to demonstrate how to read the market and identify opportunities independently.

## **XVII. Outlook**

*   The speaker thinks they are going to be drawing up into this gap.
*   The speaker believes the initial gap area will not be left open indefinitely.
*   The speaker wants to draw attention to missing data here.
*   The likely move will be to trade back up into that gap.
*   Target price is the low on that candle.
*   The expectation is not for perfect price action, just for study material.
*   Going above the current area means a deeper run is likely on the daily.
*   High likelihood of running that high.
*   Another order block is present at 4000.

## **XVIII. Clarifying Fibonacci Usage (Responding to Hannah's Analysis)**

*   The speaker addresses a specific point regarding Fibonacci usage, prompted by Hannah's YouTube channel analysis.
*   The speaker clarifies that if the price is going higher, then the dealing range low to high will be anchored there.
*   **Correct Method:** If looking for a long, draw the Fibonacci from the low up to the high. Wait for a retracement to below 50% (a discount).

*   **Incorrect Method:** Do not measure a price leg from high to low when trying to go long.
*   The aim is to use impulsive price swings in the direction of the intended trade.
*   Look for retracements below 50% and/or into a fair value gap.
*   The speaker approves of the interactive study Hannah is doing.

## **XIX. Closing Remarks**

*   The speaker expresses appreciation for Hannah's analysis and overall engagement from the audience.
*   The speaker hopes the lesson has been insightful.
*   The speaker anticipates being back on Thursday.
*   Closing salutations to the audience to be safe.

## Market Analysis: E-Mini S&P 500 - Detailed Breakdown

### **Introduction**

Alright folks, welcome back. Lord willing, I'll be back next Tuesday after the holiday weekend. Let's dive into an analysis of the E-Mini S&P daily chart, detailing the recent price action and future expectations.

### **Daily Chart Overview**

*   We've seen a **nice delivery to the upside**, and this will likely draw price action into the bearish order block area.
*   Note that today's range traded up into this **up-close candle**, without taking out the high.
*   **Next area to watch:** The unmet high of the up-close candle

### **Order Block Sensitivity**

When using a candle as an order block, pay attention to three sensitive areas:

1.  The low
2.  The open
3.  The middle of the range

*   If the market trades up into the middle point of the candle, this is what I call the **"mean threshold."**
*   **Key observation:** The mean threshold was taken today, which bodes well for a continuation to take out the short-term high.

### **Fibonacci Analysis and Lower Timeframe Perspective**

*   If you take your Fib and you run it across this candle to 50 level...
*   **50 Minute Timeframe Analysis:**
    *   Yesterday's trading turned up into a small area down to its low, which I mentioned was a likely candidate for upside.
    *   Relative equal highs present.
    *   Price traded back down into a fair value gap and optimal trade entry.
    *   A rally occurs, taking out buy-side liquidity above a short-term high (not visible on *my* chart, but check yours on the 15-minute timeframe).
    *   Consolidation occurred ahead of today's session.
*   **Midnight Crossover (New York Time):**
    *   A small "Judas Swing" occurs: price drops down to increase the low of the day, and then rallies.
    *   Relative equal highs are left behind, and the intraday high remains intact.
    *   Another drop and rally, followed by a small retracement.
    *   A shallow run above 4000 occurred.
    *   On a lower timeframe, I used this retracement to highlight a run to 4000, as I gave you guys 4000 as my objective.
*   **Result:** The 4000 target was hit, and then price pressed deeper into the order block on the daily chart, creating this whole run.
*   I'm not going into the details about that *here*, but just know that we were trading up to this level, failed to reach the same level, and then consolidated right below that daily bearish order block.
*   The low of the candle creates that daily bearish order block, and the opening is a bit higher (I think it's 4002, but don't quote me on that; check your own chart).

### **Five-Minute Candle Analysis**

*   Let's look at the lower timeframes:

    *   This run (from here to here) is part of this price leg.
    *   Notice how this candle's high to this candle's low (that range) has one single pass, whereas this one has one, two.
    *   Note the low, high, small retracement, and then a second-level run.
    *   I identified **two stages** to this delivery.
    *   **I'm using the most recent one as my dealing range:** The short-term low to the short-term high.
*   I ran a Fib on that dealing range and showed this in a short vignette I posted on my Twitter.
    *   **My Twitter Handle:** **@I_Am_The_ICT** (that's @ symbol, capital I underscore A M underscore T-H-E underscore I-C-T).
    *   **Important Note:** There are a lot of people over there pretending to be me. Some have even been asking for money. I AM NOT ASKING YOU FOR MONEY, and I will NEVER DM you. If it isn't being posted publicly on Twitter, it isn't me!
*   **Trading Range Analysis:**
    *   *Low to High measured*: 50% is equilibrium.
    *   *Expectation*: I want to see price drop down into the discount area.
    *   *Focus*: This small area down here, in particular the Fair Value Gap

### **Addressing Questions and Clarifications**

*   From this run here to here...
*   **Addressing Anticipation vs. Model:** I know some of you were bringing up today on Twitter, what about the times I said for the model, "teaching you something that is outside the model is the reason why you're not going to anticipate or see that typical setup?" That's the whole point of why I did it today.
*   **Personal Reasons**: I have a lot of personal things to take care of and administrative work in my private group.
*   The market rallies, drops down in the fair value gap above the 4000 level.
*   **8:30 AM Candle:** This is the 8:30 candle, and you can watch when it trades right into that fair value gap, it rallies again. It drops back down in, and then at 9:30, this candle here explodes to the upside and starts digging deeper.
*   It traded up into almost the 4074 level.
*   **Outlook:** We'll be looking for a continuation of the upside, with 4095-4100 as the next consideration.

### **Deeper Dive into the Price Action**

I want to take you into the price action down in here and give you more details as to why I was willing to take something a little bit earlier today.

### **NASDAQ June Contract (2022) Comparison**

*   If you plot the NASDAQ June contract for 2022.
*   **Using TradingView:** On the compare chart on TradingView. If you go up into your TradingView platform, you'll see a little plus symbol up here. If you click on that, it'll give you an opportunity to add another instrument, and you add this symbol here: **NQM2022**.
*   It'll plot a line chart, but it's usually going to be applied on the close (as a default).
*   **Change the setting:** Change that in the settings by just right-clicking over here or highlighting over top of it. It'll give you like a little gear or something, click on that, and change the settings to...
*   ...plotting on the low, because you're comparing lows.
*   **SMT Divergence:**
    *   As you can see, the NASDAQ went *lower* here, whereas the S&P *failed* to go lower. That's an **SMT divergence (Smart Money Technique).**
    *   This indicates accumulation in the S&P, while the NASDAQ is taking out liquidity.
*   **Correlation Caution:**
    *   There's a cracking correlation between the two; usually, they move in tandem, but at certain times (like 8:30, 9:30, and news events), they'll create this divergence.
    *   If you have a bias, it's helpful, but if you don't know where it's going, you're going to encounter what would look like SMT divergence, and then it disappears as they start moving in concert with one another.
    *   That's why I always teach: know what it's reaching for!
*   **My Bias and Trade Execution:**
    *   The bias has been bullish, and for my framework and setup, because I gave you 4000 and I had very little time to work with anything this morning, I just hurried up and saw the chart.
    *   I missed the actual ideal entry; I just used a close proximity entry with an order block.

### **Fair Value Gap and Market Dynamics**

*   If you look at the relationship of that fair value gap dropping back down in higher low than that of 830 versus the lower low made in Nasdaq, this is a stop out. This is accumulation of longs. This is going to be the telltale sign that it's going to go higher.
*   If you look at what we did on 830, it already snapped down into this gap and it's not likely to go lower than that. There's no need to.
*   **Compression Analogy:** It's being compressed, basically like a spring...or like a bomb, really. I hate to say it so crude, but that's what it is.
*   **Daily Order Block Target:** It's like waiting, and then all of a sudden it explodes. It's waiting just below that daily bearish order block and it's digging up into that thing at range on that up-close candle on the daily chart.
*   It's climbing up up up up, and we watch to see if it gets to the main threshold, which is half of that fair shoulder block or up-close candle on the daily chart.
*   **Note:** I was making rappers to be in the video.
*   Again, we can see zoomed-in price breaks back down into the fair value gap after trading through the order block. This is a 15-minute timeframe order block.
*   Then it rallies inside this little area. There's one small little pullback into a fair value gap on a one-minute chart (I'll leave that for you to go into and study).

### **Hourly Chart and Market Structure**

Here is the hourly chart. I want to give you like a market structure perspective.
*   *Likely Target:* Here's where it's likely to be drawn to next.
*   *Rebalancing:* All of this movement down here, we completely rebalanced all that.
*   *Consolidation:* We have consolidated here ahead of running all the way up into this area here.

    *   *Fair Value Gap Highlighted:* Here is the fair value gap I had drawn on the lower timeframe chart just a moment ago before we move back up to an hour chart.

### **Recap of Market Flow**

Notice what was happening:

1.  Low
2.  Retrace down into this low-to-high discount fair value gap
3.  Rallies
4.  Dealing range low/dealing range high
5.  Retraces down into discount
6.  Rallies
7.  Dealing range low/dealing range high
8.  Discount fair value gap order block
9.  Rally
10. Consolidate
11. We rally
12. Come back down into the smaller time frame fair value gaps and SMT diversions
13. Rallies and keeps pressing higher

### **Questions and Reflections**

*   My question to you is:
    *   How many of you first didn't listen to me when I said don't trade?
    *   Did you try to sell short, when the bias has been bullish?
*   **Market Expectation:** It's likely to do what? Keep digging higher! We try not to pick tops.
*   **Observation:** Look what this has done. We've had a low, a lower low, a sudden dramatic low that we came back up.
*   **Market Structure Shift:** Had a shift in market structure here.
*   **Retracement:** Then we retreated back down to this imbalance.
*   **Market Behavior:** So we're seeing the market do what? Keep going higher.
*   **Algorithm Behavior:** Keep going higher, picking up discount levels each time the algorithm is picking up more accumulated longs to press deeper into all of this range and likely trade into the buy-side liquidity here.
*   You have to know what you're looking for (narrative and bias).
*   **Shorting Considerations:** Also, what in this area or over here would constitute a short?
*   **Resistance:** Because we have all this range in here that it's not likely to go up to go straight all the way through all this stuff. That's a high resistance liquidity run.
*   **Likelihood:** Not that it can't happen, but it's likely not to form or pan out.
*   **Supporting Evidence:** Because we had so many supporting ideas in here, down-closed candles are supporting price. It's just finding underlying order flow that is bullish.
*   **Likely Scenario:** So it's likely to go up just to keep going higher, *not* go up to go down.
*   **Bearish Scenario Needs:** Because to go up to go down, we have all of these ranges that we would have to pierce and break, and that requires a lot of...well...intent, not selling pressure.
*   **Daily Chart Intent:** And the intent is to send this thing higher on the daily chart, which is why I took your attention to that initial gap on the daily chart.
*   **Range Expansion Reasoning:** So if you found this one insightful, hopefully you learned why today the range expansion took place and why it was *not* a short; we've been bullish, we've been looking for prices to go higher.

### **Reiterating the 4000 Target**

Just for clarity, let me go back up: 4000 was my objective only because I mentioned 4000 during the commentaries this week. So, when I was talking to you in lectures, I called this level. So I wanted to give you a point of entry and then target hitting it, and that was the whole point of me showing you a little vignette on Twitter today, showing you what I was looking for, how to frame a trade, how to set it up and you engage it because it was setting up this trade here.

### **Pre-7 AM Runs and SMT Divergence**

Just for your notes, because it gave a nice run here earlier before seven o'clock in the morning, that means we're probably going to have a deep retracement and look for an ideal scenario like we outlined with the SMT divergence.

*   **SMT Timing:** SMT usually will occur around a 9:30 time period when there has already been a nice early run before seven o'clock or at seven o'clock. We got real close to seven o'clock here.
*   **I'm Not Limited:** But I'm not limited to this model. I know some of you were questioning (with pointed remarks on Twitter), what are we doing here? Why are we not using the time frame that's used for the model?
*   **Delivery Proof:** I'm showing you again just proof that these things deliver as I teach them.
*   **My Teaching Scope:** Now, I have not only taught what I've revealed on YouTube; I have lots of students, I have students in my paid group, I have casual people that come through and watch one video or two videos, and I want them to see things that's being taught from my library of concepts.
*   **Early Setup Insight:** So if I can see this setup early in the day, before the seven o'clock in the morning, to me it gives me insight. It gives me an expectation around what the 9:30 opening is going to be like.
*   **SMT Potential:** So if I get an early run like this, my first thought is I need to go to SMT later on at 9:30, because it's probably going to require some kind of cracking correlation to set up the next leg (if it's going to have one).

### **Holiday Weekend Trading Caution**

*   It's Thursday, tomorrow's Friday.
*   *Weekend Disclaimer*: We're going to go into a holiday weekend.
*   I will not be trading tomorrow; I will not be trading on Monday.
*   **Private Group Content:** I'm going to be doing one video for my private group tomorrow, and it's probably going to be an early video, not so much a commentary for price action, because it's a weekend and Memorial Day is on Monday, so the volume is probably going to be light on Friday.
*   **Trading Advice:** So if you're going to be trading, you study in the morning session, leave the afternoon to in.
*   **Gambler's Volume:** The Gambler's volume just probably won't be on your side in the afternoon. Everybody's going to be going away for a long weekend.
*   **Take Monday Off:** And don't trade on Monday; take the day off, enjoy it, have hot dogs, hamburgers, relax. Do what you got to do to be a family person. I'm going to be doing the theme.

### **Conclusion**

And until I talk to you, lord willing, next Tuesday, enjoy your weekend and your holiday. Be safe.

# ICT Mentorship for YouTube 2022 - Episode 37 Analysis

**Video URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuZurY0ghDI

## E-mini S&P June Contract 2020 - Daily Chart Analysis

*   **Fair Value Gap & Breaker:** The market has worked inside a fair value gap which also acts as a breaker.
    *   **Breaker Definition:** A breaker is defined as a low, a high, and then another low (or vice versa). Identify the high (or low) in between, and extend it out in time.
    *   The market trades down into that breaker.
*   **Market Action:**
    *   Came down, filled the fair value gap, and is now starting to rally.
    *   Next buyside liquidity is the short-term high.
    *   Potential acceleration from the upside towards relative equal highs and another fair value gap.
*   **Bias for Students:**
    *   When the market moves from a low and starts trading higher, creating a swing low, it's easy to assume it wants to come back up to the high.
    *   Each day (with one exception) has been bullish.
    *   Bias is expected to be bullish until that high is taken out.
    *   Retracement is logical after a fair value gap is created.
    *   The market trades down, fills the gap, tests it once more, and rallies.

## Non-Farm Payroll Friday - Cautionary Advice

*   **Avoid Speculation:** Non-Farm Payroll Friday is a day the speaker does **NOT** advise speculating on.
*   **Reasoning:**
    *   The goal is to learn how to read price action.
    *   Non-Farm Payroll price action can be volatile, choppy, or a "dud".
    *   Lack of experience can lead to getting hurt by volatility.
    *   **DON'T** gamble with live money while learning.
*   **Guidance:** Months from now, if paper and demo trading are consistently successful, the decision to go live is yours, not instigated by the speaker.
*   **Study, Don't Trade:** Study Non-Farm Payroll Friday, but **DO NOT** trade.
    *   Determine what side of liquidity the market will reach for before the 8:30 news release.
    *   Observe the market action on one and five-minute charts.
    *   It's an "amazing study" for liquidity purposes only.
    *   To the untrained eye, moves can appear random.
    *   Sometimes the taught patterns materialize and pan out, but not always.
*   **Avoidance of FOMC & Non-Farm Payroll Weeks:** due to inexperience and potential for quick losses.

## Mentorship Philosophy

*   **Responsibility:** The speaker tries to be a responsible mentor and protect students from themselves.
*   **Trading Cut-Off:** Students are taught to stop trading by the New York session on Wednesday.
*   **Observation Only:** If profitable by Wednesday, stop trading for the rest of the week and only observe price action.
*   **Reasoning:** Challenging market profiles on Thursday and Friday of Non-Farm Payroll weeks can be choppy and lose precision.
*   **Focus on Advantages:** Focus on days without disadvantages.
*   **Mindset:** Promote a "super mindset" and respect the measure of risk.

## Key Levels

*   **Be mindful of the levels:** The two blue lines (fair value gap) and the lighter red line (short-term high).
*   These levels are not visible on lower timeframes.

## Hourly Chart E-mini S&P Analysis

*   Market trades down to the discount low of the fair value gap.
*   **Important Note:** Levels are *not* drawn based on hourly support/resistance. They are the same levels from the daily chart transposed.
*   **Market Action:**
    *   Wednesday: Market hits fair value gap low.
    *   Consolidation, then one more drop to the fair value gap.
    *   "Mad dash" to take out the short-term high.
    *   Bullish shift in market structure after taking out the short-term high and relative equal highs.
    *   Gravitating towards a run on the buyside.
*   **Disclaimer:** The speaker could be wrong; it doesn't need to happen tomorrow. This is simply an expectation.
*   **Study Point:** A small fair value gap exists, and the market might drop into it before going up.

## 15 Minute Time Frame Analysis

*   Markup for the short-term high on Wednesday's trading.
*   Market hits the fair value gap low on the daily chart.
*   Consolidation, then rally.
*   The speaker initially aimed to capture a run to take out the buyside, but it was "chopped up."
*   Realized it wasn't trying to rally and might try to take it once more below the New York midnight opening.

## ICT Power 3 (Accumulation, Manipulation, Distribution)

*   **Day Formation (Example):**
    *   Open.
    *   Consolidation.
    *   Rally.
    *   Drop into the fair value gap low on the daily chart.
    *   Bounce.
    *   Rally.
    *   Take out the short-term high.
    *   Continued Rally.
    *   Close.
*   **ICT Power 3 Application:** The mentioned formation of price action is the ICT Power 3 Pattern, Accumulating, Manipulating and Distributing.
    *Opening to create the low of the day and then rally.
*   **Lower Timeframe Perspective:** Easy to understand on a daily chart, but easy to get lost in candlesticks and volatility on lower timeframes.
*   **Noise vs. Structure:** What appears as "noise" to the uninitiated is just the daily chart pattern represented on a smaller interval.
*   **Importance of Context:** Losing context of key levels leads to misunderstanding.
*   **Example:** The Market drops down to the higher timeframe key level, which is the fair value gap low and the Market can Rally Higher.
*   **Short Trade Example:** The Speaker went short and covered inside the candle when dipping below the short term low.
*   **Precision Drops:** These days cause a precipitous drop in precision.
*   **Trading Strategy:** Avoid areas/arenas with built-in disadvantages.
*   **Leverage Advantages:** Trade when conditions are favorable based on proven walk-forward real trading results.
*   **Self-Awareness:** Recognize times of the month where trading should be avoided or expectations lowered.

## Mentorship and Discipline

*   **30 Years of Experience:** The speaker has learned to trust this over 30 years of experience.
*   **Press Upon Students:** The Speaker presses upon his students to stop trading on Wednesday by the New York session.
*   **Benefit of Discipline:** Even when weeks are bad, psychological and emotional rewards come from disciplined non-trading.
*   **Twitter Example:** Those who ignored the advice to avoid trading regretted it.
*   **Goal of Lessons:** To spare students from painful lessons learned by experience.

## Afternoon Setup Example - Twitter

*   **Speaker's Afternoon Activities:** The Speaker was shopping for some things that I need for the Summer, which took his attention away from being down here.
*   **Twitter Post:** Once back at the screens and seeing the market dropping to an area, the Speaker tweeted, asking followers to find the five-minute fair value gap above price.
*   **Expectation:** Expecting a move up into that area in the PM session (lunch and after).
*   **Implicit Objective:** If the market gets above, the next logical draw is the high.
*   **Twitter Information:**
    *   Handle: `@capitalAM_THE_ICT` (I am the Inner Circle Trader)
    *   Access: Tweets are not protected and can be viewed without joining Twitter at `twitter.com/capitalAM_THE_ICT`
*   **Tweet Details:**
    *   Time: 11:37 AM Eastern Time, June 2nd.
    *   Question: Locate the fair value gap above market price on the E-mini S&P five-minute chart.
    *   Chart Shared
*   **Result:** Shortly after, the market traded up into that level.

## Purpose of the Twitter Example

*   **Not a Trade Signal:** The tweet was not a trade signal (entry, stop, target).
*   **Teaching Tool:** The Speaker uses it to inspire students to look at price with the taught concepts in real-time before the chart shows it.
*   **Focus Attention:** Pointing attention to the right side of the marketplace and a level to study.
*   **Study, Don't Blindly Follow:** Study how price gets to that level.
*   **Admission of Fallibility:** The Speaker may be wrong at times.
*   **Observe Delivery:** Study if price delivers to the identified level by a specific time.
*   **Immediate Reaction Phenomenon:** Comments on Twitter seem to trigger immediate price movement towards the mentioned level.
*   **Possible Interpretation:** Let the Listener decide.

## Two-Minute Chart Disclaimer

*   **NOT** a trade entry or exit indicator.
*   Arrows do not represent actual trades.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining all original details, context, and nuances:

# Chart Journaling & Backtesting Techniques

## Chart Setup & Annotation

*   The speaker is graphically showing how to set up your chart for journaling purposes, rather than demonstrating an actual trade he personally executed.
*   **Order Block Identification:** Identify the down-closed candle (order block) prior to an upward price movement.
*   **Fair Value Gap:** Note the consolidation followed by a drop into the fair value gap.
*   The Fair Value Gap area should be marked.

## Twitter Example Analysis

*   **Tweet Context:** The speaker referenced a tweet he made.
*   **Tweet Content:** Look at this very valuable so price was here that was the moment of the tweet and then up to here it delivers
*   **Pattern Recognition:** Highlight that the pattern is accumulation, manipulation, distribution.
*   **Post-Event Chart Markup:** Go back to your charts and mark up the pattern accordingly for journaling

## Journaling Observations & Analysis

*   **Time to Delivery:**
    *   Measure the time it took for the market to begin delivering to the upside after entering the fair value gap.
    *   Example: If each candle represents two minutes, and the market enters the fair value gap, measure the subsequent candles.
    *   In the example, the market began delivering six minutes after hitting the fair value gap.
    *   It took approximately 20 minutes to fully deliver to the expected price level.
*   **Discount Analysis:**
    *   Assess if the price movement originated from a discount.
    *   In this case, the price moved from a low point.
    *   Consider the relationship to the New York midnight opening price.
    *   If the market dropped to a discount, creating the low of the day, and is now above this opening price, it's moving into the New York session lunch hour.

## New York Session Lunch Hour
*   We have time before 12 o'clock for this to potentially deliver but i was giving it time see if it wants to go there in the pm session which will be on the other side of lunch around one o'clock to 1 30 and then start to deliver that but like i was mentioning moments ago lately when i post or talk about anything it's like it wants to get there right away

## The Power of Self-Talk & Pseudo-Experience

*   **Journaling Focus:** Phrase observations in a way that suggests you anticipated the move beforehand.
*   **Subconscious Reinforcement:** This "tricks" the subconscious into believing you had the experience.
*   **Self-Talk Technique:** Reinforce positive outcomes through journaling to build confidence.
*   **Borrowing Experience:** Leverage the speaker's shared experiences on Twitter for your study, even if you didn't see the trade initially.

## Journaling Guidelines

*   **Positivity is Key:** Never include negative statements (e.g., "I wish I would have seen this").
*   **Avoid Self-Criticism:** Do not express frustration or self-doubt (e.g., "I'm never going to get this").
*   **Reflective Purpose:** Remember that journal entries are for future reflection, so maintain a positive tone.
*   **Fact-Oriented:** Keep entries factual and objective.
*   **Pretend You Knew:** Phrase entries as if you predicted the outcome.

## Long-Term Benefits of Journaling
*   **Experience Accumulation:** Over time (weeks, months, or even a year), you'll create a "pseudo-experience" through consistent journaling.
*   **Chart Logging:** Regularly log charts, retain them, and review them weekly and monthly.
*   **Pattern Recognition:** As you consistently do this, you will learn to see these patterns form live
*   **No Shortcuts:** There is no substitute for this hands-on approach.
*   **Failure Point:** Failure to engage in this journaling practice is a primary reason students fail under the speaker's tutelage.

## Market Context & Setup Recap

*   **Short-Term Low:** Observe the short-term low during the New York lunch hour.
*   **Consolidation & Stop Run:** Note the consolidation, the drop back down, and the taking out of that short-term low.
*   **Unfinished Business:** Observe the market targeting an older high (this represents a stop run).
*   **Preferred Setup:** The speaker's preferred setup was the short and the re-entry.

## Afternoon Session Example

*   **Vignette Reference:** See the vignette posted on Twitter for details on the speaker's short trade.
*   **Lack of Model Entry:** After the low was formed, there was no textbook model entry based on the speaker's teachings *yet*.
*   **Fair Value Gap Continuation:** There was a fair value gap with continuation on the upside.
*   **Real-Time Guidance:** The speaker pointed out this potential setup in real-time on Twitter before it unfolded.
*   **Not Demoed:** It's important to note the speaker did not take it in a demo account.

## Final Thoughts

*   **Insight and Helpfulness:** The speaker hopes the lecture was insightful and helpful.
*   **Future Contact:** The speaker plans to connect again next Tuesday, if all goes well.
*   **Closing Remark:** "Until I'll talk to you next time, be safe."

# **2022 Free ICT Mentorship: E-Mini S&P June Contract Analysis**

## **Introduction**

Welcome back to our continuing series on the **2022 free ICT mentorship on YouTube**. In this session, we're analyzing the **E-mini S&P June contract for 2022 on the daily chart**. We'll be diving into **intraday profiles and daily range analysis**.

**Video URL**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36184dDAqtM

## **Initial Market Bias and Draw on Liquidity**

Initially, I shared on Twitter that I was looking for a potential run to **4070**.

*   **4070** was my initial draw on liquidity to gauge market interest.

Looking at the chart, a fair value gap was present in this area. The price traded down into it initially, and then again today. After that second dip, the market started to move higher, leaving **relative equal lows** in place. I directed attention to the **previous day's high**, highlighting it as a potential midterm target if the upward trend continued.

*   **Previous Day's High:** A potential midterm target.

**Note**: I wasn't fully endorsing that target yet. The initial shift in intraday volatility indicated higher prices.

## **Lower Timeframe Analysis (Hourly Chart)**

Moving to the hourly chart, we can observe that the relative equal lows were not taken out. I was anticipating a dip into those levels, but it didn't happen. The model didn't materialize based on the framework I teach.

I used the **intraday volatility framework** to teach:

*   How to manage your bias.
*   How to change gears with your bias.

### **Key Takeaways: Bias Management**

Before diving deeper, let's focus on the main takeaways:

1.  What actions were taken?
2.  How to abandon a specific bias?
3.  How to change gears (when applicable)?
    *   Sometimes, reversing isn't appropriate. It's better to move to the sidelines.
4.  What characteristics lead to a change in bias?
5.  How to use that logic moving forward?
6.  How to navigate the New York lunch hour?

These topics will be addressed in this video.

## **Market Observations**

Notice the following pattern:

*   Lows are taken out repeatedly, followed by market reversals.
*   Absence of high-probability shorting opportunities.
*   The **4070** level was never tagged.
*   **Liquidity left in place**.
*   **Previous day's high (4168.25)** wasn't traded to.

We have a fair value gap, creating two premium arrays that could attract liquidity and potentially drive the market above the relative equal highs.

## **15-Minute Timeframe: Short-Term Shift**

On the 15-minute timeframe, the market continued to make lower lows before a run higher. This indicates a **short-term shift in market structure** relative to the 15-minute chart, which I consider my **bellwether chart**. This upward move created a fair value gap, which price then traded back down into.

## **Fair Value Gaps and Algorithmic Price Delivery**

Many are familiar with **Chris Lori** and his concept of **liquidity voids**, where the market seeks to fill in these areas. While this can occur, I teach differently because I understand the underlying algorithm.

It's crucial to identify:

*   Where the market is reaching for.
*   Imbalances in price.

A fair value gap is a fair value to buy if you're bullish.

**Key Differentiation from Chris Lori:** I don't insist that these imbalances *completely* rebalance.

### **Chris Lori Acknowledgment**

I believe if you want to learn price action basics, you can learn from him. I often recommend him. There's no business relationship or kickbacks; I simply think he's a nice guy.

### **Precision through Understanding**

My teaching provides a degree of precision that goes beyond simple imbalance rebounds.

*   I focus on where the market is *likely* to go next, determining the **draw on liquidity**.
*   Institutional calculations and algorithmic drivers determine the draw on liquidity, not simply buying/selling pressure.
*   I'm not prioritizing entry patterns with a strong emphasis on specific price levels.

To simplify complex factors, I avoid using indicators that suggest overbought or oversold conditions. Relying on indicators instead of reading price action is not wise.

## **Narrative and Market Context**

**Narrative**: Understanding what price *should* do, *why*, and what conditions will validate the narrative.

Today, I was looking for **4070** to see if the market could reach outside the daily fair value gap, which it failed to do. The market then shifted higher.

I observed the market, found no shorting opportunities, and then the market made its move. No panic, no FOMO.

We created a fair value gap on the 15-minute timeframe, making it an area to watch. If price dips into it and repels higher, taking out a short-term high, it sets the stage for the afternoon trend.

Because the market failed to reach the **4070** target, it respected the daily fair value gap and rallied. The daily chart showed that the short-term high was taken out, indicating a bullish market structure shift. The market returned to rebalance the fair value gap.

*I don't consider this resistance broken turning support.* The price dipped slightly past that level, going into my fair value gap.

I'm not focused on support and resistance. I'm looking for the fact that we went through a short-term high, created an imbalance, and then traded into it.

I'm interested in intermarket relationships.

## **5-Minute Chart Analysis**

The market dropped down sharply after I tweeted about **4070**, but then rallied.

Dropping into the 15-minute timeframe reveals a fair value gap. If you're not carrying over higher timeframe analysis into lower timeframes, you're trading blind.

*   I'm using multiple charts and monitors to inform my trading decisions.

I show my trades on Twitter, including entry points, price, and partials.

## **Twitter Stingers and Fair Value Gap References**

In my Twitter stingers, I use rectangles to highlight areas of interest. These rectangles represent potential areas where I might take profits. For example, if the price rallies after dipping into the fair value gap, I might take half my position off once it reaches a certain level again.

By sharing these references, I'm providing context for my analysis and decisions.

*   The rectangles also draw attention to:
    *   Old areas of buyside liquidity.
    *   An imbalance.

This helps me manage risk.

At **10:35**, I tweeted to note the previous day's high (4168.25). That was a high that we are likely to draw to.

## **New York Lunch Hour and Market Conditions**

I've given rules of engagement for trading the afternoon session. If the market is bullish on all timeframes, trading is relatively simple. But when inside a trading range, like the daily chart over the last week, it's crucial to know what you're doing.

**Remember:** I initially wanted the 4070 level, but we failed to go outside the daily fair value gap.

## **Divergence and Intermarket Relationships**

Notice that the lows on the S&P were *higher* than previous lows. This is important because if you overlay the **Nasdaq chart**, you'll see that the Nasdaq made a *lower* low, creating a divergence. The S&P was relatively stronger than the Nasdaq.

## **Opening Price and Advanced ICT Concepts**

The opening price at midnight is a key level. If we're bullish, we want to be buying at or close to the opening price.

**Advanced ICT Concept**: If you know the market is likely to go up, wait for a setup where the market shifts structure after going down, and then comes back down into a 15-minute fair value gap. This is an intraday/day trading model.


# **2022 Free ICT Mentorship: E-Mini S&P June Contract Analysis - Scalping Model and Daily Range Trading**

This section focuses on the scalping model provided for this YouTube channel, differentiating its use from daily range trading.

## **Scalping Model vs. Daily Range Trading**

*   The model presented on this YouTube channel is a **scalping model**.
*   For **day trading** focusing on the **daily range**, utilize the **15-minute** and **5-minute charts**.
*   The provided model can serve as **entry criteria for scalping**.
*   Apply the model's entry criteria in conjunction with the **logic and narrative** used in trading the daily range.

## **Power Three Concept and Market Structure Shifts**

Explaining the Power Three concept and how it relates to identifying market structure shifts.

*   **If bullish**, look for the **opening price at midnight**.
*   Price action should drop down, creating the **low of the day**.
    *   This was forming at **9:05** (corrected to **9:10**) New York local time.
*   A rally follows, shifting market structure.
*   While the objective wasn't met, it provided clues.

## **Real-Time Market Analysis and Bias Management**

Discussing the process of analyzing the market in real-time, managing biases, and the outcome of specific market predictions.

*   During this period, focus was on studying the market and working with his son, rather than tweeting.
*   The last Twitter communication indicated a target of **4070**.
*   There was no setup materializing; therefore, no trade was executed.
*   Since the market didn't reach the target and provided no setup, there was no loss.
*   If a public prediction doesn't materialize, the perception of being "wrong" depends on the audience.
    *   Some may view it as incorrect because **4070** didn't print.
*   However, if no trade is placed due to lack of setup, there's no loss, and being "wrong" is inconsequential.

## **Divergence, Fair Value Gaps, and Afternoon Setups**

Analyzing divergence patterns, fair value gaps, and strategies for afternoon trading sessions.

*   An **SMT divergence** was observed:
    *   Higher low in the S&P versus a lower low in the Nasdaq.
*   The market structure shifted and retraced into the **15-minute fair value gap**.
*   Following the retracement, another rally occurred.
*   This observation signaled readiness for the afternoon setup.
*   The market rallied but fell short of **4140**, another level previously mentioned on Twitter.
*   Price then dropped into the fair value gap and began to rally again.
*   Leaving smooth, relative equal highs.
*   The market then dropped below a short-term low.

## **Afternoon Session Trading Rules**

Describing rules for trading the afternoon session, particularly concerning liquidity sweeps and retracements.

*   **General Bullish Scenario:** The market rallies in the morning, consolidates during the lunch hour, and then sweeps below short-term lows or sell stops after lunch.
*   In this scenario, a low was created *before* the lunch hour at noon.
*   The market then dropped into the fair value gap.
*   **The difference:** Instead of consolidation, it was a retracement.
*   Identifying an area likely to retrace is key.
*   Measuring from a specific point aims to capture the alliance portion of the daily range.
*   The midnight opening price is factored in.
*   The swing low to swing high is considered the dealing range.
*   A small rectangle on the chart highlights:
    *   An old imbalance.
    *   A potential stall point.
    *   A possible consolidation before running for the previous day's high.

## **Retracement vs. Consolidation**

Discussing the importance of differentiating between retracements and consolidations during the lunch hour.

*   Taking out a short-term low on a retracement signals a different market dynamic than consolidation.
*   If it were consolidating, one would look for swing lows during the lunch hour, anticipating a sweep.
*   A retracement going into lunch signals that the market will continue to work through lunch.
*   **Floor Trader Analogy:** The concept of a "fast market" where floor traders stay busy during lunch, adapted to electronic trading through algorithmic behavior.

## **Algorithmic Repricing and Liquidity Targeting**

Explanation of algorithmic repricing, liquidity targeting, and smart money concepts.

*   In a fast market, the algorithm retraces into a fair value gap.
*   It creates a short-term low and rallies.
*   The algorithm reprices to a discount.
*   Once it reaches that point, it creates a short-term low and leaves smooth highs (perceived as resistance).
*   Short traders place their stops above these highs.
*   The market drops below the short-term low, targeting **sell stops** below it.
*   **Thinking like smart money:** Anticipating the market to go higher in the afternoon.
*   While the 4070 target was not reached in the morning, the logic for reading the markets is emphasized.
*   This skill set involves understanding when the market is turning and where setups will form.
*   The market drops into sell stops within the fair value gap during the lunch hour.

## **Trade Management and Adaptability**

Detailing real-time trade management techniques, including partial profit-taking and stop-loss adjustments.

*   The speaker managed the trade from a cell phone, adjusting stops and taking partials.
*   Contracts were taken off as the price moved higher, and the stop loss was raised.
*   The stop loss was placed below the fair value gap.
*   If the price returns to the fair value gap after multiple touches, the trade is exited.
*   **Key takeaway:** Focus on reading price action and adapting to market changes, rather than solely relying on a single model.
*   When the model provides no setup, experience and previously taught concepts are leveraged.
*   Time frames outside the 1-5 minute chart can be used with the same logic.
*   The goal is to develop a mindset that allows trading on various time frames, while understanding likely price movements and draws on liquidity.

## **Narrative and Afternoon Runs**

Describing the process of constructing a market narrative and identifying potential afternoon runs.

*   When the market shifted bullishly and retraced into the 15-minute fair value gap, it indicated a bullish setup for the afternoon.
*   This scenario suggests a potential run to the previous day's high.
*   On the daily chart, the shaded area represents the fair value gap.
*   The algorithm is priming itself for an afternoon run, potentially to the previous day's high.

## **Optimal Trade Entries and Liquidity Considerations**

Clarification of optimal trade entry points and how to consider liquidity dynamics.

*   This narrative alone isn't a buy signal; logical confirmation is needed.
*   Look for displacement and energetic price runs.
*   Measure from low to high to identify premium to discount levels.
*   Wait for a discount.
*   Sell-side liquidity (stop runs) is sought.
*   **Smart money mindset:** Buy sell stops.
*   The order fills underneath, buying on a specific candle.
*   The price rallies, consolidates, and then breaks through the old high and the 4140 level.
*   A short-term high is created, and the price rallies further.
*   The speaker draws a line to observe if price finds support on a down-closed candle (order block).
*   After price trades through it, the trade is exited.
*   Most of the trade was taken off during the rally, considering the possibility that the daily range might not reach the previous day's high.
*   Protecting the stop loss, which was never hit, was a priority.

## **Tweet Analysis and Market Context**

Final remarks on tweet analysis, market context, and overall strategy.

*   The initial tweet indicated a potential run down to **4070**.
*   The market reacted immediately, reaching a low of **4076**.
*   The market did not break below the fair value gap on the daily chart.
*   A later tweet at **10:35** drew attention to the previous day's high.
*   This indicated a potential retracement to a level before gravitating towards the high.
*   The optimal trade entry (fair value gap) represented a discount.
*   Moving from a discount to buy liquidity means that the premium array is higher, while the discount array is lower.


# **2022 Free ICT Mentorship: Trade Review and Market Insights**

## **Trade Anticipation and Execution**

*   The speaker anticipates a move, potentially originating from a specific point and running towards a high.
*   He plans to take a partial profit and observe if the price gravitates toward the high.
*   He emphasizes studying the market to develop this anticipatory sense.
*   This approach is also taught to students in his private group.

## **Mentorship Availability and Philosophy**

*   The speaker clarifies that his **private group is closed** and he no longer creates videos specifically for them.
*   The group primarily engages in casual discussion on a forum.
*   He emphasizes that he is providing **free mentorship** through these videos and his Twitter activity.
*   There are no payment requirements or obligations.
*   He guarantees that his teachings are effective if followed consistently.
*   He affirms that he personally used the same logic in his trading that day.
*   While he will continue to show trades, requests to join the private group will not be accepted.
*   Both paid members of his former private group and the public mentorship are benefiting from his simplified teachings.
*   He believes that simplifying complex concepts is crucial for effective learning.
*   He advises putting in the time to learn and not rushing the process.
*   He intends to continue providing this mentorship as long as he is able.
*   He is enjoying the process and the interaction with both private members and the public.
*   He requests that viewers refrain from asking to join the closed group to avoid causing him stress.

## **Market Outlook and Execution Details**

*   He suggests that a sweep upwards might occur, possibly during the Asian session.
*   He reviews specific execution details, referencing candle lows and his fill price.
*   On **one candle**, the low was **411 even**, and on the next the low came in at **4108 and a quarter**, and his fill was **41 10 and a quarter**.
*   He took a partial profit where the rectangle was drawn in the vignette video, selling half of his 10 contracts.
*   He considered the possibility of being wrong, so he took off half, and took another partial off later at **41 34 and a half**.
*   He tweeted and "paid the trader" after taking a partial profit.
*   He waited for the price to move above the old high and the **4140 level**, exiting at **41 41 and a half**, though slightly later than desired.
*   He closed his remaining contract, concerned about being stopped out, preferring to take profit at his chosen exit point.
*   The market failed to reach his objective for the day.
*   He highlights that he was able to profit even though he was "wrong" on both the **4070** and the higher target levels.
*   He emphasizes the importance of capturing the "lion's portion" of the move in the middle.
*   He suggests that this level of profitability should be sufficient, rather than striving for absolute highs and lows.

## **SMT Divergence Analysis**

*   He will now discuss **SMT (Smart Money Tool/Technique) divergences**.
*   He uses the "compare" tab in TradingView, comparing **NQM2022** (Nasdaq) and the S&P futures.
*   He notes that these symbols will change to **NQU2022** and **ESU2022**, respectively, to track the September contracts.
*   He monitors **bartchart.com** to determine when open interest is greater in the September contract before rolling over.
*   The "low" setting is highlighted when comparing the lows inside a fair value gap after a retracement.
*   He describes SMT divergence as his way of measuring real accumulation and distribution.
*   If the market is bullish, a line is plotted to compare and contrast lows.
*   He explains that if an area is a discount and there's a fair value gap, the market trades down into liquidity (sell stops).
*   His strategy is to "buy sell stops" inside the fair value gap during a classic "buy day" scenario.
    *   Open at midnight, trade down to create the low of the day, then rally.
*   **SMT divergence** is used to buy the short-term low.
*   **SMT divergence between the Nasdaq and S&P indicates real accumulation**.
*   This suggests that the Nasdaq is failing to go lower (under accumulation) and the S&P's move is a stop hunt.

## **Optimal Trade Entry Techniques**

*   He acknowledges that some viewers find his teachings complex.
*   He offers several strategies for optimal trade entry.
    *   **Optimal Trade Entry with Fib:** Use the low to the high, pull your Fib to the 62-79% level, and buy when the market reaches that level.
    *   **Turtle Soup:** Identify a low, a lower low, and buy the low that is being violated with optimal trade entry.
    *   **Fair Value Gap:** Identify a fair value gap below the 50% level (a discount). Buy as soon as it trades at the top level of it. Place a stop loss below the lower low or level here.
    *   **Buying Strength:** Wait for the market to trade down into the fair value gap, find the swing high prior to trading into the fair value gap, and put a buy stop there as your entry.
*   He stresses the importance of calibrating bias based on the market's behavior at key times, such as 9:30 AM.

## **Patience and Confirmation**

*   After volatility at 9:30 AM, the market often shifts higher, showing real accumulation in the S&P.
*   He avoids chasing the rally, waiting for a retracement into a 15-minute time frame fair value gap.
*   He could buy at the fair value gap, but prefers to wait for confirmation that the 4070 level won't be taken out.
*   He emphasizes the importance of waiting for the market to communicate the algorithmic narrative of a bullish afternoon session.
*   He advocates for giving up the morning session if necessary.
*   He states that just because he is sitting in front of charts doesn't mean he has to take a trade.
*   He stresses the need for patience in both waiting for the setup and letting the trade play out.

## **Dealing Range and Smart Money Concepts**

*   Once the market enters the 15-minute fair value gap and rallies, he is comfortable looking for his setup.
*   He identifies the dealing range (low to high) and uses a Fibonacci retracement.
*   He looks for a fair value gap below the 50% level and aims to "buy sell stops".
*   He wants to align his trades with what "smart money" is doing.
*   He bought the specific candle at **41 10 and a quarter**, below the low of **41 10 and a half**.
*   He emphasizes that he is providing real-time examples of his teachings.
*   He uses the same logic consistently, not creating false or misleading scenarios.
*   He believes he is teaching what truly works in the market.
*   He highlights an **SMT divergence** with a lower low in Nasdaq and a higher low in S&P, setting the stage for the rally.

## **Content Strategy and Conclusion**

*   He could continue analyzing the chart for much longer, but wants to keep videos concise.
*   He acknowledges viewers who prefer longer videos but notes that attention spans are typically around 10 minutes.
*   He attempts to stay in that vicinity to maintain viewer engagement.
*   He is aware that many viewers use the 2x speed function.
*   He hopes viewers found the information insightful and encouraging.
*   He emphasizes that he is showing practical applications, not just theoretical concepts.
*   He closes by wishing viewers safety and promising to connect again on Twitter and in the next mentorship lecture on Thursday.

# S&P Futures Contract Analysis: June 2022

## Video Reference
*   **Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFpHbBnsK_c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFpHbBnsK_c)

## Chart Setup
*   **Contract:** S&P Futures Contract for June 2022
*   **Left-hand side:** Daily Chart
*   **Right-hand side:** One-Hour Chart
    *   Used to save time.

## Key Concept: Timeframe Sensitivity
*   Focus on **sensitive levels** on the higher timeframe.
*   Understand how those levels are **subordinate** on the lower timeframe.

## Pre-Market Analysis & Commentary

### Initial Trading Range
*   Recently, the market had been in a trading range.
*   Potential scenario: If price starts to move higher and has **displacement** to the upside, this could be a **draw on liquidity.**
    *   This was the near-term objective being looked for.

### Impact of News (Unemployment Data)
*   News events (specifically unemployment data) have a significant impact on markets.
    *   Described as a "heavy weight around the neck of the markets."
*   There was a move lower *before* the market opening at 9:30 AM.

### Initial Stance & Target
*   Until some kind of **displacement** occurred, there wasn't much interest in the marketplace.
*   **Target:** 4070 as a potential draw on liquidity (below relative equal lows).
    *   Target shared *before* 9:30 AM.
    *   Looking for evidence to support a run below relative equal lows.
*   If the market went below those lows, it would draw into a fair value gap.

### Transparency & Accountability
*   Content and ideas are time and date stamped on Twitter.
*   The speaker doesn't delete tweets, even if there are typos.
*   Acknowledging potential errors due to age and eyesight.
*   Commitment to transparency, "not sweeping anything under the rug."

### Expectation of Volatility
*   Expecting the volatility to be significant enough to take the market below the lows.
*   If that occurred, anticipating a draw all the way down into the stated area.
*   Implication: A large range day on the daily chart.

### Goal: Providing Predictability
*   Hopes to provide insights that show these market movements are predictable.

## Addressing Imperfections & Losses

### Acknowledging a Recent Loss
*   Yesterday, an idea was mapped out on Twitter, and a loss occurred.
    *   A five-point loss.
    *   Not considered a significant loss.
*   A level was identified later in the afternoon where the loss could have been regained.

### Reasoning Behind Sharing Losses
*   Not meant to be boastful or egotistical.
*   Intention: To show what it's like to make mistakes, and to avoid rushing to fix them.
    *   Applies to both demo accounts and live trading.
*   Discouragement of trading with live funds while learning these concepts.

### Message to Experienced Traders
*   Some viewers are already profitable traders.
*   Even profitable traders shouldn't use live funds *while learning these specific concepts*.

## Call for Community Input

### Request for Feedback
*   Viewers are requested to provide feedback in the comment section about what they would like to see covered in future videos.
*   Offering a suggestion, open to community input.

## Detailed Chart Analysis

### Daily Chart (Left Side)

#### Relative Equal Lows
*   Focus was on the **sell side** or a bearish bias.
*   If the market went below those lows, it wasn't going to go down there to go up.
*   It was going down into a specific area.
#### Hourly Chart (Right Side)

#### Transposition of Levels
*   Levels from the daily chart are transposed onto the hourly chart.
    *   This level on the hourly chart corresponds to this level on the daily chart.
*   Start annotations on higher timeframes, keeping them simple.
*   Look for a level that the market is going to draw to, and/or key levels that may change or suggest a bias.

#### Bearish Bias Condition
*   A belief that the market was likely to go down below the lows and into the targeted area.
*   Not just hitting relative equal lows to go the other way.

#### Importance of Narrative
*   Narrative is crucial.
*   Requires experience.
*   The speaker is lending his experience to help viewers grow faster.

#### Epiphany and Alignment
*   The "epiphany" for students is when they watch something play out as expected on their own charts.
*   Feels like being "in alignment with the marketplace."
*   This feeling motivates them to dig deeper, which in turn inspires the mentor.

#### Feedback Request
*   Viewers who anticipated the market movement based on the pre-market commentary are encouraged to comment about their experience.

#### Hourly Chart Details
*   Fair value gap was present.
*   Swing low.
*   Displacement.
*   Consolidation going into midnight New York time.
*   Rally into a fair value gap and bearish order block.

#### Order Block Analysis
*   Trading into a bearish order block.
*   Focus on areas with three candles, where the middle candle has an exposed area not overlapped by the previous candle's low.
*   Price goes above, hits the order block.
*   Candle bodies largely stay between the two levels.
*   Acknowledging wicks, but emphasizing the volume encapsulation.

#### Drawing Attention to Key Areas
*   Interest in seeing the market go below the lows.
*   Presence of an old low in the back.
*   Even without the commentary, the framework should have identified a run to that low.

#### Midnight Opening Price
*   Price or level at midnight New York local time is extended out in time.

#### Integrating Pre-Market Analysis
*   Before the market opened, it was stated (on Twitter, in a video, in a post) that there was interest in seeing those lows taken out and a draw on liquidity at 4070.
*   Viewers should have been studying that level to understand its potential interest.

#### Learning Process and Frustration
*   Some students may want information "spoon-fed" to them, but that's not the teaching style.
*   Learning is more productive by going into the charts, looking for evidence and details.

#### Framework Recap
*   Given a bearish bias.
*   Given an objective (a draw on liquidity).
*   Shown the framework for the daily range and the opening price at midnight.
*   Suggesting a bearish day and a draw to 4070.

#### Power 3 Concept Integration
*   Power 3: Accumulation of shorts, the manipulation of those shorts.
*   Judas swing: Market goes up to a short-term premium.
*   Market breaks lower, trades below the short-term relative equal lows.
*   Retraces, consolidates, breaks once more.
*   Attacks the sell side and aggressively runs through the 4070 level.

#### Short Position Strategy
*   If short, take a partial profit.
*   Wait for the daily range to fulfill.
    *   Specifically, wait for the last hour of trading (3:00 PM - 4:00 PM).

### Shifting Timeframes (15-Minute and 5-Minute)

#### 15-Minute Chart and 5-Minute Chart

#### Breakdown of Price Action
*   Rally into a fair value gap on the hourly chart.
*   Breakdown.
*   Trading back above the opening price at midnight.
*   Breaks lower, consolidates.
*   Breaks once more, trades up into a fair value gap, breaks lower, and aggressively runs into that higher timeframe daily fair value gap.
#### 5-Minute Chart Details
*   Equities opening at 9:30 AM.
*   Price was initially showing weakness and going lower.
*   Traders getting caught short.
*   Anticipating a reprice to 4105 with buy side liquidity resting there and a fair value gap.

#### Demo Trade Example
*   After the post, the market ran to that level.
*   A demo trade was entered and profits were taken below the short-term low.
*   Reversal detection and stop management.
*   Took a second partial off it routed once more blowing out that short-term high.

#### Market Chop
*   Significant chop in the initial opening range.
    *   Low.
    *   Higher high.
    *   Lower low.
    *   Lower low again.
    *   Rally through this high.
*   Fair value gap left behind.

#### Trading Levels
*   Price traded back down into fair value gap once more back into the opening price at midnight
*   If bearish, go short at or above that level (or as close as possible).
*   Between 11:00 AM and noon, the market consolidates, retraces back up.
*   Takes buy side liquidity.
*   Breaks lower again.
*   Aggressively runs for that 4070 level and then down into the daily fair value gap.

#### Daily Range on 5-Minute Chart
*   Opening price at midnight.
*   Price gravitates around that level.
*   In London, the market rallies and builds in a premium ahead of the 8:30 AM time window.
*   The market creates the high, takes out short-term sell side liquidity.
*   Retraces back up and consolidates for the majority of the afternoon.
*   Breaks lower and then aggressively attacks the sell side below 4070.
*   Consolidates and closes inside that larger daily fair value gap.

### Afternoon Session Trading Rules

#### Considering the Daily Range
*   Before trading in the afternoon, consider what the daily range is trying to do.
    *   Is it trying to expand higher?
    *   Is it trying to expand lower?
    *   Did it reverse in the morning session, and is it going to have a counter-trend move?
    *   Is it going to consolidate while waiting for a big news event the following day?

#### Context of the Day
*   The day in question had a big news event (employment data).
*   The market consolidated and had a bearish bias.
*   A target of 4070 was identified beforehand (based on experience).

#### Framework
*   The framework was one-sided and specific about what was being looked for.

#### Post-Lunch Market Action
*   After lunch (1:00 PM New York local time).

#### Lunch Hour Market Behavior
*   Lunch hour identified as 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM New York.
*   "The market will clear the stops during the lunch hour."
*   Highs formed during the lunch hour were identified as buy-side liquidity.
*   At 1:00 PM, the algorithm reprices and runs to take the stops above the buy side.

#### Fast Market Dynamics
*   If the market is going to be fast during the lunch hour, it can create a significant high or low.
*   If bearish, look for the highs to be swept.
*   They don't want participants to be profitable that may have assumed a short position from the morning session.

#### Smart Money Strategy
*   Smart money utilizes this run above the short-term high as an influx of buying interest and liquidity that is available immediately.


Okay, here is the reorganized and restructured text based on your instructions. All details are included, and it has been formatted for improved readability and analysis:

# S&P Futures Contract Analysis: June 2022 (Continued)

## Smart Money Strategy and Order Exploitation

*   The market is being priced and held at a specific level.
*   **Smart Money** enters and sells to buyers whose orders are resting nearby.
    *   These buyers' stops are triggered, knocking them out of their short positions.
*   Conversely, traders seeing the high being broken may get long, triggering buy stops on a breakout.
*   **Smart Money cannibalizes these two types of orders**:
    *   Buy-side liquidity.
*   The counterparty to their short position *must* have buying interest.
    *   This buying interest is engineered by the algorithm and runs up.
*   Smart Money goes short with the expectation of taking profits:
    *   At an old low of 4070.
    *   Then 440.
    *   Then into the fair value gap on the daily chart.

## Sticking to the Rules: Avoiding Lunch Hour Trading

*   Adherence to the model being taught.
*   If you don't trade during the lunch hour, that's acceptable.
*   Wait until after lunch to set up a trade.

## ICT Bearish Breaker Explained

*   For those studying the speaker's YouTube channel, this swing low to a higher high is a **breaker**.
*   **ICT Bearish Breaker Definition:** A pattern where price runs out a pool of liquidity (buy-side liquidity in this case), then reverses and trades back down below the short-term low.
*   If it trades back up, and the narrative is bearish, consider the following:
    *   It's not *just* about the pattern.
    *   You *must* know what the market is likely reaching for.
    *   Without this, it's a gamble, a guess, and aimless speculation.
*   The down-closed candle (the lowest one prior to the move up) clears that short-term high.
*   This is taught on the speaker's YouTube channel.

## Navigating the YouTube Content

*   If you've gone through the 2022 mentorship videos, you're welcome to view other videos as well.
*   Focus on *this* series, as it's easy to get inundated with information from other series, creating questions that aren't pertinent to *this* model.

## Judging Market Continuation

*   A comprehensive view of judging whether the market is likely to continue going lower.
*   As price moves back up to a level:
    *   Expect that level to repel price and go lower.
    *   Be aggressive about trading below that level because there's sell-side liquidity there.
    *   It shouldn't go below this low to go higher.
    *   It should go *through* there and accelerate downward.
    *   It wants to run quickly for that 4070 level due to the larger pool of liquidity below it.
    *   Aggressively run into that fair value gap on the daily chart because that's the imbalance the algorithm will want to reprice to in the afternoon.

## Post-Breaker Trading

*   Post-breaker being traded results in heaviness falling below 4070 and then accelerating.
*   Small consolidation with no retracement.
*   No return back to an old low.
*   Broken support does *not* become resistance.
*   This is an algorithmic sell day.
    *   Retail traders don't get to do a lot of those retail concepts.
    *   You're either on board beforehand, or you watch the ship sail off without you.
*   440 gets traded through and back into that daily fair value gap, which was mentioned as the likely target for the day.

## Sharing the Model: Teaching His Son Caleb

*   The speaker promised on Twitter to share the model he's teaching his son Caleb.
*   He did a "rant" on Saturday about it.
*   The speaker tested the Twitter Spaces feature this weekend.
*   Not afraid to teach it, but wanted to ensure his son had some foundation.
*   Wanted to spend time with his son and understand his characteristics, concerns, fears, and comfort level.
    *   Is he trying to trade the whole daily range?
    *   Or is he trying to get in and out quickly with small profits?
*   You can't just take a model because someone else is doing well with it.
    *   It must match your personality and how you see and engage price action, or you'll never make it work.

## Awareness of Learning Challenges

*   Cognizant of the effect on individuals learning things.
*   This is especially true with something as technical as this, in this industry, with as many variables for choices.
*   Consider all the indicators, trading styles, methodologies, and teachers with their respective personalities.
*   You have to be able to put up with them and listen to them to learn from them.
*   The speaker can be off-putting and can't retain the attention of everyone.
*   Some may not like his teaching style or have faith in him.
*   He's not going to "scratch the itch" for everyone.

## Live Account Example: Caleb's Trading

*   For those who want to learn from the speaker, he's using live accounts this year.
*   His son started trading a live account in the first week of May with AMP Futures.
    *   The speaker is *not* endorsing them, just reporting facts.
    *   Caleb hasn't reported any issues with fills being executed professionally.
    *   The only issue was AMP Futures' unhappiness with the speaker sharing one of Caleb's statements.
    *   The speaker took it down but can still talk about the numbers.
*   Caleb had an equity low of 2810.
*   Until recently, he was at 18,300+ (he didn't trade today).
    *   They were observing, teaching, and doing trades.
    *   Caleb was in the position of spectating, not speculating, because the speaker wanted him to understand that large range days can creep in and may not look clear in the morning.
    *   The speaker was showing that beforehand in the marketplace and commentary on Twitter.
*   In about four weeks, that's about a 400% return.
    *   That's a remarkable growth, showing he knows what he's looking for.
    *   He wants to grow his account and not try to hit grand slam home runs.
*   Because he works at a low-paying job, it's easy to hit that threshold he earns weekly.

## Tailoring the Model to Caleb's Needs

*   One of the things the speaker felt was imperative was that Caleb has a short attention span and is easily distracted.
*   He wanted to give him a model with a low threshold for a return of points or pips.
*   They settled on the index futures market, which ignores the spread issues that plague forex traders.
*   It's a professional and very liquid market.
*   The E-mini S&P is systematic in how it delivers price.
*   The speaker wants to take him to the chart at a specific time of day with a specific logic in mind.
*   Hopefully, he'll see a pattern that repeats.
*   If it doesn't form that day, he has to move to the sidelines and do nothing.

## Squashing the Fear of Missing Out

*   The choice to say "I don't see it today."
*   If something forms after the charts close or the trader moves away, the fear of missing out needs to be squashed quickly.
*   The only way to do that is by backtesting and seeing how many times these things form.
*   The speaker is giving his experiences as close as possible.
*   The speaker is literally acting like the internal voice for him.
    *   "Okay, what do you see here? What do you see there? What happens if you did this?"
*   He has that inside advantage, that home-field advantage.
*   He's pushing the buttons.
*   If he elects to do nothing, sometimes the market moves; he's not in it.
*   Sometimes he does something, and the market does something against him.
*   He has the decision of whether to let the stop loss get hit or bail now and figure out what he did wrong.

## Focusing on Algorithmic Price Action

*   May not be the ideal learning conditions for everyone, but the speaker knows where he's leading him.
*   He needs to be prepared to look for a specific element in price action, and it's algorithmic.
*   He's not sitting down with him with anything retail.
*   Not filling his head up with bull flags, bear flags, or when they fail.
*   He's not teaching him trend lines or bringing any of that stuff in.
*   He's taking him right to the brass tacks of what the algorithm will do.
*   He only wants him to be a one-trick pony right now, so he can feel confident to leave his job.

## The Algorithm: A Loose Framework

*   He's going to give the loose framework of what he tries to teach him and what he's looking for.
*   He reminds viewers that price is delivered by an algorithm.
*   There's no buying and selling pressure; that's used as an excuse.
*   Algorithmic theory is based on **time and price**.
*   The algorithm coding leans heavily on the **time** element.
    *   What time of day?
    *   What day of the week?
    *   What week of the month?
    *   What month of the year?
    *   What seasonal influences?
*   Several factors are encoded in the algorithm that seek these recurring phenomena, which can be capitalized on by those who know what they're hunting.
*   That little billboard that flashes, "Hey, it's time for you to engage now!"
*   That signal, that pattern, that setup, that framework—the moment right before you push a button.
*   He's taking his attention to that specific element, taking away all the other distractions.

## Time and Price: Key Considerations

*   Price levels are useless until *time* is considered.
*   Support and resistance is a fallacy.
*   Many instances where, in hindsight, a line worked and repelled price up or down.
*   The problem retail traders have is picking the right level consistently.
*   The speaker experienced that same thing, being unable to pick the right support and resistance level, even on higher timeframes.
*   Sometimes a move will go up, hit a level that would be otherwise viewed as resistance, and then start to go down, then go one more time up higher, and then higher high takes the stop.
*   Then, the trader is afraid to go back in and go short.
*   Those stop-out events create fear and anxiety.
*   Time has to be considered *first* because the algorithm will start working a specific macro (a short order of things it will do as instructions).
*   It's going to seek a specific level, move to a premium, move to a discount, suddenly move or consolidate, and wait for another time element in that same trading day, trading week, or month.
*   Your inability to know everything about time will be the area where you have the largest growth, but you'll have the initial adversities (when to do this, when to do that).
*   Over time, you'll understand why certain things are occurring at a specific time.

## Blending Time and Price for Precision

*   Time is of no use unless price is at a key **PD Array**.
*   Blending the two yields astonishing results.
*   Precision in examples proving prognostication, forecasting objectives, and targets.
*   The speaker's task is to help make you aware.
I hope this helps.


Okay, here is the reorganized and restructured text based on your instructions. All details are included, and it has been formatted for improved readability and analysis:

# Algorithmic Trading: A Mentorship Approach

## Introduction: The Wizard and the Craft

*   "You a wizard, okay? I'm teaching you the craft."
*   This isn't a performance, but an active teaching experience.
*   Engagement techniques are used to maintain attention, especially for those easily bored.
*   The goal is to make learning effective and lasting.

## Seeing the Unseen: Decoding Price Action

*   To new students, price action can seem like a "foreign language."
*   Without understanding, price movements appear random and without reason.
*   The speaker gains pleasure from watching people discover the algorithm's consistent patterns.
*   Removing the "noise" and adding "a little bit of lipstick" (context) reveals valuable insights.

## The Foundation: Time Over Price

*   The first element of algorithmic theory is **time**, not price.
*   For index futures traders, the morning session begins at **8:30 AM** New York time.
*   This is when the news embargo lifts, and economic reports are typically released.
*   It's why traders should set their clocks to New York local time on TradingView.
*   The **8:30 AM** candle is key.

## Targeting Liquidity Pools

*   The speaker teaches his son to target specific liquidity pools.
*   This requires a clear idea of where the market is likely to move (buy-side or sell-side).
*   **Rejecting Retail Fallacies:** This model is not based on support and resistance.
*   Retail traders often fail because they force a system designed to fail.
*   It's essential to understand *why* the market behaves as it does.
*   Why is price moving in a certain way?
*   Why is it going to specific levels at specific times?
*   There is logic behind the movements.

## The Algorithm's Control

*   Every minute fluctuation in price is controlled, engineered, and premeditated.
*   This control is executed by:
    *   **AI (Artificial Intelligence):** The algorithm following its code.
    *   **Manual Intervention:** Deliberate manipulation to move price to specific levels.
*   Manual interventions can be:
    *   **Abrupt and Aggressive:** Unpleasant but informative.
    *   **Exhilarating:** Profitable if you're on the right side.
*   Example: FOMC rate announcements causing aggressive repricing.
*   The economic calendar helps predict these events.
*   The speaker encourages his son to engage on days with medium or high-impact news or practice when news is light with reduced risk.

## Time Elements: 8:30 AM and 9:30 AM

*   The first element of time in this model is **8:30 AM**.
*   The second is **9:30 AM**.
*   The opening price at midnight New York local time is crucial.
    *   If the market rallies *above* that price at **8:30 AM** and a bearish move is expected, look to short at or above the opening price.
    *   This aims to capture movement on the daily range on a down day.

## Power 3 Concept and Liquidity Runs

*   The "Power 3" concept involves shorting at or above the opening price at midnight New York time.
*   The market runs up to take out short-term highs (a run on liquidity).
*   This triggers stops on lower time frames.
*   The algorithm *doesn't* care about volume above or below penetrated highs or lows.

## Pac-Man Analogy: Understanding Limitations

*   **Analogy:** Think of price movements like Pac-Man in a maze.
*   What keeps Pac-Man within the maze's boundaries?
    *   **Program Language:** Sets the limitations.
    *   **Game Maze:** Has programmed limitations.
*   Similarly, daily ranges have programmed limitations until manual intervention removes them.

## Applying the Analogy to Trading

*   At 8:30 AM, price is above the opening price at midnight.
*   The market runs a short-term high (buy-side liquidity).
*   Since it's a bearish day, what's likely to happen?
    *   Reprice for sell-side liquidity.
*   Where is the sell-side liquidity?
    *   Around **4101** or the **4100** big figure level.
*   Liquidity rests below old lows.
*   Sell-side liquidity is at a discount.
*   The algorithm moves from buy-side liquidity at 8:30 AM (on a bearish day, above the opening price) to sell-side liquidity.

## Executing the Trade: A Step-by-Step Approach

*   Wait for the market to trade lower.
*   A short-term low swings through it.
*   Creates a fair value gap.
*   Rally back up to it.
*   Sell short, expecting it to run to sell-side liquidity.
*   This is the core strategy being taught to his son at 8:30 AM.

## Profit Targets: Five Points and Beyond

*   The initial target is **five points**.
*   Once achieved, stop trading for the moment.
*   Reasoning:
    *   Five points are easily attainable.
    *   Anything less is ultra-short-term scalping, and commission costs will negate profits.
    *   Five points can be reasonably achieved even on choppy days.

## Managing Expectations

*   Caution: Don't expect to replicate these results immediately if you're new.
*   This is a long-term goal to work toward.
*   Eventually, the expectation is that his son will:
    *   Have a better understanding of the market.
    *   Take a portion off at five points.
    *   Hold for the liquidity pool to be hit.
    *   This rewards him and shows the potential to earn more than his job.

## Context Matters: Individual Coaching

*   It's crucial to understand that his son has a unique advantage:
    *   The speaker as his father.
    *   Personalized coaching and guidance.
*   The speaker is "co-piloting" him, providing real-time insights.
*   Don't assume that a few talks with "daddy" led to a 400% gain.
*   It's an immersive, sometimes intimidating, experience with constant feedback and repetition.

## Dealing with Emotions and Real Money

*   The speaker teaches his son to respect the market.
*   He experiences both positive and negative emotions with real money at stake.
*   The speaker allows him to feel the consequences of his trades.
*   Over time, he will learn to trade beyond five points by default.

## Low-Hanging Fruit Approach

*   This teaching approach mirrors what he taught on BabyPips: aim for 25 pips a week.
*   This is for new students to gain encouragement and feel progress.
*   It's not a lifetime limitation; it's a starting point.
*   Critics often take his words out of context.

## The Power of Consistent Small Wins

*   Consider the potential of consistently making just five points a day.
*   One contract of the E-mini S&P:
    *   One point = $50.
    *   Five points = $250 per day.
    *   That's $1250 per week.

## Subscriber Perks and Realistic Expectations

*   The speaker appreciates his YouTube subscribers.
*   He prioritizes answering questions from subscribers in the comments.
*   Don't expect to make five points *every* day.
*   Even the speaker takes losses.
*   The key is to focus on long-term growth and skill development.
*   It's okay to take a loss and not immediately try to recover it.
*   The speaker proves he can still accurately predict market movements, even after a loss.
*   He lays "breadcrumbs" (evidence) on Twitter, which he never deletes, to guide his followers.
I hope this helps.


Okay, here is the reorganized and restructured text based on your instructions. All details are included, and it has been formatted for improved readability and analysis:

# Algorithmic Trading: Mastering the Craft Through Discipline and Observation

## Introduction: Earning the Skillset - No Spoon-Feeding

*   "But I'm not going to spoon feed you. You're going to earn it here, and that makes some of you angry."
*   Frustration is a natural part of the learning process.
*   No amount of complaint will change the teaching approach.
*   **Reason:** The value and appreciation of the skillset are directly proportional to the effort invested.
*   There's a difference between knowing *how* to do something (like a magic trick from a book) and being *good* at doing it.

## The 8:30 AM Setup: A Bearish Scenario

*   The speaker teaches his son a specific setup to look for at **8:30 AM**.
*   This setup is specifically for a **bearish** scenario.
*   Key elements:
    *   Look for liquidity below the market price.
    *   Identify a framework that presents a fair value gap.
*   This setup focuses on a run to liquidity.
*   **Profit Target:** If the setup yields five points, exit the trade, *even* if the framework suggests a potential for 30 points.

## Addressing the Critics: Five-Point Target

*   Anticipating criticism about the five-point target, the speaker addresses potential naysayers.
*   He preemptively counters the argument that targeting only five points, despite a potential 30-point move, is indicative of inexperience.
*   **Counter-Arguments:**
    *   This strategy is employed by someone with a 400+% monthly gain.
    *   This is also employed by someone who hasn't had a losing day in weeks.
*   **Conclusion:** "So sit down, take notes, or move along."

## The 9:30 AM Opportunity: Equity Open

*   The next opportunity arises at **9:30 AM**, the equity open.
*   The speaker references a specific example outlined on Twitter, where the market initially moved lower at the open.
*   **Prediction:** Price would be taken up into the fair value gap and clear **4105**.
*   This prediction was time and date stamped and verifiable on Twitter.
*   **Rationale:**
    *   **4105** represented buy-side liquidity.
    *   Stop losses were likely clustered at that level.
    *   The fair value gap indicated a likely repricing point.
*   The market subsequently dropped from that level.

## Demonstrating Transparency: Live Trading and Accountability

*   The speaker emphasizes his commitment to transparency and avoids any appearance of "pump and dump" schemes.
*   He records himself saying "pay the trader" before taking partials as price moves below a specific low.
*   This recording serves as proof that he's not manipulating the market for personal gain.
*   He wants to be the best friend you could have in these markets.

## The Value of Discipline and Consistency

*   He asks for nothing other than a subscription.
*   The speaker underscores the importance of consistent effort and engagement, even when confused.
*   Discipline is key, and results will manifest differently for each individual, on their unique timeline.
*   He's in this for the long haul.

## Afternoon Setup Confirmation

*   This setup eventually came back and ran back above the short-term high and ran here so we went one more time where above the new york midnight opening price so we're at a premium and above the opening price at midnight and consolidates in here and then it breaks down and later on in the afternoon we'll see what it does.

## Trade Execution and Management: A Detailed Example

*   The speaker describes his own trade execution in detail.
*   He entered short, aiming for a specific target.
*   As price moved favorably, he tweeted "take partials or pay the trader first."
*   He then closed two contracts in his demo account as price went below that low.
*   He actively managed expectations by demonstrating how to manage a demo account.

### Order Block Analysis: Repelling Price

*   The speaker outlines a specific order block that repelled price.
*   He extended this order block and noted that it was proving problematic.

### Preemptive Partial Closure

*   He had pre-set an order to partially close three more contracts and had moved his stop to better than break even.
*   When price moved above the order block, he closed the three contracts *before* the stop was hit.
*   **Reasoning:**
    *   Closing the entire order would have felt like panic.
    *   A stop loss serves its purpose.
    *   Taking profits before the stop allows for capturing gains even if the trade ultimately reverses.
*   Remaining three contracts were stopped out at a profit.
*   He didn't take a large enough position off.

### Key Question: Why This Candle?

*   The crucial question is: why was the speaker concerned about that particular candle and why did he close three contracts when price moved above it?

### Liquidity Pool Analysis: Sell-Side Taps

*   Referencing the sell-side liquidity pool outlined on Twitter and in the video, the speaker explains the logic.
*   Price went below old lows (sell-side tapped).
*   It then created relative equal lows (another level of sell-side).
*   This was followed by another low being taken (more sell-side).
*   Multiple levels of sell-side liquidity were taken *without significant downward movement*.

### Up-Close Candle Problem

*   Since buy-side liquidity had been taken, price should have moved aggressively lower.
*   The up-close candle (institutional overflow) *should* have capped price on the upside.
*   **Problem:** It didn't.
*   This indicated a potential failure of the bearish setup.

### Proactive Risk Management

*   This prompted the speaker to proactively pull up the order to take three contracts off.
*   He was prepared to reduce his position because he recognized the potential for the trade to fail.
*   He chose this approach over simply closing the entire trade to provide a more instructive example.
*   Even if the trade reverses temporarily, it might resume in the original direction.

### Algorithm's Shift: Seeking Buy-Side Liquidity

*   Taking out the up-close candle, *after* taking multiple levels of sell-side liquidity, signaled a shift in the algorithm's objective.
*   **New Target:** Seek buy-side liquidity.
*   Where is it? Above the recent high.
*   Thus, the market was doing a run up here and then back above midnight opening handle price at opening New York local time at midnight.

## The Afternoon Session: 1:30 PM

*   In the afternoon, the speaker teaches his son to look for setups around **1:30 PM**.
*   **Focus:** Identify areas where buy stops have been taken.
*   Look for a breakdown, followed by a return to a bearish breaker.
*   Then, look for downward displacement (a strong move lower) as a potential entry.
*   **Valid Setup Example:**
    *   Equal lows get broken (sell side liquidity grab).
    *   Creates an imbalance.
    *   Price trades back up into it.
    *   Short it, aiming for five points.

## Connecting the Dots: Experience and Intuition

*   He is watching and studying does it go to that 40-70 level that I was talking about does it go down to that daily fair value gap that I was talking about before the market opened this morning and those things will deposit pseudo experience that over time results into real experience and then he can lean on those instances of experience where he's been here before he's not intimidated if he's done it wrong he's not fearful that the market's changing the way it does things because he's now suddenly profitable and it has a you know series of losing trades or whatever he's not losing his mind because he has taken a trade that he felt was lined with likelihood and probabilities in his favor but then failed he's not discouraged by that because he knows that these things repeat.

## Trading Schedule and Discipline

*   **Daily Opportunities:** Best case scenario, there are three potential trading opportunities per day.
*   **Target:** Only one opportunity needs to yield five points.
*   Achieving this target would result in earnings exceeding half of his weekly salary.
*   The goal is to condition himself to paper trade after one live trade in one session (morning or afternoon).

### Avoiding Greed: The Power of Choice

*   **Question:** Why not trade every session move if he's so good?
*   **Answer:** To instill discipline and avoid greed.
*   Knowing he *can* make more, but choosing not to, fosters confidence, assurance, and contentment.
*   This understanding prevents over-trading and eliminates fear.
*   New students are afraid of the strategy failing.

## Addressing Concerns About Market Saturation

*   The speaker assures that the market won't "break" due to increased followers.
*   Others will find different setups and he can do other things not even on the charts.
*   Those who blindly follow signals without discipline are unlikely to succeed.
*   Undisciplined traders are recreating the wheel.
*   They're trying to add authorship to what they learned from him because it's clout.

## The Quiet Achievers

*   The ones that are quiet are doing the best because they only care about results.

## Specific Afternoon Trading

*   **Time:** **1:30 PM**.

## Afternoon Example

*   At **1:30 PM**, breaking down, then the market returns back to a bearish breaker there then it starts to go lower we have displacement here that could have been an entry there once more low taken here and now we have wealth of equal lows they are broken there.

## Trading Examples for Son

*   The speaker trains his son to see on a bearish day what's resting below sell side liquidity and create imbalance.

## Understanding Repetition

*   He is not discouraged and knows these things will repeat.

## Daily Goals

*   Best case scenario, there are three opportunities for him a day he's looking for just one of them to yield five points if he does he makes more than half of his weekly salary on that one trade.

## Trading Conditions

*   He's trying to do that once in the morning once in the afternoon he's taking a live trade in one or the other but once he gets one live trade he's trying to condition himself to do demo or he'll paper trade it whatever just watch it observe but he's not trying to do three trades a day initially i forced him into doing that i said take a trade in the morning take a trade in 8 30 take a trade at 9 30 take a trade at the afternoon and then take and also sometimes at three o'clock to four o'clock that market on closed macro that runs by the algorithm there's a little setup that forms most days of
I hope this helps.


Okay, here is the reorganized and restructured text based on your instructions. All details are included, and it has been formatted for improved readability and analysis:

# Mastering Algorithmic Trading: Specific Setups, Mindset, and Community

## Time-Specific Setups and Market Analysis

*   The speaker highlights specific times of day for trading setups.
*   These setups can be for both buy and sell opportunities, not just short setups.
*   **Actionable Insight:** The speaker suggests that the moments when these setups form are being "laid in your lap" during his videos.
*   **Challenge to Viewers:** He challenges viewers to review charts and confirm if these setups are indeed forming.

## Backtesting and Pattern Recognition

*   He emphasizes the importance of backtesting to identify recurring patterns.
*   **Objective:** Determine how often the market sets up in this manner and runs to liquidity above or below the marketplace.
*   **Quantifiable Goal:** Calculate how many setups offered five points at these key times of day over the past month, three weeks, two weeks, or one week.
*   **Call to Action:** "Once you see it and you back test and you pull out with example after example after example of how the market sets up like this and it runs to liquidity above or below the marketplace..."

## Financial Freedom and Skillset Acquisition

*   The speaker connects trading skills with financial freedom.
*   **Calculation:** He encourages viewers to do the math and see how even a small amount of success (e.g., "one quarter of that with one mini") can lead to significant gains.
*   **Liberation from Traditional Employment:** He envisions a future where a "job" is no longer a hindrance due to the financial independence gained from trading.
*   **Critique of Traditional Employment:** He criticizes the reliance on a boss's "generosity" in a 40-hour work week, with taxes deducted before the employee even receives their paycheck.
*   **Skillset Value:** "when you learn this skill set it removes fear"

## The Power of Skill: Overcoming Fear and Inflation

*   The speaker underscores the power of a valuable skillset in mitigating fear.
*   **Fear Reduction:** Learning this skillset removes fear of missing out, failure, and anxiety.
*   **Inflation Resistance:** This skillset can always outpace inflation.
*   **Examples:** The speaker provides examples of not being concerned about the price of gas or the cost of utilities because of the trading skillset.
*   **Lifestyle Affirmation:** Despite high gas prices, he will continue to drive his eight-cylinder Corvettes.

## Emphasizing Opportunity, Not Guarantee

*   The speaker clarifies that he's not promising viewers will get rich.
*   **Promise:** He *is* promising a skillset that offers the opportunity to do limitless feats, only bounded by imagination and effort.
*   **Critical Questions:**
    *   How much work are you putting into it?
    *   Who are you allowing to influence, discourage, or distract you?
    *   Are you seeing results?
    *   Do you feel scammed, or energized and thankful?

## Community and Transparency

*   He highlights the positive aspects of the trading community.
*   **Community Traits:** Thriving, energetic, happy, uplifted, and encouraging.
*   **Reassurance:** Members feel confident that they are not being taken advantage of.
*   **Transparency:** There's no upsell coming, allowing members to concentrate on learning.

## Captain of the Team: Guidance and Leadership

*   The speaker sees himself as the "captain of the team."
*   **Role:** Leading viewers in the right direction and helping them avoid the pain and struggles he experienced.
*   **Authenticity:** Real accounts, real money, and real decisions are involved.

## Embracing Discipline and Detachment

*   The speaker notes the abundance of opportunities that will arise.
*   **Paradoxical Fun:** One of the most enjoyable experiences will be seeing setups and choosing *not* to trade them.
*   **Rationale:** The trader has the discipline to say no because they're not influenced by fear or greed.
*   **Graduation:** Consistency at this level signifies graduation, independent thinking, and mastery over fear and greed.

## The Path to Mastery

*   The speaker emphasizes that this level of discipline is rare among traders on platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook.
*   **Process:** Reaching this level requires going through the necessary steps.
*   **Accessibility:** "It's not hiding from you I'm not making it hard for you..."
*   **Complete Understanding:** The speaker claims to have taught everything except money management (to be covered next week).

## The Inevitable Ups and Downs

*   The speaker acknowledges that success is not guaranteed every day.
*   **Action After Losses:** When a trade goes wrong, stop and avoid rushing to recover losses.
*   **Patience:** The next day may offer a similar opportunity, sometimes with "interest."
*   **Losses as Speed Bumps:** Losing trades are likened to getting a flat tire – an inconvenience that costs time and money but doesn't prevent reaching the destination.
*   **Destination:** Excellence.

## Growth and Resilience

*   The speaker stresses that excellence is achieved gradually.
*   **Process:** One step at a time, with occasional setbacks and detours.
*   **Key to Success:** Resuming forward progress after setbacks.
*   **When to Take a Break:** When feeling overwhelmed or wanting to quit.

*   **Call to Action:** Viewers are encouraged to indicate their interest in the comments section.
*   **Additional Request:** Viewers are also asked to share their experiences with the speaker's teachings on YouTube.
*   **Types of Feedback Sought:** Positive, negative, or neutral ( "waffle" ).
*   **Assurance of Respect:** The speaker promises to be respectful, even to negative feedback, and will use it to improve his teaching.

## Closing Remarks

*   The speaker wishes viewers a safe and enjoyable weekend.
*   He anticipates speaking to them again on Tuesday, "Lord willing."

# YouTube Channel Update: Focus on Reviews and Market Analysis

Okay, folks, welcome back! This marks the start of a new direction for the channel.

## Transitioning from Mentorship to Market Reviews

*   I'm wrapping up my mentorship teachings for the current model.
*   Moving forward, the channel will focus primarily on **reviews** and analysis of:
    *   **Index Futures**
    *   **Forex**
    *   **Commodities**
    *   ...and other applicable markets

### Clarifying Expectations: Not 30 Markets Daily!

I posted a short promo on **Twitter**, and everyone got excited, thinking I'd be covering 30 different markets every day. **That's NOT what I'm doing!** I want to give you a clearer idea of what we *will* be doing.

## Why I Shifted Away from Private Mentorship Videos

*   I used to create videos for a private mentorship group.
*   One of the main reasons I started this public channel is to **steer people away from buying old videos that are ultimately unhelpful.**
    *   When you buy *old* videos, you're getting market analysis for *that specific day*.
    *   It's not going to be as useful to you in the long run.
*   To combat the **profiting off of pirated videos**, I stopped making videos in my private group.
*   **Now, I make them publicly available here.**

### Student Reactions and My Perspective

*   Some of my students are upset that I did this.
*   Others understand and support my reasoning.
*   **I'm not going to debate the opinions** of those who support or don't support this change.
*   Here's how I see it:
    *   The people who have an issue with it are *probably the ones trying to sell pirated videos*.
    *   I've effectively removed their market.

### Beware of Scammers Selling Old Content!

*   **You're a fool** if you're going out there and buying videos from these Instagram guys who are selling my videos.
*   They have **ICT Mentorship** content from:
    *   2021
    *   2022
    *   2020
    *   2019
    *   ...all the way back to 2016!
*   **These videos won't help you because you weren't there when the content was being delivered.** It was designed for those who were being mentored *at that time*.
*   This is why I'm doing what I'm doing, and I'm explaining my motivations so you understand the reasons behind this shift.

## Focus on Real Trades and Relevant Markets

*   **I won't be covering a vast number of markets each day.**
*   **I'll be focusing on markets I've mentioned on Twitter or markets I've actually taken trades in.**
*   I won't be just talking about random markets that I have no real interest in, which is what you predominantly see on other platforms like:
    *   **YouTube**
    *   **Instagram**
    *   **Twitter**
    *   **Facebook**
    *   **Discord**
    *   ...and the list goes on and on.

## Canadian Dollar (USD/CAD) Trade Example: June 21, 2022

*   Today, one minute before 8:30 AM (EST), I apologize I was waiting for my phone to update its software and by the time I got back on to Twitter I had one minute left to type out everything that I posted.
*   I mentioned the Canadian Dollar because I know many of you are specifically interested in **Forex**, since that's what I'm primarily known for.
*   I've been focusing on stock index futures recently but I'm still engaged in Forex.
*   I did some live trades today and I'll share some of that with you.
*   I was covering the Canadian Dollar and outlining a particular idea...
*   We're going to use this example to illustrate the teaching on **daily bias**. (We'll get into that later in this video.)

### Analyzing the Charts: Daily and Hourly Timeframes

*   On the left-hand side, we have the **USD/CAD daily chart**.
*   On the right-hand side, we have the **hourly chart of the same pair (USD/CAD)**.
*   Last week, the market traded up and "bumped" the short-term high, creating a **daily high**.

#### Identifying the Swing High

*   **What formed on the daily chart after that high was hit?** *(Pause the video here if you need more time.)*
*   When the market ran into that old high, the next day it created a **lower high candle.**
*   This is what I call a **"swing high."**
    *   I'm not using a Williams Fractal on MT4.
    *   **I don't use MT4. This is not an MT4 platform.**
    *   Waiting for five candles means you've missed the opportunity.
*   This swing high at an old high did run it, not by much, but it did. That movement is shown clearly on the hourly chart.
*   The following day, it created a high with a lower high than the one that ran into the old high.
*   **We have a three-bar pattern:**
    *   One candle
    *   A lower candle to the left
    *   A lower candle to the right
*   **That's a swing high** - pretty simple stuff.
*   The next day, I expected the market to trade lower.

### Potential Resistance and the Bullish Order Block

*   The problem with this particular market is that yes, it's likely to trade down (and with the benefit of hindsight, I'm showing you this, but again, I tweeted about this beforehand).
*   At 8:29 AM EST, you can see that on my **Twitter feed**.
*   If it's dropping down, we have this down-close candle.
*   It could be met with some resistance, digging into this range of this down-closed candle, about half of its body.
*   Unsurprisingly, that's pretty much where we closed that candle on June 21, 2022.
*   The dashed line here is anchored to the **opening on this down-closed candle** because that's a **bullish order block**.
*   I'm not suggesting that we went into that to go higher, but as we started this down move, it's digging into this candle.
*   **That's going to be the impediment to a big, sudden, one big candle that would take us down into this area here and clear out this cell.**

### Hourly Chart Analysis: Manipulation and Fair Value Gaps

*   Looking at the hourly chart, last week we ran up into it, started drifting lower, with a **fair value gap**.
*   It rebalances to that, drops back down, and consolidates between this high and the low here.
*   It comes back in, drops once more, attacking the sell stops here, consolidates once more, and breaks, digging into that order block again. **(That's this level here.)**
*   Watch what happens:
    *   It goes into it overnight.
    *   Then it rallies.
*   This rally here is **ahead of the 8:30 AM news driver** on the economic calendar. *(You can find it on 4xfactory.com).*
*   **This movement is all manipulation** that takes us up into an imbalance here, a **fair value gap**, running a short-term high.
*   **Buy-side liquidity has been taken** when it runs here, anchored above this short-term high.

### 15-Minute and 5-Minute Charts: High-Impact News Driver

*   The chart on the left here is a **15-minute timeframe for USD/CAD**.
*   The chart on the right is a **5-minute chart.**
*   On the economic calendar, at 8:30 AM on June 21, 2022, we had a **high-impact news driver for core retail sales and medium-impact retail sales number**
*   Yellow events. I'm not interested in red or medium-impact, just high or medium-impact. Those are the news drivers I'm looking for.

### Analyzing the Price Movement

*   Looking at the price movement on the 5-minute chart, you can see that once we ran up initially at 7:00 AM:
    *   **What is 7:00 AM New York time?**
    *   **That's the beginning of my ICT New York Kill Zone!**
    *   It's extended to 10:00 AM when it's Forex.
*   From 7:00 AM to 10:00 AM local time, the market creates a short-term high and then runs above that.
*   **So we have buy-side liquidity taken.**
*   Then the market drops just below here...
*   ...But I want to have a **more meaningful displacement.**
*   **We want to see something that's more energetic.** This little "toe in the water" type thing here, that's not enough. We want to see it "fall in."
*   It drops down, taking that short-term low here.
*   **That's your shift in market structure, energetic displacement!**
*   **That candle is exactly when that news driver came out at 8:30 AM.**
*   All of this is **news-driver-related economic calendar manipulation**.
*   **The market is going to cause people to want to sell short and chase it lower.**
*   It creates a **fair value gap** here on the 5-minute chart, but there's also a **fair value gap** here.

### Waiting for the News: A Conservative Approach

*   Ahead of the news, you might be thinking, "Couldn't you have sold short here?"
*   **Yes, you could have.**
*   But the economic drivers that come at 8:30 AM could have sent it up higher and taken us into this area here.
*   **It's really a matter of waiting for the news to hit the market and *then* create the setup** that's a little more conservative.
*   There are times when it's so obvious that they're going to continue the move that starts ahead of the news driver.
*   But it takes a little more experience to find those setups and trust them.
*   I would rather you **use your demo account** to see these types of moves real-time.
*   **Wait for them to form, and then engage them with your demo.**
*   Don't try to forecast how much of a move it's going to further increase higher or lower once the news driver comes out or the news event hits the marketplace.
*   There are relative equal lows down here; that's your sell-side liquidity.

### Fair Value Gaps and Draw on Liquidity

*   We had this fair value gap formed after buy-side was taken here.
*   Now, this creates an area of buy-side liquidity.
*   Once this trades lower, we have this fair value gap, and then we have this fair value gap.
*   **It could run up into that level with the volatility.**
*   You have to make sure you define that with your risk management.
*   **The draw on liquidity is likely to pull down in here or into this fair value gap.**
*   We'll talk a little more about why that's the case, but eventually, it trades down into it, "bagged and tagged" sell-side liquidity.

### My Twitter Post and Market Expectations

*   The tweet I posted (again, you can see this at 8:29 AM, June 21, 2022, I just made it on Twitter) basically said:
    *   "Good morning, folks. USD/CAD is about to have some volatility. Note the sell-side and buy-side on your 5- and 15-minute charts."
    *   Sell-side is here. Buy-side would be here.
    *   "Study if it wants to run sell-side before buy-side, or rebounds to a discount."
    *   **What does that mean?**
    *   At the news driver release, it could go up and bump the buy-side, then dig in for the imbalance here (that's a discount) or run the sell-side out here.

### Manipulation and the New York Kill Zone

*   **All of this movement up since 5:00 AM New York local time, this was just ahead of that news driver here.**
*   They were building in a premium.
*   Then during the New York Kill Zone, it gave you the setup that I teach in this model, delivered to the fair value gap, and delivered to the sell-side liquidity pool.
*   **Between this high and that low here is equilibrium.**
*   We have to find a discount array below that if we're going short.
*   That's the fair value gap here.
*   You can take a partial there and target the sell-side liquidity, which you can see it does that as well here and here.
*   **I tweeted** (and I failed to include that tweet, I wish I would have put it in here now).
*   I mentioned how the market reacted here like that.
*   I stated, "That's the reason why you want to take partials, because you don't know if it's going to come all the way back up and then revisit the sphere of a gap and lose the opportunity to bank something when it goes into your first opportunity discount array when going short."

## Refining the Entry: A Four-Minute Chart Perspective

*   I've dropped down into a 4-minute chart and dimmed the fair value gap that I mentioned earlier:
    *   You could have taken that trade, but it would be ahead of the news driver and a little riskier.
    *   **You wait for the displacement.**
*   **The short-term low is taken, then we have a shift in market structure.**
*   **The imbalance would be between this low of this candle and the high of this candle in here.**
*   By itself, this is a rather elongated imbalance.
*   **All of this sell-side delivery is imbalanced, and there's not enough buy-side delivery.**
*   It's going to want to wait for the market to come back up in here.
*   **In Forex, there's no central measure of volume.**
*   **The algorithm that delivers price is going to want to come back up and overlap this down move and offer buyers an opportunity to get in on that.**
*   This is too much of a movement one-sided, so the market offers that rebalancing.

### Entry Strategy and Stop-Loss Placement

*   If that's the case, where in this range would we be looking for an entry, knowing that this fair value gap could be revisited?
*   **You're going to have to utilize that for your stop loss.**
*   **Your stop would have to be here.**
*   Doesn't matter where you're going short in between this low and this high, you have to define the risk with the stop here based on the model I'm teaching you.
*   Some of you are like, "Oh, this is too much."
*   Because if I went in at 1.2945 and I put my stop here, that's almost 12 pips; that's too much.
*   **No, it's not. It's all relative. You can scale.**
*   That's one of the benefits of Forex; it's very scalable.
*   Whereas, if you're trading futures, you're kind of stuck to whatever the contract size is, and you've got to either make it work, or you can't take the trade, or you're basically overleveraged, which is what you don't want to be doing.

### Fibonacci Retracement and Premium Price Point

*   If we look at that range from that high down to that low and drop a Fib on it, we're going to get a measurement of 50 here.
*   **That's our equilibrium price point.**
*   Really, we need price to get to that point or higher.
*   **By definition, we could be looking for a short here up to here.**
*   That would look like that.
*   **That's really the range that you'd be wanting to sell short in.**
*   You're not really risking a lot of pips, but you're defining the entry a little bit better.
*   Even though it goes above it a little bit, that's okay.
*   The bottom line is it eventually gets in sync.
*   **Watch the bodies of the candle support that premium high of the imbalance - beautiful delivery!**
*   Then it starts to break lower one more time.
*   A false little rally takes buy-side liquidity once more.
*   Then the real move starts to unfold.
*   Trades into the fair value gap here.
*   **Take partials** so that way if this reverses on you, you're paid.
*   Drops below a low where engineered sell-side liquidity would be.
*   Then digs into the sell-side liquidity over here.
*   **Your entry could be 1.2944, 1.2947 in that range; anywhere near is reasonable, it's acceptable.**
*   Obviously, the closer you get to this level, you may not have been filled.
*   It might just leave some of that open and then start to roll over.
*   As you can see here, it goes a little bit further; that's fine.
*   **That's why we have to utilize this level here for our stop loss based on the model's rules that I've taught in the 2022 YouTube Mentorship.**

## Summary of the Trade Setup

*   I have a 4-minute chart here with all the details shown:
    *   **Sell-side liquidity pool**
    *   Relative equal lows from the morning
    *   It rallies up, creates a high after running buy-side liquidity.
    *   It breaks down, consolidates, and gives a short-term swing low here with an energetic run lower at the high-impact news event at 8:30 AM.
    *   Rebalance. Stop goes here, and it rolls over.

## London Close and Algorithmic Time Windows

*   The move unfolds during the 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM timeframe.
*   **That timeframe, 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM, that's London Close.**
*   If you're looking for directional plays and you're in a trade, **you want to have about 80% of your trade off between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM** because usually (not all the time, but usually) that's when it creates the opposing end of the daily range.
*   **If it's creating the high of the session here, the low is likely to form between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM. That's algorithmic.**
*   There are some times (if there are news events) sometimes Canadian Dollar is influenced by crude oil numbers, and that would sometimes skew this time window from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM.
*   **On those days when there are crude oil inventory numbers coming out and I'm interested in trading the Loonie, I will trade with the expectation between 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and not have such a tight little window of 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM.**
*   I promise you, I have students for days and days and days and years and years now that will confirm that this has not just been form-fitted for this example.

# Daily Bias and E-Mini S&P Futures Contract Analysis

This section will delve into the concepts of daily bias, algorithmic time windows, and an analysis of the E-mini S&P futures contract.

## Algorithmic Time Windows: London Close Profit Taking

*   It has always been taught that **10:00 AM to 11:00 AM** in the morning is the **London Close profit-taking hour.**
*   Older teachings on this YouTube channel likely discuss this phenomenon.

## E-Mini S&P Futures Contract (September 2022)

*   This analysis focuses on the **E-mini S&P futures contract for September 2022.**
*   If using TradingView, the symbol is **ESU2022.**
*   The analysis begins with a **daily chart**.

## Understanding Daily Bias

*   **Daily bias** is a frequently requested topic.
*   While many seek a simple, foolproof approach (an "ABC, 123" method), the reality is more nuanced.
*   Many teachings, amplifications and revisits to this idea have already been done throughout the lessons and lectures and series found on this YouTube channel.

### Keys to Identifying Daily Bias

The following are the key principles to identifying daily bias.

*   **Everyday bias is unrealistic.**
    *   Predetermining a daily bias before the market opens is often incorrect.
*   The focus should be on determining the **likely weekly expansion.**
    *   Use a weekly chart to assess potential moves to old lows, old highs, imbalances above or below the market price, or a lack of movement due to impactful news in other markets.
*   Look for the **direction of an expansion move**, not the entire weekly range.
    *   The goal isn't to buy the weekly low and sell the weekly high, but rather to identify the primary direction of volatility.
*   In the beginning, simply determine if there will be a significant move higher or lower during the week.
*   **Identify obvious liquidity:** Look for liquidity below old lows, above old highs, or identify imbalances in price delivery from a top-down perspective.
    *   Start with the weekly chart, then move to the daily, four-hour, one-hour, and 15-minute charts.
    *   Finally, use 5-minute, 4-minute, 3-minute, 2-minute, and 1-minute charts to identify fair value gaps.
*   **Focus on days with high or medium impact calendar events only.**
    *   Consult the economic calendar for upcoming events that could influence the markets.
*   On days with impactful news, look for specific setups.
    *   Examples include:
        *   A run higher into a fair value gap.
        *   A run above a short-term high, taking out stops.
        *   A breakdown showing displacement, creating a fair value gap where one can go short.
*   Seek these setups during intraday kill zones, aligning with economic calendar events.
*   There's no need to know the bias every single trading day.
*   Focus on "sweet spots" where conditions align favorably.
*   A move may occur prior to the economic calendar event; this will simply be a missed opportunity, focus on other pairs or something else one can trade with.
*   Trading every single day increases the likelihood of losing trades.
*   It's crucial to know when *not* to trade.

### Planning Trades with the Model

*   Use the economic calendar to identify high-impact or medium-impact news events.
*   Determine the kill zone and the expected weekly expansion (high or low).
*   Journaling these setups will reveal repeating patterns.
*   The best setups often occur when calendar events are in play and originate around the same time.
*   Trading is not an Olympic sport; there are no gold medals for over-trading.

## Hourly Chart Analysis: S&P 500

*   The hourly chart shows the S&P trading down, leaving relative equal lows (with one slightly lower).
*   The price action displayed "whipsawing," with both sides of the marketplace (buy side and sell side) being impacted.
*   Price action like this is usually FOMC or some kind of rate announcement type event.

### Key Observations

*   Whenever such price action is observed, ignore that wick as well as all of the wicks.
*   The real range is from the most recent swing high to the swing low.
*   The market drops down, creating this low runs a little bit lower.

### Range Equilibrium

*   The concern is with the range from the swing high to the swing low, the **equilibrium is at the 50% level.**
*   If the market is going higher, it will target a **premium**.

### Fair Value Gap and Imbalance

*   The imbalance here is not interesting because it overlaps with that equilibrium 50 level of the swing high to swing low.
*   Ideally, the market will dig into a premium and reach to a fair value gap in a premium market.

### Pause the Video

Pause the video and look for what you can identify, based on the understanding and experience learning under me so far.

## 15-Minute Time Frame Analysis

*   At midnight New York local time, there was a fair value gap, pull a shoulder block.
*   The last three down-closed candles constitute a consecutive order block.
*   The market digs into the order block with the fair value gap during the London session.
*   A rally ensues, creating a fair value gap.
*   Relative equal highs are formed ahead of the New York session.
*   The market drops down, entering the fair value gap and the last down-closed candle (bull shoulder block).

### London Open and Directional Bias

*   London creates the high or the low most of the time, around 70% of the time.
*   If the directional bias is correct, it is likely that the low is pricing in the daily low.
*   A retracement into the New York session trades into an order block and closes up the fair value gap.
*   Then, the market rallies a little bit and drops back down into the fair value gap, creating optimal trade entry.

### New York AM Session

*   The New York AM session begins from 8:30 AM to 11:00 AM (specific to index futures).
*   The upper level is the upper level in the fair value gap on the hourly chart.
*   The lower level is the lower level on the hourly fair value gap.
*   These levels act as targets and a draw on liquidity.

### Market Dynamics and Signals

*   The market runs from the fair value gap (low) to the fair value gap (high) on the hourly chart after clearing buy-side liquidity on the 5-minute chart.
*   The market is trading down into a higher time frame, then a lower time frame, and finally another lower time frame.
*   These moves are supported by down-closed candles within a bullish bias.
*   Fair value gaps are closed as the market moves higher.
*   Candlestick patterns alone provide sufficient information, eliminating the need for indicators, moving averages, etc.
*   Everything is being shown here in price action relative to time and price.
*   The market starts with a run from this low with a lower low.
*   What took sell-side has been taken.

I hope this meets your requirements! I aimed for meticulous accuracy and detail.

# E-Mini S&P 500 Futures Contract Analysis and Intermarket Relationships

This analysis focuses on intraday trading setups, intermarket relationships, and the influence of economic calendar events on market bias.

## Intraday Price Action Analysis

*   The market initially retraces to a short-term discount, relative to a recent low-to-high price range.
*   Following this, a rally occurs, and as the market consolidates around 9:30 AM, it starts moving upward, targeting buy-side liquidity.
*   The low of the fair value gap (FVG) on the hourly chart and the high of the fair value gap on the hourly chart all act as liquidity draws, with three targets being hit.
*   **Zoomed-in Chart (8:30 AM - 9:30 AM Session):**
    *   The market makes a lower low into an order block.
    *   A short-term shift in market structure occurs.
    *   Price comes back down, creating an imbalance (fair value gap).
    *   These levels are identified based on a 5-minute chart analysis.

## Order Block and Fair Value Gap Setup

*   Inside the fair value gap, the price action is analyzed further.
*   A down-close candle represents an **order block** within the fair value gap.
*   A buying opportunity exists there because a stop-running event has already occurred.
*   The market reacted off the order block and is within the fair value gap.
*   After a rally, another fair value gap is created.
*   The last down-closed candle offers another buying opportunity.
*   Buy-side liquidity resting above acts as the initial draw on liquidity (first partial target).
*   Potential exists to pyramid the position as the market moves higher.
*   Analyzing the low-to-high range reveals the **equilibrium (50% level)**.
*   The market retraces into a discount before the rally.
*   Consolidation at 9:30 AM precedes the market takeoff.
*   This setup demonstrates an early opportunity: a discount into a fair value gap followed by a rally.

## Time and Price Analysis

*   Trading into an hourly discount creates a short-term discount relative to the recent low to high.
*   The market rallies, then retraces to an order block and fair value gap discount before rallying again.
*   The consolidation ahead of 9:30 AM makes it unlikely that the market will retrace to take out the low.
*   The nearest fair value gap has already been rebalanced.
*   The recent low took out a previous low, completing the framework and narrative.

## Intermarket Analysis: Dollar CAD and E-Mini S&P Futures

*   The analysis considers the 8:30 AM news event affecting the Dollar/CAD pair.
*   If Dollar/CAD is expected to move down to a discount or run sell-side liquidity, the bias is bearish.
*   A bearish bias on Dollar/CAD suggests a **risk-on** scenario.
*   In a risk-on environment, stock indices (S&P, NASDAQ) and foreign currencies tend to rally.
*   Because Dollar/CAD had the high-impact news event, focus is placed on it to determine the morning session's bias.
*   Lower prices on Dollar/CAD correlate with a weaker dollar and stronger foreign currencies, making it easier for the E-mini S&P futures to rally.
*   This intermarket relationship aligns with the previously described price action analysis.

## Visual Confirmation and Trade Refinement

*   A short-term shift in market structure follows a stop hunt and retracement to a discount.
*   Buying within the fair value gap targets initial buy-side liquidity.
*   As the analysis shifts to a 3-minute chart, it shows a rally creating a fair value gap that slightly overshoots.
*   The market then rallies further, reaching the high of the hourly fair value gap.
*   The upward movement in the S&P coincides with Dollar/CAD trading down into its discount around the 9:30 AM period.

## Practical Trade Application

*   For forex traders, selling Dollar/CAD short aligns with the risk-on sentiment.
*   For those who don't trade forex, the long position in E-mini S&P futures is the analogous trade.
*   Pyramiding opportunities can be sought as the market breaks short-term highs.
*   The 9:30 AM opening sees consolidation followed by a rally that creates a fair value gap.
*   Buying at 3741.75 as the market retraces provides an entry point.
*   Partial profit-taking can occur at logical levels based on higher time frame charts.
*   A portion of the position can be held for a potential continuation into the afternoon session (1:30 PM to 4:00 PM New York time).

## Conclusion and Additional Intermarket Insights

*   Intermarket relationships and economic calendar events help define market bias.
*   The analysis focuses on the synergy between Dollar/CAD and E-mini S&P futures based on risk-on/risk-off dynamics.
*   **Risk-On:** Foreign currencies, index futures, and stocks move higher; the dollar moves lower.
*   **Risk-Off:** The dollar moves higher, and other assets move lower.
*   Use the economic calendar to identify high-impact news drivers.
*   When Euro/USD has a high-impact news event, compare Euro/USD to Pound/USD for correlation.
*   Look for SMT (Smart Money Technique) divergences to determine the preferred pair.
*   If, for example, both pairs move lower before the Euro news event, and Pound/USD fails to make a lower low, buy Pound/USD.
*   In the case of Dollar/CAD, focus specifically on that pair due to the economic calendar's indication of volatility there.
*   Analyze currency pairs for correlation; if a currency fails to make a lower low intraday during a risk-on environment, buy that currency.
*   The money management discussion on Thursday will complete the 2022 mentorship teachings, with continuous market reviews on the YouTube channel thereafter.
*   Look for S&P-related or forex-related analyses moving forward.

Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining all original details, context, and nuances while enhancing readability and structure:

# **2022 ICT Mentorship: Final Review and Discussion (June 23, 2022)**

**Video URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XhDi5GoNUI

## **I. Introduction**

*   Welcome back to the final review and discussion of the free **2022 ICT Mentorship** on YouTube.
*   This session is recorded on **June 23rd, 2022**.
*   We are analyzing the **E-mini S&P September 2022 Contract**.
*   The initial overview will be based on the **hourly chart**.

## **II. Morning Analysis and Expectations**

*   **Initial Expectation:**
    *   Looking for increased volatility around **Fed Chair Powell's** speech at **10:00 AM**.
*   **Actual Outcome:**
    *   Volatility was lower than anticipated.
    *   Observed a scenario where **ICT's** initial expectation was not met. This provides a valuable real-time learning opportunity.
*   **Key Benefits of Live Analysis:**
    *   Demonstration of how analysis, calls, viewpoints, perspectives, or opinions may not always materialize as expected.
    *   Understanding the proper application of **time of day** in trading.
    *   Illustrating how time of day can prevent incorrect setups.
*   **Framework for the Day:**
    *   **Sell-side Liquidity:** Market initially dropped and took out sell-side liquidity.
    *   **Rally:** Market then rallied upwards.
    *   **Buy-side Liquidity:** Initial target was the **3805 level**.
    *   **Expectation at 3805:** Anticipated a potential short formation at that level if reached.
    *   **Actual Result:** Market went just above a short-term high but failed to reach 3805 and then moved lower.
    *   **Trade Outcome:** A trade was stopped out at +2 points (covering expenses). Lower timeframe analysis will follow.

## **III. 15-Minute Timeframe Analysis**

*   Normally, the charts would be presented blank for independent analysis. However, for this final session, the charts will be pre-marked to focus on the core teachings.
*   This marks the end of the teachings for this specific model of the mentorship.
*   **Number of Videos:** 41 videos in total (40 after removing the introductory video).
*   **10:00 AM Powell Event:** The market initially ran up following the event, taking out the buy-side liquidity.

### **A. New York Index AM Session (Killzone: 8:30 AM - 11:00 AM)**

*   The primary target was the **3805 level**.
*   A long position was taken, anticipating a run up to that level and a subsequent reversal.
*   This scenario did not unfold as anticipated.
*   While trades *can* be taken after 11:00 AM, the focus is on adhering to the established rules to highlight opportunities that may be missed by strict adherence.
*   Acknowledging that mistakes happen: Witnessed an incorrect assessment today with minimal consequences.
*   Market ran above the short-term buy-side liquidity but broke down instead of reaching the 3805 target.
*   A public announcement was made on Twitter about being uninterested and unsure about the market's direction due to approaching the noon hour.
*   A trade was taken and resulted in a +2 point outcome (breakeven).
*   **Lesson:** When high-impact news events (like Fed Chair speeches) don't align with initial expectations, it's often best to step away and re-evaluate later.
*   The decision was made to avoid trading further in the morning session leading up to noon.
*   A plan was made to reassess the market during lunch hour and after, around **1:30 PM**.

### **B. Fair Value Gaps and Liquidity Runs**

*   A fair value gap was observed on the 15-minute chart.
*   The market eventually ran down, taking out sell-side liquidity and overrunning the initial fair value gap.
*   **Reasoning:** This occurred because a larger fair value gap existed. If price trades above the first gap, it's likely to target the larger one.
*   This movement occurred during the New York lunch hour (until 1:00 PM), culminating in the session's low after closing within the fair value gap.

### **C. New York Index PM Session (1:30 PM - 4:00 PM)**

*   The afternoon session (or **PM session**) showed a willingness to move higher.
*   A short-term shift in market structure was observed (detailed in the lower timeframe analysis).
*   The market rallied back up to the initially targeted **3805 level**.
*   **Original Expectation:** The plan was for the market to run above 3805, sell off to a discount area, and then create a larger run beyond 3805.
*   However, the market failed to reach 3805, falling into a lower area.
*   Once the market broke below a certain point, short positions were avoided due to the approaching lunch hour and potential consolidation.
*   A stop run during lunch hour was observed, running below the previously established low and into a deeply discounted fair value gap.
*   The market then rallied upward.

## **IV. Five-Minute Chart Analysis**

*   The five-minute chart will be examined to analyze the specifics of the previously mentioned price action.
*   The initial poke above (buy-side liquidity) occurred inside the discussed area.
*   A two-minute fair value gap was identified (mentioned on Twitter as it formed).
*   The market rallied after the fair value gap, and a tweet was prepared to announce a potential short position targeting a run down to a specific level. This setup never materialized.
*   The market eventually broke lower after the lunch hour closed at **1:00 PM**.
*   Waiting until **1:30 PM** allowed for cleaner price action.
*   The market rallied, then dropped back into an order block/fair value gap on the five-minute chart.
*   A shift in market structure occurred.
*   A small return to a fair value gap was created, followed by another rally.
*   Eventually, the short-term high of the day was taken out, leading to a run to the 3805 level targeted earlier on Twitter.

## **V. Detailed Five-Minute Chart (Morning Session)**

*   Zoomed-in view of the morning session.
*   Buy-side liquidity run.
*   Breakdown and displacement.
*   Small fair value gap.
*   A run down into a fair value gap.
*   Reversal back into an imbalance.
*   Run down to the low end of the fair value gap, marking the session's low at **1:00 PM** (end of lunch hour).

## **VI. Two-Minute Chart Analysis**

*   This chart highlights the fair value gap that was drawn attention to live on Twitter.
*   The market came down into the fair value gap.
*   The intention was to go long, targeting a run to **3805**.
*   The market started to run, taking out buy-side liquidity.
*   While buy-side liquidity was expected to be a draw, the specific target was still 3805.
*   If the market had come back down into the fair value gap once more and *then* rallied above the short-term high, it would have presented a nice opportunity to "pay the trader" (secure profits after tweeting about the setup). This didn't occur.
*   Acknowledging potential criticism:
    *   It's easy to armchair quarterback a trade.
    *   The commentary is presented in real time.
    *   Being wrong is acceptable and not detrimental.
    *   General performance is considered better than average.
*   Upon returning to the fair value gap, the trade was stopped out because the stop-loss was strategically positioned to avoid weathering a deeper retracement.
*   **Key Takeaway:** The market traded down into the fair value gap, showing good movement initially. It then came back down, completely closing the gap.

    *This action caused a feeling of confidence that a run to 3805 was coming. If it was going to go above the short-term high, then 3805 should have easily been reached.*

*The market dropped back down and didn't quite take out the short-term low with meaningful displacement.*

    *   Because of this lack of displacement, the existing fair value gap was not considered a valid trading opportunity. The lack of a run below that low meant it would not have been a participation in that Fair Value Gap.

*   Closing up shop was the chosen action.
*   If a movement similar to the initial breakdown candle had occurred *below* the short-term low, a short position aiming for the low at noon might have been considered.
*   The goal was to avoid overwhelming the audience with excessive commentary or causing unnecessary worry.
*   Awareness of the potential impact on viewers taking live trades based on commentary.
*   **Recommendation:** Practice in a demo account before trading live.
*   Another fair value gap was present.
*   The market traded up into that gap, closing perfectly, and then ran down to the top of the fair value gap on the 15-minute timeframe.
*   One more small bounce occurred before the market rolled over and moved deeper into the fair value gap.

## **VII. Afternoon Session (PM)**

*   The bulk of the discussion will focus on the afternoon session.
*   Framing of risk management and stop-loss management will be central to completing the model.
*   The rules for risk management and stop placement are static and consistent, ensuring clarity on stop placement and risk amount.
*   Trades have been shown where stops aren't being actively moved, but partials are being taken.
*   The specific rules will be provided to help trust in taking partials and managing positions without fear of being stopped out.
*   Stop-losses are there to do their job and should be respected.
*   It's more important to continuously assess price action, bullishness/bearishness, and institutional order flow than to be overly concerned about being stopped out.
*   This doesn't minimize the importance of respecting risk, which is achieved by using a hard stop-loss.
*   Trading without a hard stop-loss implies an unjustified belief in being right, with a plan to "figure it out later" if wrong, which is undesirable.
*   The two-minute chart shows the afternoon (PM) session for index futures.
*   The market traded down and hit the low at **1:00 PM**, then started to rally.
*   A short-term shift in market structure occurred.
*   **Key Time of Day: 1:30 PM**
*   The market traded back down into an order block (last down-closed candle).
*   A fair value gap existed but was not marked to avoid clutter.
*   The market traded down to an order block after a shift in market structure, following a close within a 15-minute timeframe fair value gap.
*   The market then traded into an **Optimal Trade Entry (OTE)**.
*   **OTE:** Fair value gap with an order block.
*   Optimal Trade Entry is the flagship ICT pattern.
*   This is where one could go long, expecting price to reach for specific objectives (imbalance, buy-side liquidity targets).
*   Observed the market marching higher.
*   A run occurred from the OTE to the short-term high.
*   A fair value gap then facilitated a run up to the **3805 level**.
*   Being long in the PM session was the chosen direction.
*   The goal is to provide the salient information to close out the mentorship and demonstrate the proper application of the teachings.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining all original details, context, and nuances while enhancing readability and structure:

# **Risk Management, Stop Placement, and Trade Example**

## **I. Introduction**

*   This section will cover **stop placement** and **risk management**, including a working example.
*   A live trading example from today will be shown to illustrate these concepts.
*   Current live account balance: **$1,975**.
*   The lesson will cover how to determine **risk management**, **stop-loss placement**, and **when to move your stop**.

## **II. Five-Minute Chart Analysis: Optimal Trade Entry (OTE) Example**

*   Zooming in on the **five-minute chart** to analyze a specific **fair value gap**.
*   **Key Questions:**
    *   Did the market trade down into the fair value gap?
    *   Does it show a willingness to go higher?
    *   Is there a short-term shift in market structure?
    *   Is there a down-close candle to the left (bullish order block)?
*   **Optimal Trade Entry (OTE)**: Bullish order block where the market drops down.
    *   Represents a 62% to 70% retracement level (less than equilibrium relative to the high and low).
*   **Hypothetical Trade Setup:**
    *   **Limit order to buy (long)**: **3754.75** (one quarter point less than the candle's low).
    *   **Stop-loss:** **3745.75** (using the low), creating approximately **9 points of risk**.
*   **Profit Objective:**
    *   **First Target:** The high of the identified candle, which is **3780.25** approximately **25.5 points of potential profit per contract**.
*   **Risk/Reward Ratio:**
    *   **Risking 9 points** to potentially **make 25.5 points**.
    *   Better than a **2.5R trade** (risking one dollar to make two dollars and fifty cents).
*   **Trade Progression:**
    *   The focus is on the initial run from entry to the first target.
    *   Subsequent opportunities may arise, creating additional trades (e.g., a run from the first target to a higher level).
    *   Trade management will be discussed in the risk management section.

## **III. Risk Management: Determining Lot Size**

*   There are free tools available online (Google search) for **lot size calculators**.
*   These calculators determine appropriate lot size based on:
    *   Account size.
    *   Risk percentage.
    *   Stop-loss size.
*   These tools provide information on leverage (Forex) or lot size (futures).
*   Acknowledging that some individuals prefer personalized guidance from an educator/mentor, but the basics can be found through online searches.
*   Providing a specific example to illustrate risk management principles.

### **A. Risk Management Example: $10,000 Account**

*   **Scenario:** Trading index futures with a **$10,000 account**.
*   **Risk Tolerance:** Aiming to risk **1% per trade**.
*   **Calculation:**
    *   $10,000 * 0.01 = $100 (This is the total dollar amount at risk).
*   **Stop-Loss Size:**
    *   Calculated at **9 points** (based on the hypothetical entry of 3754.75 and stop at 3745.75).
*   **Contract Sizing:**
    *   **Divide risk tolerance by stop-loss size**: $100 / 9 = 11 (approximately).
    *   **E-mini S&P Futures Contract (Multiplier: $50 per point)**: $50 divided into 11 is not possible (cannot trade a mini contract).
    *   **Micro E-mini Futures Contract (Multiplier: $5 per point)**: Micro lot is the suitable choice. $5 divided into 11 approximately equals two, thus **two micro lots** may be traded.

*   **Commission Consideration:**
    *   Risk management examples typically do not factor in commission.
    *   Commissions are acknowledged as costs that should be considered separately.
*   **Example Outcome (Two Micro Lots):**
    *   Buying at **3754.75** and risking **9 points**, results in **$90 risk** (under 1% of the account).
    *   Targeting **25.5 points** yields **$255 profit** (two micro lots at $5 per point = $10 per point).
    *   Approximately a **2.25% return** (risking 1% to make 2.25% on an intraday scalp).
*   **Potential for Multiple Trades:**
    *   The example provides a single trade scenario.
    *   Subsequent opportunities may lead to additional profits (e.g., short positions).
*   **Achieving 1-3-5% Daily Returns:**
    * Intraday price swings provides the potential to make returns of such sizes, however one must take caution of over-excitement and the thought of trading every fluctuation that arises.
*   **Compounding Effects:**
    *   Making 1% per day compounding returns is impactful over time.
    *   **Common Misconception:** Assuming 1% daily equals 5% weekly and 20% monthly.
    *   **Reality:** 1% daily compounding (Monday-Friday, four weeks) leads to approximately **22% per month**.
    *   **Comparison to Professional Money Managers:** 12-15% annual returns are considered excellent in the professional money management world.
*   **Realism of 1% Daily:**
    *   Unrealistic expectation for new traders, however can be done easily on average as a seasoned trader.
    *   1% daily average is equivalent to one trade a week netting a 5% profit.
    *   It is unreasonable to force a trade each day when the market provides the opportunity.
    *   It is important to find setups where you can frame and make 5% on one setup.
*   **Potential for Increased Returns (2% Risk):**
    *   Framework the risk for one limit order to be buying at **3754.75** and a stop-loss as explained.
    *   A second order can be placed the same way but the profit objective is for the short-term high here (Target 1) and the other target for the daily range (Target 2).

*   **Potential Returns with Increased Risk**
    *   One trade would close at the short-term high (Target 1) banking 2.25% and the other trade could run through Target 1 to get to Target 2 and make 4.5% more on the second position.
    *   With this example, a trader could potentially make six and three-quarter percent a day with two orders on one trade.
*   **Funded Account Challenges:**
    *   Numbers are achievable if you learn how to trade and follow what is being taught.

## **IV. Drawdown Management**

*   **Definition of Drawdown:** Account reduction from the starting balance or after equity increases.
*   **Importance of Management:** Prevents account blowing.
*   **Scenario: Hypothetical Loss**
    *   Taking a hypothetical trade at **3754.75** and getting stopped out.
    *   In this case, the next trade should be half of 1% risk due to the psychological and emotional impacts of losing.
*   **Reducing Risk After a Loss:**
    *   Mitigates revenge trading and over-leveraging.
    *   Promotes patience and avoids forcing trades.
    *   Reduce the risk and make 50% back before returning to full 1% risk.
*   **Consequences of a Second Loss (Half of 1%):**
    *   Next trade risk is reduced to **one-quarter of 1%** (the lowest allowable).
*   **Benefits of Reduced Risk:**
    *   Limits the number of trades, and ultimately preserves capital in a losing streak.
    *   Avoids the steep falling-off-a-cliff equity curve.
*   **Common Pitfalls (Avoid):**
    *   Doubling up after a loss (increasing risk to 2%).
    *   Failing to use a stop-loss or moving the stop-loss to open up more risk.
*   **Example of Drawdown:**
    *   Taking a 1% loss, then a 0.5% loss, then a 0.25% loss results in a total drawdown of 1.75%.
    *   Much easier to recover from compared to larger losses.
*   **Starting with a Shoestring Budget:**
    *   If you are short on funds, learn the skill set.
    *   Find partners that'll come in with you and trade with other people's money.
*   **Funded Accounts as a Venture:**
    *   Provides a way to go in with a very small amount of money.
    *   Walk right into anyone's funded account challenges.
    *   Secure whatever size account you're trying to go for.
*   **Trading Soberly:**
    *   Aim for 10% to 15% per month.
    *   Do not try to get rich quick.
    *   Knowing how to manage the drawdown will keep you from blowing your account.
    *   Controls equity drawdown.
*   **One Percent Loss and Subsequent Trades:**
    *   Everyone has losing trades and series of losing trades.
    *   It is reasonable to take losses and one must know how to come back from them.
*   **Avoid Using No Stop Loss:**
    *   Sudden drops can lead to large psychological blows.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining all original details, context, and nuances while enhancing readability and structure:

# **Drawdown Management, Stop Management, and Trading Psychology**

## **I. Managing Drawdown: A Shift in Perspective**

*   The emotional turmoil of a **drawdown** can feel like a personal attack.
    *   You may feel embarrassed, ashamed, and desperate to recoup your losses immediately.
    *   This mindset equates losses to failure.
*   **Professional money managers**, in contrast, prioritize:
    *   Managing expectations.
    *   Maintaining discipline.
*   **Emotional Regulation:**
    *   They are forbidden from trading when highly charged or emotional.
    *   This is a critical component of overall **risk management**.
    *   The focus is on quelling the desire to immediately recover losses.

## **II. The "Infantile" Desire for Instant Recovery**

*   The intense need to "have it back" after a loss is characterized as "infantile".
    *   This is not intended as an insult, but a direct observation.
    *   It stems from wanting your "toy" (money) back instantly.
*   **Reframing Drawdown:**
    *   Professional money managers view drawdown as a **loan** that will generate **interest**.
    *   Banks don't lament lending money; they expect returns over time.
*   **Long-Term View:**
    *   The goal is not to eliminate drawdown completely, but to understand it as a temporary state.
    *   A long-term career is not defined by the last five trades, weeks, months, or even years.

## **III. Overcoming the Urge to Quit**

*   A short-sighted perspective makes it easy to quit after a loss.
    *   Focusing solely on recent losses or a single trade creates undue pressure.
    *   Each trade becomes a "make-or-break" event.
*   **Signals of Distress (and a Cry for Help):**
    *   Public declarations of quitting on social media are often cries for encouragement.
    *   If truly quitting, one would simply disappear from the scene.
*   **Analogy to Relationships:**
    *   A woman threatening to leave may be testing the partner's reaction.
    *   True departures happen silently.

## **IV. The Inevitability of Losses: Paying Your "Tax on Success"**

*   Accept that trading involves periods of difficulty.
*   Losing trades are unavoidable, regardless of strategy or mentor.
*   **Monetary losses are a "tax on success"** that every trader must pay.
*   **No one is exempt**, regardless of perceived skill or talent.
*   The market (the "ferryman") will demand its toll (losing trades).
*   **Controlling the Damage:**
    *   You have the power to limit the impact of losses through proper risk management.
    *   Adhere to your calculated risk parameters.
    *   Avoid trading "willy-nilly" without a defined stop-loss.
*   **Danger of Vague Exit Strategies:**
    *   Saying "I know when I want to get out" without a hard stop is a sign of being unprepared.
    *   It indicates a lack of a solid trading plan.

## **V. Stop-Loss Placement and Drawdown Recovery**

*   **Hard Stop is Necessary:**
    *   The trading model requires a hard stop-loss.
    *   Getting stopped out is a protective measure.
*   **Following a Loss:**
    *   The trader's job is to analyze and adapt to the market.
    *   The next trade must be managed with reduced risk.
    *   The task is to incrementally recover from the drawdown.
*   **Example Scenario:**
    *   If a 2% risk trade is lost, the next trade's risk is reduced to 1%.
    *   Using the previous hypothetical entry (3754.75) and stop (3745.75):
        *   2% risk would equate to four micro lots ($20 per point, 9 points risk).
        *   1% risk would follow the earlier example.
*   **Stop-Loss Considerations:**
    *   The number of points/pips required for the stop-loss varies per trade.
    *   Consider the impact on risk management.
    *   Excessive drawdown may eventually limit even micro lot trading.

## **VI. Avoiding the Trap of Overconfidence**

*   Resist the temptation to increase risk after a winning trade.
    *   The allure of quick profits (e.g., 3% risk leading to a 15% gain) is dangerous.
    *   The "what if I do that every day?" mentality leads to ruin.
    *   Avoid the temptation to trade excessively (morning, afternoon, London sessions).
*   **Focus on Low Threshold Objectives:**
    *   Work your way up gradually.
    *   Trading success is about longevity, controlled risk, and impeccable risk management.
*   **Losing Trades are Inevitable (and Insignificant in the Long Run):**
    *   A losing trade is simply a tax on success.

## **VII. Stop Management: Tactical Stop-Loss Movement**

*   **Stop Management** concludes the teachings, but reviews and topical studies will continue.
*   All the necessary information has been provided for success.
*   Future lessons will refine and amplify existing knowledge.
*   **Moving Your Stop-Loss:**
    *   Determine your entry point and target range (e.g., 3754.75 to 3780.25, a 25.5-point range).
    *   Calculate key levels within that range.
*   **Stop-Loss Adjustment Guidelines:**
    *   **Price moves 50%** (12.5 points in this example) above the entry:
        *   Move the stop-loss up **25%** of the original range between the entry and stop.
        *   This provides a small reduction in risk and a "feel-good moment".
    *   **Price moves 75%** of the expected targeted range:
        *   Move the stop-loss to **break even**.
*   **Focus on Market Dynamics:**
    *   Instead of worrying about getting stopped out, monitor:
        *   Whether the price is still moving towards your target.
        *   Support from down-closed candles.
        *   Energy after short-term sweeps of liquidity (taking out short-term sell stops).
        *   Re-accumulation at fair value gaps.
*   **Confirmation of Right Side of Market:**
    *   These factors indicate you are on the right side of the trade.
    *   Hold the position until the target is hit.

## **VIII. Partial Profit Taking (For Higher Leverage)**

*   **Competition-Level Leverage (3%-4.5% Risk):**
    *   Consider taking partial profits along the way.
    *   **Example:** Take something off the table once the trade moves 15-20 points in your favor.
*   **Personalization is Key:**
    *   Develop rules and strategies that fit your unique trading style and personality.
    *   Avoid rigid, inflexible rules.

## **IX. Concluding Thoughts: Perseverance and Self-Belief**

*   Congratulations to those who have diligently studied and back-tested the material.
*   For those still struggling, keep practicing.
*   **Timeline for Mastery:**
    *   Within six months, you'll see things you never saw before.
    *   Within one full year, you'll understand what you're looking for.
*   **Success is Not Guaranteed, But Understanding Is:**
    *   It doesn't mean you'll trade every day or always know the bias.
    *   It doesn't eliminate losing trades.
    *   It means you'll know what you're doing, even during setbacks.
*   **Faith in the Model:**
    *   Even with short-term hardships, you'll maintain faith because you know the patterns repeat more often than they fail.
*   **Challenge:**
    *   Determine whether that statement (patterns repeating more than failing) is true for yourself.
*   Until next time, good luck and good trading.
