    *   Pre-market levels were discussed and what levels I'd be looking for.
    *   8:20 AM (New York Time): Bicycle Depot (specific levels to watch for market movement). All the levels down here the market going to draw into.

## Twitter Usage in 2023: Alerts & Notifications

### Shift in Strategy

*   Historically, very active on Twitter.
*   **2023 Focus**: Primarily for alerts to prompt viewers to check YouTube content.
    *   "Hey, look at this!" alerts related to market events or schedule changes.
*   **No More Twitter Spaces:** All podcasts are discontinued.

### Importance of Notifications

*   **Enable Notifications**: To receive immediate alerts about:
    *   Real-time market events
    *   YouTube schedule changes (e.g., live session alterations due to emergencies).
*   **Consequences of Not Subscribing**: You may miss important updates.

## Chart Setup & Market Analysis Example

### TradingView Chart Configuration

*   **Maximizing Chart Space**: The following steps will maximize the chart:
    1.  Click on the button to bring up the toolbar (usually at the bottom of the screen).
    2.  Maximize the chart.
*   **Toolbar Contents**: Includes a favorite list of commonly-used tools (not extensive).

### Example: Friday's Trading Analysis

*   **Initial Expectation**: Anticipated an inside day on Friday relative to Thursday's range.

*   **Rationale**: Last trading day of the year, low likelihood of a significant move.
    *   Institutional funds likely on the sidelines, squaring positions.
    *   No Santa Claus rally as predicted.
    *   Market consolidated, remaining in a small range.

*   **Key Reference Points**: Thursday's high and low served as the primary boundaries.

*   **Friday's Performance**: Lower high than Thursday's, higher low than Thursday's.
        *   Confirmation that we would be inside the range and that it would be an inside day.

### Lower Time Frame Analysis

*   **Four-Hour Chart**:
    *   **Focus:** Identifying liquidity and inefficiencies.
    *   Old Lows: Sell-side liquidity (sell stops).
    *   Old Highs: Buy-side liquidity (buy stops).
    *   Buy Side Imbalance Cell Side Inefficiency: one candle passes through the high and low of others with no candles in between.
    *   Liquidity Void: Actual gaps between candles' highs and lows.

*   **Example: Liquidity Void Interaction**
    *   Market initially goes above the short-term high, targeting a liquidity void.
    *   Pass through down, so to balance it out, it has to go through it.

    *   Consequent Encouragement: Comes up into it halfway.
    *   Full Return: Comes back up one more time

    *   Balanced Price Range: Formed after the market moves up and down into the range. This will be denoted with a heavy dashed line.

*   **Hourly Chart**:
    *   **Analysis**:
        *   Liquidity Pools: Previous day's low (sell-side), Thursday's high (buy-side).

    *   **Narrative vs. Bias**: Narrative is how the day will trade, bias is which direction you are trading.
        *   Narrative - Game plan for what it *should* do based on experience.
        *   Roadmap: Articulates potential routes from point A to point B.
        *   Adapting: Manual intervention can impact the algorithm.

*   **15-Minute Chart**:
    *   **Analysis**: Review the liquidity void behavior on the 15-minute chart.
    *   **Tip for New Viewers**: If this analysis is overwhelming, review the 2022 Mentorship series (41 videos) to build foundational knowledge.
    *   The previous candles' high and the subsequent action are gone over, and the reason for market movement is explained.
    *   "Here's that old real liquidity void where the market leaves it comes back up hits it can't get back into it again why because now it's a balanced price range the market moves lower and then drift slower and then we have all of our imbalances now from the hourly chart which was this to this let me let me go back up one more time I'm sorry I didn't do a good job there this candle's"

I have retained all the details, context, and nuances, organized the information logically, and highlighted key elements. I have also maintained the original tone and narrative style while improving clarity and coherence.


Here is the reorganized and formatted text, focusing on improved clarity, grammar, and coherence while meticulously preserving all original details and nuances:

# Analysis of PM Session on ES (One-Minute Chart)

## Context: Nested PD Arrays and Fair Value Gaps

*   **Four-Hour Chart**: Larger Fair Value Gap.
*   **Hourly Chart**: Fair Value Gap defined by trend lines.
*   **15-Minute Chart**: Fair Value Gap.
*   **Five-Minute Chart**: Fair Value Gap (highlighted in yellow).

> We have nested PD arrays in the form of a fair value gap: the larger one here on the four hour, the hourly with the trend lines, the 15-minute chart, and then finally the five minute chart.

### Visual Representation on Charts

*   The analysis focuses on a range defined by a candle's high and low.

    *   "I'm highlighting the fact that we have this range between this candle's high and that candle's low."
*   On the five-minute chart, a yellow range highlights this area.

### Trading Style & Chart Setup

*   **Trading Preference**: Clean chart; levels are observed without indicators.
*   **Purpose of Chart Markings**: To draw attention to salient market deliveries.
*   **Recommendation for New Students**: Chart markings can aid in understanding algorithmic precision.
*   **Reasoning**: New traders benefit from visualizing key levels to understand algorithmic responses.

> I don't trade with anything on my chart. I see the levels and then I work with them on the chart naked. I don't have any of this stuff on it. This is only to draw your attention to what my mind is considering salient to the market's delivery at the time of real-time data.

## Examination of Market Behavior on One-Minute Chart

### Initial Observations

*   The market leaves a balanced price range with a liquidity void.
*   **Liquidity Void Behavior**: Market breaks a low, returns, but cannot re-enter the range.
*   **Imbalance**: Price moves lower into the hourly imbalance, then deeper into 15-minute and 5-minute imbalances.

> Here we have it leaving that balance price range earlier with that liquidity void, the real liquidity volume. It leaves it, breaks a low there and comes back up and just says, "I can't get back up in there," and even leaves what that little gap between that candle's low and that candle's high open right there.

### Reference to Prior Market Analysis

*   A five-handle move was recorded using volume and balance, as shared on Twitter Friday morning.
*   **Twitter Note**: Emphasis on note at 3864, with relative equal highs (mentioned in the morning chart).

### Market Reaction

*   Market trades down to the low end of the four-hour imbalance with precision.
*   **Subsequent Rally**: Price returns into the hourly, 15-minute, and five-minute ranges.

## Importance of Time Settings in TradingView

### Time Zone Alignment

*   **Crucial Setting**: TradingView time should always be set to New York time, regardless of your global location.
*   **Reasoning**:
    *   Alignment with the algorithm.
    *   Consistency with the provided analysis.
*   **Consequences of Incorrect Time**: Confusion and difficulty in identifying chart elements.

> You always, no matter where you are globally, you always have the time settings on TradingView set to New York. If you don't do that, number one, you will not be in alignment with the algorithm and you will not be in alignment with my analysis.

### Daylight Savings Time

*   **Index Futures**: Use New York local time (including daylight savings, if applicable).
*   **Forex**: Time settings are less critical.

## PM Session (3:00 PM - 4:00 PM New York Time)

### Identifying Trading Opportunities

*   **Window of Opportunity**: A small, accessible trading window.
*   **Target**: Aim for five handles or more.
*   **Prerequisites**: Requires understanding what to look for.

> If you are looking for just something that is going to be a real easy small window of trading, you don't have a whole lot of time, and you want to just really go in there and look for something that's going to offer five handles or more...

### Liquidity Pool and Market Narrative

*   **Buy-Side Liquidity Pool**: Located at 3864.
*   **Objective**: Identify reasons to trust a run towards the liquidity pool.
*   **Pre-existing Knowledge**: The focus on 3864 was publicly shared in the morning.

### Algorithm and Market Dynamics

*   The algorithm offers higher prices, attracting market participants.
*   **Short Covering Rallies**: Driven by the algorithm, not buying pressure.
*   **Trader Actions**: Short sellers are forced to cover as the algorithm moves higher.
*   **Last Trading Day of the Year**: Traders book profits, contributing to the rally.
*   **Key Factor**: Liquidity above 3864, triggering buy stops.

> The market will rally because the algorithm keeps offering a higher price... It forces, it twists the arm of traders, not because of their buying pressure.

### Analysis of Market Movements

*   Movement outside the four-hour imbalance before returning precisely to it.
*   **Ideal Setup**: Look for easy setups with perfect alignment.

### One-Minute Chart Analysis

*   **Focus**: Buy-side Imbalance Sell-side Inefficiency.
*   **Candle Highs and Lows**: Exact matches at 3839.25, demonstrating precision.
*   **Stop Loss Placement**: Just below the one-minute Fair Value Gap.
*   **Rationale**: Expectation that the 60-minute Fair Value Gap will provide support.

> I outlined it real time, it was recorded, it was executed on, and you seen the delivery. Okay, if there was not an algorithm, price wouldn't do that. My stop loss was placed just below here right at that candle's opening why? Because it's going to respect that one minute fair value Gap.


Here is the reorganized and formatted text, meticulously preserving all original details and nuances while enhancing clarity and structure:

# Algorithmic Market Analysis: Fair Value Gaps and Liquidity (One-Minute Chart)

## Initial Market Conditions: 60-Minute Fair Value Gap

*   **Key Observation**: Unwillingness of candle bodies to close at the low end of the 60-minute Fair Value Gap.
*   **Anticipation**: Waiting for the market to leave this area and initiate a move higher.
*   **Trigger**: Observing a candle indicating a market breakaway with significant acceleration.

> to kick off once this shows all the bodies being unwilling to close at the low end of that 60 Minute for Vega once I see this I'm waiting for the market to want to leave this area and starts to move here and then right there this candle that's exactly what I'm looking for the Market's starting to break away take off a lot of acceleration once it does this it creates another what this is here a fair value Gap...

## Fair Value Gap Dynamics: Breakaway Gaps and Market Structure

*   **Fair Value Gap Creation**: Acceleration creates a new Fair Value Gap.
*   **Characteristics**: This Fair Value Gap is likely to remain open.
*   **Comparison**: Similar to a previous gap, acting as a reference point.
*   **Visual Representation**: Shaded rectangle between a candle's high and low.
    *   "Between this candle is high and this candle's low right there, that's what I'm shading in as a rectangle."
*   **Market Behavior**: Price consistently fills in these gaps before continuing.
*   **Rejection of Conventional Concepts**: Differentiating algorithmic behavior from support/resistance, Wyckoff, or supply/demand theories.

> but this fair value Gap is likely to stay open what does that mean much like this Gap here...the market comes completely down and fills that in right there and it does it again here and it does it again right there perfectly perfectly that's not support resistance that's not like off that's not supply and demand it is absolutely the algorithm...

## Market Structure Analysis: Consolidation, Expansion, and Continuation

*   **Algorithmic Behavior**: Consolidation, expansion, and continuation patterns.
*   **Rejection of Retracement**: The algorithm will not likely consolidate, expand, and then immediately retrace.
*   **Gap Preservation**: The algorithm aims to keep a specific area open.
*   **Examples**: Two examples from the week illustrate this behavior.
*   **Anticipatory Identification**: Identifying the pattern before it becomes evident.
*   **Non-Overlapping Range**: Absence of overlap in a specific range defined by an up-candle.
*   **Rebalancing**: Upward movement necessitates a downward rebalancing.
*   **Delivery**: Offering both buy-side and sell-side liquidity.
*   **Balanced Price Range**: Above the low of the specified candle, indicating a balanced range unlikely to be revisited.
*   **Breakaway Candle**: A single candle passing through, confirming the gap's existence and its tendency to remain open.

> ...and once it does this it completely closes that in and then leaves it but it starts off another Vega right as it leaves this one so it's not going to do what it's not going to be consolidation expansion reversal it's going to be consolidation expansion and continue it can consolidate and then run higher but it's not going to consolidate expansion come right back in into a retracement that's not what it's going to do the algorithm is going to leave this little area open and you watch me do two examples of it this this week I identified it before it even proved to you as the viewer it wasn't going to go back in close this in this range in or overlap what you see here this up candle that range between this candles open here and this candle's low here that one single up candle that green one...

## Trading Strategy and Execution: Breakaway Gaps and Liquidity Pools

*   **Buying Strategy**: Initiating a buy if the price starts to move back down into the specified low area.
*   **Stop Loss Placement**: Positioning the stop loss just below the bodies of preceding candles.
*   **Liquidity Target**: Monitoring candle behavior as they gravitate towards the 3853.50 liquidity pool.
*   **Buy-Side Liquidity**: Targeting the short-term high located at 3853.50 for buy-side liquidity.
*   **Hourly Range Disregard**: Dismissing the hourly range due to its breach.
*   **Breakaway Gap Analysis**: Characterizing the Fair Value Gap as a breakaway gap.
    *   "Here's the five minute favorite Gap this Breakaway gap which is what this is it's a fair bag Gap but it's a breakaway Gap..."
*   **Breakaway Gap Tendency**: Low probability of the breakaway gap being traded back into.

> ...let me take this off for a second this one candle gets overlapped right there so it's going up it has to do what to rebalance it has to go down so now we've done what we've offered by side delivery sell side delivery and then when we leave that range here once we get back Above This candle's low this is a balanced price range it's not it's not going back down there especially if we have one single candle pass through again where it's taking off and then we have this candle since this candle closes and we start this candle right there then I know that that Gap is there and it's going to stay open but what happens if it starts to go back down into it into this low right in here I'm going to buy it and knowing it's not going to go down here in my stop would go just below the bodies of these candles here which is what it went to next Once I trailed it up and I'm going to watch these candles paint and watch and see how they gravitate towards this pool of liquidity which was 38.53 and a half once this was filled again it's all short-term High back here buy side right there it gravitates to that one so this one's no longer salient we don't need to worry about the hourly because we've already left that range it's gone and all of the the trades and the executions which I gotta add now that little rectangle back on here because otherwise it won't show as nicely as I want to and we'll just do it with uh that's good okay and here's the five minute favorite Gap this Breakaway gap which is what this is it's a fair bag Gap but it's a breakaway Gap...

## Advanced Entry Techniques: Breakers and Rebalancing

*   **Buying at the Fair Value Gap**: Purchasing at the top of the Fair Value Gap.
*   **One-Minute Candle Timing**: Using one-minute candles to time entries.
*   **Secondary Entry Explanation**: Buying inside an up candle due to a breaker pattern.
*   **Short-Term Low Target**: The algorithm targeting a short-term low for liquidity and rebalancing.
*   **Balanced Price Range Formation**: Formation of a balanced price range after liquidity sweep.
*   **Outside Candle Confirmation**: A single candle passing through on the outside confirms the breakaway.
*   **Novelty of Concept**: Emphasizing that the concept is unique and not found in retail trading books.

> ...a breakaway Gap in this is not likely to be traded back into you don't want to see it traded back into and if we take this five minute off because now we know that that's where it's likely to occur this suddenly takes on a whole new Dynamic when you see everything I'm doing I'm buying at the top of the fair value Gap right here as it goes into it here and then I'm buying it here and here as it's tagging on a one minute candle time to time it as it hits it boom boom and then right in here I'm adding one more because this is a breaker I'm surprised most of you didn't even ask why'd you do this secondary entry right there I'm going to show you we're going to take this rectangle and just add it to this here okay and what I'm doing is I'm buying inside this up candle because what it's doing is there's a short-term low here it's going after that liquidity and rebalancing here there and it runs up now it's a balanced price range it should not enter this area again and then we have one single candle passing through on the outside that's a break we got you don't find that in any of your retail books folks...

## Intellectual Property and Market Dynamics: Algorithmic Precision

*   **Omission for Protection**: Deliberate omission of certain details to protect intellectual property.
*   **Uncredited Imitation**: Addressing concerns about others attempting to publish content without proper credit.
*   **Buy-Side Liquidity Run**: Visualizing the run into buy-side liquidity.
*   **Precision Execution**: Entries executed within the final hour of trading.
*   **Slight Timing Inaccuracy**: Acknowledging a minor deviation (two minutes) from the precise target.
*   **Emphasis on Precision**: Striving for high levels of accuracy in trading.

> ...and I'm leaving other parts of it out because it's going to be in my books I know some of you who's already out there trying to write Amazon books and put my stuff out there and not even crediting me yeah I'm going to be in your reviews trust me so the running up into the buy sell liquidity here you can see as we hit it there you go so let's put the lipstick on as you would expect to see if it was a real execution it would look like that okay and all of the entries were done inside the final hour of trading and the liquidity was filled almost two minutes late technically I was expecting these candles to reach up in there as we were getting to the four o'clock hour but Humanity in me it caused me to be about two minutes or so off but that's okay I guess so I mean it's it's good to me I call it a Miss but you know that's what I strive for for levels of precision...

## Algorithmic Market Structure and Trading Psychology

*   **Algorithmic Liquidity Seeking**: Identifying opportunities where the algorithm seeks liquidity.
*   **Rejection of Pattern-Based Trading**: Avoiding reliance on patterns, harmonic formations, or trendline analysis.
*   **Raw Algorithmic Market**: Emphasizing the importance of understanding the raw market algorithmically.
*   **Repetitive Nature**: Highlighting the repetitive nature of algorithmic patterns.
*   **Time-Based Repetition**: Certain times of the day when patterns repeat.
*   **Decision Making**: Determining whether to reverse or stay out based on market conditions.
*   **Beginner Advice**: Suggesting new traders should err on the side of caution and observe rather than reverse.
*   **Experienced Trader Flexibility**: Experienced traders may reverse based on analysis.
*   **Funded Trader Caution**: Strongly advising funded traders against reversing.
*   **Session-Based Trading**: Focusing on making trades within specific sessions (e.g., morning session).

> ...don't you try to do those types of things because it's going to take you decades to get to this level but this is what we do we look for opportunities where the algorithm is going to seek liquidity we're not looking for patterns we're not looking for harmonic things we're not looking for you know any kind of trend line analysis you know none of that stuff it's the raw market algorithmically and it repeats over and over and over again there's certain times of the day it will repeat and then there's certain times the market will be expected to do something and then we have to decide whether or not we're going to reverse or stay out in the beginning if you're new it's better for you to err on the side of well I'm going to go with staying out and just observe don't reverse but with experience sometimes not all the time sometimes you'll find it's a good opportunity to reverse if your analysis doesn't pan out or it doesn't come to fruition aversed Trader in price action and understanding what they're doing they may go in and fade their initial analysis and reverse and do something entirely different I've done that I've executed that I've done it in front of other people but generally as a rule of thumb if you're new you don't want to go when you're thinking okay I was wrong let me go the other direction and that's how you blow your account and if you are a funded Trader you've accumulated a funded account through all these funded prop firms you certainly don't want to be doing that if you're a funded Trader never ever ever ever ever reverse just stay out and wait for the next session what does that mean if you're trading the morning session between 8 30 and 11 you want to be looking to make your money or your trade there if you lose there okay be done and wait for the afternoon session...

## Market Manipulation and Trading Opportunities

*   **Broken Wing Trick**: Analogy to a robin feigning injury to distract predators.
*   **Avoiding the Trap**: Warning new traders against falling for manipulative market tactics.
*   **Patience and Observation**: Emphasizing the importance of waiting for the next trading session.
*   **PM Session Focus**: Concentrating on the PM session (2:00 PM - 4:00 PM), especially the final hour.
*   **High-Probability Moves**: Expecting moves towards old highs, lows, or imbalances.
*   **Simplicity of Analysis**: Stressing the lack of complexity in identifying these moves.

> ...but what happens if your analysis in the morning you're expecting it to go up and it starts to go down don't don't reverse wait because if it's going to be a reversal of your analysis and if you're using what I'm teaching chances are you're probably gonna have something really nice in the PM session it's going to be cleaner than the morning let everybody else get chopped up and banged around if if everybody's thinking it's going to go One Direction many times the market will create these opportunities where you'll get like a broken wing trick like a robin you ever see a robin when they're out there on the ground and they're trying to teach their babies how to fly if they see you and they're always going to see you before you see them they'll start tweeting and put their wing out like it's broken and that's going to draw the attention of you the predator in their eyes to them and it they'll move real slow away from their baby and you'll chase after that because you see it and hear it oh it's an easy prey let me go get that and as you get closer to it right before you get close enough to it it flies away there's nothing wrong with it the market does those types of Tricks so as a neophyte as a new Trader you don't want to be in there falling victim to the robin okay you're getting out there chasing something you think is easy and then oh let me go back to hunting the baby okay let me reverse and do something else you shouldn't do that at all just just wait wait to the next trading session and if you try to have a expectation in the PM session PM session is two o'clock to four o'clock you can reduce that down into the last hour trading every single trading day that's worth its weight in trading this type of move is going to be there there's going to be a run to an old high or an old low or an imbalance okay it's going to be something to that effect there's no other complication to this...

## Expertise and Market Understanding

*   **Addressing Criticism**: Acknowledging and dismissing criticism from those with limited understanding.
*   **Extensive Experience**: Justifying the long-winded explanations with extensive experience.
*   **Beyond Buying and Selling**: Emphasizing that trading involves more than just knowing when to buy or sell.
*   **Candle Behavior**: New Focus on understanding why certain candles do not fill in as expected (addressing the liquidity void misconception).
*   **Layered Experience**: The ability to determine candle behavior comes from layered experience and circumstances.

# Market Analysis and Trading Strategy: January [Date]

## Introduction

This video outlines the presenter's market analysis and trading strategy for the morning session of the first trading day of the year. The presenter focuses on specific price levels, chart patterns, and market structures to identify potential trading opportunities.

**Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHaD0mebgMU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHaD0mebgMU)

## Pre-Market Expectations and Strategy

*   **PMI Number:** The presenter was awaiting the release of the PMI number at 9:45 AM.
*   **Anticipated Scenario:** The expectation was for a price whip upwards, followed by a sell-off. This potential scenario was mentioned on Twitter.
*   **Focus on News:** The focus was specifically on the 9:45 AM news release, not just the 9:30 AM opening.

### Key Price Levels and Range

*   **Identifying Highs:** The presenter pointed out a specific high, identifying it as the highest within the day's opening range.
*   **Range Bound:** The market was considered to be "stuck" within this range, awaiting a breakout.
*   **Trading Inside the Range:** While trading within the range is possible, it requires more patience.

## Multi-Timeframe Analysis

### 60-Minute Chart

*   **Missed Imbalance:** The price failed to reach the employment imbalance on the daily chart.
*   **Liquidity Swaps:** The market experienced two buy/sell liquidity swaps.
*   **Sell-Side Liquidity:** Sell-side liquidity was taken out on the 30-minute chart.

### 30-Minute Chart

*   **Imbalance Visibility:** The 30-minute chart was used because it clearly showed an imbalance.
*   **Failed Run:** The market failed to run above a specific high.
*   **Confirmation:** Waiting for confirmation of a run in either direction was crucial.

### 15-Minute Chart

*   **Fair Value Gap:** A clear fair value gap was identified on the 15-minute chart.
*   **Repricing and Lower Movement:** The price returned to the fair value gap, repriced, and moved lower.
*   **Target Level:** A target of 3814.5 was identified.

### 5-Minute Chart

*   **Buy-Side Liquidity:** The market traded above, indicating buy-side liquidity.
*   **Round Number:** The price point of 3900 was identified as a significant round number.
*   **Break Lower:** The market broke lower after reaching this level.

### 1-Minute Chart

*   **Swing Low:** A swing low was identified as important.
*   **Institutional Overflow Entry Drill:** An institutional overflow entry drill was observed after trading up into an imbalance.
*   **Market Structure Change:** This breakdown significantly altered the market structure.

### Key Concepts and Definitions

*   **Bearish ICT Breaker:** The presenter identifies a bearish ICT breaker pattern.
*   **Mean Threshold:** Defined as half of an order block. Candle bodies respect half the range from the candles high and low.
*   **Bearish Order Block:** Up-close candles are identified as a bearish order block after a breakthrough.
*   **Institutional Order Entry Drill:** This pattern was present, providing confirmation for a short position.
*   **Breakaway Gap:** The range left open was identified as a breakaway gap.
*   **Consequent Encroachment:** Defined as the middle of a gap or inefficiency, such as a fair value gap. Halfway point of imbalance.
*   **Buy Side Imbalance Sell Side Inefficiency (BISI) / Sell Side Imbalance Buy Side Inefficiency (SIBI):** Both scenarios are equally valid.

## Trade Execution and Rationale

### Initial Short Trade

*   **Fair Value Gap Entry:** A short position was initiated at the top of the "orange" fair value gap at 3886.
*   **Continuation Expectation:** The expectation was for a continuation down to levels shared on Twitter.
*   **Judas Swing Expectation:** There was an initial expectation of an aggressive run-up to 3920 as a "Judas swing" (fake rally) during the PMI numbers.
*   **Market Condition Adjustment:** Because the market did not reach 3905, the presenter waited for a shift in market structure just below 3872-73 and a return to a fair value gap before acting.

### Additional Short Entries

*   **Shift in Market Structure:** A shift in market structure was observed below 3872-73.
*   **Fair Value Gap Retest:** Additional short entry on a retest of the fair value gap.
*   **Bearish Order Block:** Another short entry was based on the bearish order block.

### Target Levels and Partial Take Profits

*   **Initial Target:** The initial target was the 3839.25 level.
*   **Partial Profit:** One partial take profit was executed, leaving two contracts open.
*   **Next Target:** The next target was below 3842.50, where sell-side liquidity was present.

### Risk Management

*   **30-Minute Fair Value Gap:** The presenter monitored the 30-minute fair value gap, planning to close trades if the price moved above it.
*   **Maintaining Heaviness:** The goal was to see the price remain "heavy," indicating a tendency to move lower with difficulty rallying higher.

### Post-Trade Analysis

*   **Beautiful Delivery:** Observed price delivery into the 30-minute fair value gap.
*   **Screenshot Recommendation:** The presenter encouraged viewers to mark up their own charts to develop understanding and skill, not to lazily copy.
*   **Involvement is Key:** Trading requires involvement and effort; otherwise, success is unlikely.

## Current Market State and Future Outlook

### Consolidation

*   The market is currently consolidating around the top end of the 30-minute fair value gap.

### Potential Breakout

*   The presenter anticipates an eventual breakout of the daily range.
*   **Intraday Scalping:** Until a higher timeframe daily narrative emerges, focus remains on intraday scalping.

### Conclusion

This analysis provides a detailed look into the presenter's trading strategy, highlighting the importance of multi-timeframe analysis, pattern recognition, and risk management.

# NASDAQ 100 Futures Analysis: March 2023 Contract

## Introduction

This analysis focuses on the **NASDAQ 100 Futures March delivery contract for 2023**. The analysis will cover volume, balance, and key price levels, while also addressing considerations for Forex traders and the impact of Non-Farm Payroll week. The video URL for the visual component of this analysis is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojy5ApHhEu4.

## Daily Chart Analysis: Volume and Balance

*   The analyst identified a specific level for Wednesday's trading, anticipating a move up to that point.
*   The identified area is characterized by an alignment of bodies (close to body opening) with a single pass-through.
*   **Volume Imbalance**: Defined by the relationship between candle wicks:
    *   The low of one candle's wick
    *   The high of another candle's wick
    *   Price action closed solely with wicks, with no bodies.

## Forex Commentary and Market Scope

*   **Focus Shift**: The analyst will begin daily analysis on **Euro Dollar, Pound Dollar, and Dollar Index** starting February 7th, in addition to **NASDAQ Futures and E-mini S&P Futures**.
*   **Crypto Exclusion**: The analyst explicitly stated they will not be covering cryptocurrency due to a lack of personal interest and trading experience in that asset class.

## Anticipated Market Movement and Lower Timeframe Analysis

*   The analyst anticipated a run-up into the **alignment balance** (shaded area).
*   Further analysis will involve dropping down to the **60-minute** and **5-minute** timeframes to refine the analysis.

## Trading Strategy and Non-Farm Payroll Considerations

*   The analyst emphasizes the importance of focusing on **Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday up to the New York session** for trading during Non-Farm Payroll weeks.
*   **Non-Farm Payroll Week**: Typically the first week of every month, with employment numbers released on Friday. Thursday and Friday tend to be choppy and less predictable.
*   The same unpredictable behavior is often observed after the New York session on Wednesday.
*   Positions held overnight from Tuesday into Wednesday (long and open) are generally considered favorable, but the strategy is to square positions.
*   The analyst intentionally traded during these conditions to illustrate the reduced precision and accuracy of typical trading elements.

## Trade Review and Market Observations

*   The analyst has shared a quick trade review vignette (posted prior to this video and on Twitter).
*   The detailed breakdown will show how to approach trading during these volatile periods.
*   **Disclaimer**: This is not an encouragement to trade during Non-Farm Payroll weeks, but rather a demonstration of the challenges involved.

## Impact of FOMC

*   **FOMC Announcement**: The day's analysis was impacted by the FOMC announcement at 2:00 PM.
*   The back-and-forth movement did not reach the initial alignment balance target.
*   The analyst acknowledges a potential argument for taking a trade at a lower level where price traded up, but emphasizes a preference for higher timeframe PD arrays.

## Pursuit of Precision and Algorithmic Price Delivery

*   While relative equal highs were taken out (as shown in the short video), the analyst seeks a higher level of precision and a deeper understanding of algorithmic price delivery.
*   The analyst is focused on surpassing average retail analysis concepts.

## Key Low and Fractal Analysis

*   The analysis will delve into the low on the 3rd of the month, using that fractal to gain insights into the subsequent low and inform long positions targeting relative equal highs and the higher area of interest.

## Forex Trader Considerations and US 100

*   **Accessibility for Non-US Traders**: Forex traders (especially those using MT4 outside the US) can trade the **US 100**, which is equivalent to the NASDAQ 100 futures contract.
*   While not perfectly matching the futures market, the US 100 offers a close approximation for applying the same concepts.

## ES and US 500 Equivalents

*   **US Traders (ES)**: Use the **ESH2023** symbol on TradingView (March delivery contract). H in the symbol name indicates the month of March. After expiration, it will switch to June (symbol M).
*   **Non-US/MT4 Traders (ES Equivalent)**: Use the **US 500**, which is the equivalent of the E-mini S&P 500 futures contract.

## TradingView Platform and Real-Time Data

*   TradingView is recommended for its user-friendliness.
*   Real-time data is required and incurs a small monthly fee.
*   **Disclaimer**: The analyst has no affiliation with TradingView.

## CFD vs. Futures

*   US traders are generally restricted from trading US 100 and US 500 CFDs (Contracts for Difference), and should focus on the futures contracts.
*   Real-time data is essential for accurate futures market pricing (ES and NQ).

## Lower Timeframe Analysis (Hourly, 15-Minute, 5-Minute)

*   The analysis will delve into the hourly chart, focusing on relative equal highs and net volume.
*   The timeframe will be further refined to the 15-minute chart, and then the 5-minute chart to identify imbalances.
*   **Emphasis**: Users should analyze their own charts to reinforce the lessons from the video.

## 5-Minute Chart and New York Time

*   **Time Zone**: TradingView charts should be set to New York time for consistency with the analysis.
*   The low on January 4th, 2023, is a key reference point.
*   Scrubbing back to January 3rd reveals a down-closed candle and price movement.
*   **Buy-Side Imbalance, Sell-Side Inefficiency**: The high of the identified down-closed candle is anchored at the price level of 10864.75.

## 1-Minute Chart Analysis

*   The analyst emphasizes that their trading approach is not limited to the 2022 mentorship model; it encompasses various self-authored models and concepts.
*   Students should focus on the concepts that resonate most with them.
*   The upcoming live sessions will require real-time analysis, so it will be different than pre-recorded analysis.

## Replay Commentary and Live Session Expectations

*   The analyst will provide commentary similar to what will be present in live sessions.
*   During live sessions, the analyst will indicate probable market movements but will not be pushing buttons or executing trades live for the audience.
*   The compressed replay highlights actual trade executions and annotations.

## The Reason Behind Adding Watermarks

*   The watermarks are added to the video to prevent others from impersonating the Analyst and re-uploading their contents without permission.

## Buy-Side Imbalance (Continued)

*   Revisiting the low on January 3rd, the analyst identifies a buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency represented by a single candle.
*   While the market moved lower, a portion of the imbalance remained open, indicating a potential revisit in the future.
*   Overshoots are acceptable, and the order block on the 5-minute chart remains a possibility.

## Trade Execution and Time Windows

*   The market traded down, closed completely, hit the order block, and consolidated.
*   The 10:30 to 11:00 AM time window is highlighted.
*   Initial movement at 9:30 AM was to the downside, tagging the lows and then moving up for buy-side liquidity/buy stops.
*   **Note**: These notes are from the actual chart used in real-time during execution.

## Market Sentiment and Expectations

*   Buy-side liquidity (buy stops) rests above relative equal highs.
*   Traders are often taught that these highs represent resistance, leading to expectations of lower prices.
*   The market did move lower, but to a discount level.
*   The analyst expected a movement lower at 9:30 going into 10:00, and then move up.
*   The analyst's expectation was for the market to go down to go up, driven by the daily volume imbalance and the expectation of this imbalance to be a draw on liquidity.
*   The **FOMC announcement and the Non-Farm Payroll week conditions** contribute to this volatile behavior. The analyst clarifies that this is the actual week, not a description of the conditions.


Here is the reorganized and refined text, aiming for clarity, coherence, and retention of all original details:

# NASDAQ 100 Futures Analysis: Continued

## Sloppy Price Delivery and US 100 Demonstration

*   The analyst notes that during certain market conditions, price delivery can be **"sloppy."**
*   Targets might not be perfectly filled or even touched at all.
*   To illustrate, the analyst will demonstrate how the **US 100** (for non-US traders) reached its **daily volume imbalance.**
*   This demonstration aims to encourage real-time study using the **US 100**.
*   Real-time data is not strictly necessary for this approach.

## US 100, US 500, and US 30 Usage

*   The analyst uses **US 100, US 500, and US 30** for analysis, even though they don't trade down futures.
*   This practice will be demonstrated in future examples and live streams.
*   The analyst will show real-time **SMT (Smart Money Technique) diversions** and **relative strength analysis**.
    *   This analysis does **not** use the **RSI indicator**.

## Anticipating Market Movement

*   The analyst believed the market was likely to rise into the **volume imbalance** area, acting as a potential draw.
*   If the market drops into a **deep discount**, it's likely to rise, targeting buy-side liquidity.
    *   First, it will target the buy side (buy stops) above a specified high.
    *   Then, it might move up into the **daily volume imbalance** (shaded area).

## One-Minute Fair Value Gap Analysis

*   The analysis will focus on how the market moved into a **one-minute fair value gap**.
    *   This fair value gap takes the form of a **buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency (BISI)**.
*   The analyst acknowledges that these terms might be confusing initially.
*   However, repeated exposure and practical application will make them more familiar.
*   The analyst urges viewers to persist and not give up, promising that the effort is worthwhile.

## Trade Execution and Market Structure Shift

*   The market trades down into the **order block**.
*   It then trades down into the **buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency (BISI)**, a form of fair value gap.
*   After this, it rallies and consolidates.
*   Finally, it dives below a **short-term low** and then runs above a **short-term high**.
*   This sequence represents a **shift in market structure** while in the discount.
*   This action leaves behind a **fair value gap**.
*   The analyst clicks on the fair value gap, highlights it, and hits the delete key to remove it to improve visibility.
*   The analyst presses "Control+Z" to bring the fair value gap back for further discussion.
*   The market then rallies away from this **fair value gap**.
*   The analyst wanted price to remain above this gap, indicating that it would not trade back below it.

## Comparing NASDAQ (NQ) and E-mini S&P (ES)

*   The analyst addresses why they chose to analyze NASDAQ (NQ) instead of E-mini S&P (ES).
*   The Analyst jokes by mentioning a fake secret indicator used by best hedge fund traders to determine Market movement.
*   The actual comparison involves adding the E-mini S&P (ES) chart to the TradingView layout.
*   **TradingView Instructions:**
    *   Click the "+" symbol in the upper left corner.
    *   Select "New Pane".
    *   Type in **ESH2023** to plot the E-mini S&P (ES) chart below the NASDAQ (NQ) chart.
*   **For Non-US Traders:**
    *   Use the **US 100** and the **US 500** (CFD for non-US markets) for comparison.
*   To overlay the charts:
    *   Click the "+" symbol.
    *   Choose the instrument (e.g., US 500).
    *   A line chart will appear.
    *   Click the gear icon.
    *   Go to "Style" and select "Candlesticks."
*   This setup allows for comparing and contrasting **SMT diversions**.
*   Using a vertical line as a reference point, the analyst compares the highs and lows of both charts.
*   The NASDAQ chart showed a higher high, while the E-mini S&P chart did not.
*   Later, the E-mini S&P chart showed a higher high, while the NASDAQ chart did not.

## Relative Strength Analysis and Breakaway Gaps

*   A **short-term high** was taken out on both charts.
*   However, NASDAQ showed a stronger "punch through."
*   This indicates that NASDAQ had **relative strength**.
*   After digging into the **one-minute buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency (BISI)**, the analyst expected the market to turn.
*   **Key Observation**: The analyst emphasizes that the sharper technical picture was observed on the NASDAQ chart.
*   There was a small gap on the E-mini S&P chart, but it was "sloppy" and traded down below it.
*   The NASDAQ chart did not exhibit this behavior, indicating greater strength.
*   The analyst wanted to buy the fair value gap on NASDAQ, trusting that it would not completely close.
*   The goal was for it to act as a **breakaway gap**.
*   The market had already traded down into the one-minute buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency (BISI).

## Buy-Side Imbalance, Sell-Side Inefficiency (BISI) and Sell-Side Imbalance, Buy-Side Inefficiency (SIBI) Definitions

*   The analyst provides definitions for **buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency (BISI)** and **sell-side imbalance, buy-side inefficiency (SIBI)**

    *   If a candle moves aggressively upwards in a single pass, creating a fair value gap, that fair value gap is labeled as **buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency (BISI)**.

    *   If a candle opens and trades downwards, creating a fair value gap, that fair value gap is labeled as **sell-side imbalance, buy-side inefficiency (SIBI)**.

    *   **BISIs** are bought for longs or traded to as targets when short.

    *   **SIBIs** are sold short or targeted from longs.
*   The analyst states that there will be further discussion of these concepts throughout the year.

## Trade Management and Measuring Gaps

*   The analyst removes the ES chart from TradingView to focus on NASDAQ.
*   The market trades down into the fair value gap.
*   The analyst mentioned it would not go back below that level.
*   This area becomes a **balanced price range**, accumulating new long positions.
*   The analyst also stated that a specific fair value gap would form support.
*   The analyst was slightly incorrect about the precise low, which is typical during **FOMC and Non-Farm Payroll weeks**.
*   The analyst looked at this low as potential to create an institutional order flow entry drill (IOFED).
*   An **institutional order flow entry drill (IOFED)** is a small movement into a fair value gap that doesn't completely close it.
*   High-frequency trading algorithms use this as an entry model.
*   It involves a partial entry into a fair value gap (not even halfway).
*   The market does create support and rallies.
*   The analyst anchors to the down-closed candle's open price.
*   A small gap forms, which the analyst identifies as a **measuring gap**.
*   This relates to the concept of a **breakaway gap**.
*   From the long entry to this point, it represents half of the move.
*   Buy-side liquidity is targeted above a high.
*   The analyst is drawing on previous experience to determine when they are going to stay open.
*   **Traditional Technical Analysis:** Classic technical analysis describes gaps, but doesn't show how to utilize them in real-time, especially in electronic (24-hour) markets.
*   **Liquidity Void**: Gaps or inefficiencies in price are sometimes called a liquidity void.
*   The analyst says that that is an unfortunate name for it, since a liquidity void is when there isn't actually any trading at all.
*   Liquidity voids are areas where there is no trading; therefore, is an inefficiency in price.
*   These areas are actually imbalances (buy-side or sell-side).
*   **Buy-Side Imbalance, Sell-Side Inefficiency (BISI)**: The algorithm creates these areas.
*   Other educators, such as Chris Lori, have talked about these areas as liquidity voids, which tend to fill in sometimes.
*   The Analyst logic indicates when they don't get filled, and what to do with that information.
*   The analyst's logic tells you when they don't, and what you do with that information.
*   The analyst acknowledges that they learned the term liquidity void from Chris Lori.
*   The analyst is now operating at a "PhD level" of technical analysis.
*   Viewers are seeing more precision and understanding.
*   The goal is to identify opportunities that the algorithm presents to "smart money."
*   "Smart money" refers to people who understand these concepts.

## Repetitive Setups and Trading Strategy

*   Once viewers understand these concepts, they will be able to identify setups independently.
*   They will anticipate market movements and know what the market is likely to do.
*   This provides an "edge."
*   Viewers wait for specific times of day and for signatures that justify a trade.
*   Watching real-time data will reveal repetitive setups.
*   The live sessions will showcase setups that form repetitively.
*   The recordings will be long (up to two hours).
*   The analyst aims to provide one good setup per week.
*   Many setups exist; viewers have already seen the equivalent of $40,000 in value in the last five trading days.
*   The analyst is teaching viewers to strive for a base target, which is equivalent to twenty ticks.
*   Viewers need to find a place where everything nests together, which is a market maker buy model in this example.

## Trade Execution Example

*   The market continues upwards.
*   The analyst mentioned that a rejection block would be the next draw.
*   The analyst took profits above a specific high.
*   They then took three more positions.
*   They left one position open, wanting to see it trade up into the daily volume imbalance (shaded area).
*   The market almost stopped the analyst out.
*   The analyst viewed a specific level as the "last line in the sand."
*   The market stopped the analyst out and has not moved higher since.
*   Then, there was **FOMC noise.**

# NASDAQ 100 Futures Analysis: Continued (Trade Management and Mindset)

## Responsible Mentorship and Trading Expectations

*   The analyst emphasizes the importance of responsible mentorship.
    *   Trading **FOMC** (Federal Open Market Committee) events is discouraged, comparing it to a "carnival ride" or **Non-Farm Payroll** event.
    *   Just because it's *possible* to trade during these events doesn't mean it *should* be done.
*   The goal is to teach viewers how to find **one good setup per week** with high probability and a statistical edge.
*   The analyst anticipates criticism from detractors and competitors who may accuse them of "cherry-picking."
*   Viewers are not obligated to subscribe to the analyst's teachings and can view them as contrived if they choose.
*   However, the analyst believes that the logic will become evident in the charts.
*   The analyst expresses excitement about "converting" viewers to understanding how markets are absolutely controlled.
*   Consistent observation over months will lead to conviction.

## Trade Replay and Management

*   The analyst will now go into the actual replay and management of the trade.
*   This includes explaining *how* and *why* decisions were made at specific moments.

### Initial Long Position

*   Based on the outlined analysis, the analyst is initiating a long position.
*   The order details are visible.
*   A risk of **2.1%** is used, based on a **$100,000** paper trading account.
*   The analyst addresses potential criticism of paper trading, emphasizing the importance of the precision elements when using real-time data.
*   Real-time data is essential for Market Replay on TradingView, preventing the "faking" or "gaming" possible with platforms like MT4.
*   The initial draw on the market is **buy-side liquidity**.
*   This is a **market maker buy model**.
    *   Viewers can learn more in the free "Scout Sniper Series" on the YouTube channel.

### Monitoring Price Action

*   The analyst is waiting for the price to move away from the **order block**.
*   The focus is on the expansion beyond relative equal highs, representing **buy-side liquidity**.
*   The analyst's "eye" should be trained over time.
*   The stop is moved to break even.
*   If the price goes back below after running those relative equal highs, it would be a negative sign.
*   The goal is to control risk.
*   The analyst wants the fair value gap (pink area) to act as support.
*   Specifically, the high of the fair value gap should act as support.
*   As the price rises, the analyst is watching its gravitation towards the **rejection block**.
*   The analyst favors the expansion and does not anticipate a collapse based on the earlier analysis.
*   A daily volume imbalance is already shaded on the chart (though not initially visible in the video).
*   The stop is moved up.
*   The analyst will look to buy/pyramid more of the position as it drops back down into that fair value gap.
*   Anticipating a fair value gap to form as the candle closes.

### Algorithmic Price Action

*   A fair value gap forms.
*   The analyst likes that the gap is above the shaded (pink) area.
*   The analyst doesn't expect the price to trade back down through the pink area.
*   The pink area becomes a **balanced price range**.
    *   This is *not* classic support/resistance, supply/demand, Elliott Wave, or harmonics.
    *   It's algorithmic.
*   The analyst acknowledges that the concepts might seem complicated, and addresses comments from viewers who find it too difficult.
*   The analyst's focus is on those who genuinely want to understand how markets "book" price.
*   The analyst states that the algorithm will not reprice below that level.
*   The algorithm will aggressively attack the buy stops above the equal highs at **11,048**, targeting **11,050**.
*   The analyst is moving the stop up.
*   They trust the stop won't be hit because the pink area is protected.
*   The algorithm doesn't need to go back down there because it has already repriced.

### Anticipating Draw on Liquidity

*   **11,050** is anticipated as the next draw on liquidity.
*   There are two targets before that level, which will be mentioned as they approach.
*   A classic bull flag is forming.
*   The analyst doesn't want to get caught up thinking it will break down.
*   The price comes back down into the fair value gap.

### Adding to Long Position

*   The analyst likes that gap (not yet shaded).
*   The annotation indicates watching the support form at the top of the fair value gap.
*   The analyst wants to pyramid more of the position.
*   The sixth contract is added to the long position.
*   The fair value gap is drawn out.
*   The analyst likes that the price has dipped into the blue shade twice.
*   Two contracts are added here, whereas normally three might be added.
*   The analyst is building more position.

### Time-Based Charts

*   Naked charts are superior to indicator dribble, *unless* you have a time-based chart.
*   Without a time-based chart, you cannot see the key elements.
    *   Fair value gaps
    *   Imbalances
    *   Volume imbalances
    *   BISIs (Buy-Side Imbalance, Sell-Side Inefficiency)
    *   SIBIs (Sell-Side Imbalance, Buy-Side Inefficiency)
*   Range bars, Heikin Ashi, and Renko charts are dismissed as "nonsense" because the algorithms don't respect them.
*   The algorithm actually refers to these elements (Fair value gaps, imbalances, volume imbalances, BISIs, SIBIs).
*   When coding these things in price action, the analyst looks for the price to return to them, expecting them to perform as coded.
*   If the repeating phenomenon is identified, certain setups will become very easy to trust.
*   Not all setups will be tradable.

### Anticipating Market Movements

*   Large price ranges are expected to start coming in.
*   Price is expected to move higher as long as it doesn't dig into the pink shaded area (though a slight dip is acceptable).
*   The beginning of green candles moving up is desired.
*   There's a transition from large green candles to small range candles.
*   The next expectation is big candles.
*   If bullish, and the pink area is not expected to break, then the next series of big candles should be *up*.
*   The annotations (e.g., "large range candles are coming") are done in real-time.
*   The analyst wants to add more to their position.
*   Ten contracts is about as much as is wanted in this position, since a significant run in price is anticipated (around 600 ticks).
*   The next buy-side (buy stop) liquidity is highlighted right above **11,018.25**.

### Rejection Block

*   The rejection block is again highlighted.
*   The analyst anticipates the price reaching up into that area.
*   The framework is built as it would be in personal analysis or backtesting.
*   Charts should be annotated like this, looking at the logical levels.
*   PD arrays (Premium/Discount arrays) were taught in the core content lessons.
*   That's a classic bull flag.
*   Retail traders might try to go long there, as it's a breakout.
*   They would put their stop loss right below the swing low to the left of the analyst's partial entry long.
*   Watch what the algorithm does; it is designed to do this very thing.
*   When bull flags are correct and a higher run in price is anticipated, the algorithm will likely do this (engage stops).
*   Retail traders don't trust that bull flag because they got stopped out.
*   They will be too fearful to re-enter.
*   That's why it's coded that way.

### Institutional Order Flow Entry Drill (IOFED)

*   While the pink range isn't currently on the chart, it can dip slightly below the bottom of the highest blue rectangle.
*   Higher prices would then be delivered.
*   It might offer an Institutional Order Flow Entry Drill (IOFED).
*   It may need to go a couple of ticks lower.
*   The annotations are all done live through TradingView.
*   One of the reasons why trading post-New York session on Wednesday is disliked is because it's like this (not as precise).
*   The analyst is used to getting in on the low candles and out on the high candles, but it's "real muddy" during this particular time of the month.
*   An IOFED is likely.
*   If it trades down and touches just below that line, another partial position will be added, trusting that it will not collapse.
*   If it drops below that little trend line and the big up-close candle is highlighted, it's likely one last attempt to trick traders into going short before it "rips higher".
*   The analyst is ready to add one more contract long if offered.
*   The level just outside the view on the video (possibly yellow) is focused on.

### Order Block and Complaining Viewers

*   The down-closed candle to the left of the current price is seen as an order block.
*   The limit order is placed at the bottom of the daily volume imbalance.
*   The analyst was trying to anchor to the high of that candle but, being on a one-minute chart, knows the likelihood of it touching the open is there.
*   It would have been anchored to the high if more care had been taken.
*   The level is hit perfectly.
*   This is beautiful delivery.
*   The order block can always be reclaimed.
*   A reclaimed order block is where it acts as support, runs away, and comes back down and trades into it again.
*   This is completely normal and not something to be afraid of.
*   The logic is that it will not go below the original shaded area (though it's no longer shaded in the video).
*   The number one complaint will be that there aren't enough annotations on the chart during live sessions.
*   When annotating, the focus is taken off of watching the price because the analyst is trying to spell correctly and articulate the information properly on a one and five minute chart.
*   If that's the issue, then why not trade with a higher time frame chart?
*   Because viewers are already complaining that the videos are too long.
*   So, the question becomes: who *really* wants to learn here?
*   People who complain about the videos being long-winded or that the analyst doesn't get to the point are missing the key objective: learning how to make money.
*   Whether learning from the analyst or someone else, the goal is to make money, not pursue a hobby or play a video game.
*   The aim is to generate a secondary income or even replace a primary income.

### Targeting the Rejection Block

*   Price is expected to reach up into that rejection block.
*   Two contracts will come off above the rejection block.
*   The analyst anticipates a spike up into that area.
*   The idea that it will drive above all is reinforced.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, ensuring all details, context, and nuances are retained:

# NASDAQ 100 Futures Analysis: Continued (Trade Management and Mindset) - Part 2

## Addressing Viewer Feedback and Trade Execution Transparency

*   The analyst responds to viewer feedback regarding video editing and transparency.
    *   A viewer suggested that elements are added *after* the fact and that the video speed is manipulated.
    *   To counter this, the analyst provides real-time demonstrations.
    *   Typing actions are shown, like when toggling to "two contracts" and when the arrow appears after hitting the cell button.
    *   This illustrates that actions aren't added post-recording.
*   The analyst types "sold two contracts" to show the intended action.
    *   There's an internal monologue about how typing the action might delay the actual price movement.
    *   Typing it out may have "jinxed it," causing a slight delay before selling two of the ten contracts.
*   All this is described as "preamble" leading to a run-up into two more liquidity pools.
    *   Specifically targeting the spike wick high at **11,018.25**.
*   The analyst notes the sped-up nature of the video and the "sloppy" market conditions.
    *   Trading sloppy market days is generally avoided.
    *   Future videos will include these scenarios to illustrate the experience.
    *   Viewers are encouraged *not* to "turn them off".
*   The analyst cautions against overconfidence based on watching videos.
    *   Simply watching videos (like "ICT Netflix") isn't enough.
    *   Real-world experience ("in the trenches") is essential.
*   The video is sped up, roughly at 50% above normal speed (verified by the second count in the lower right corner).
    *   While recorded in real-time, the sped-up nature still makes it drawn out.
    *   This simulates the need for patience, which is crucial for profitable trading.
*   The analyst stresses the importance of watching price action.
    *   Reiterating that it's not going to reverse, it will pop higher, allowing them to take off two contracts.
    *   Removing the "sold two contracts" annotation because it's becoming visually cluttered.
    *   The analyst states they typically don't trade with so much visual clutter but it's for the viewer's edification.
*   The analyst acknowledges the drawn-out nature of the process.
    *   A significant amount of time is spent for a relatively small range.
    *   Still, there is enough movement to be delivered.
*   Apology for audio quality issues due to new trading office acoustics.
    *   The new home and room are causing voice reflections.
    *   The audio is expected to improve with further content production.
    *   Dismisses suggestions of using a cheap microphone, stating that a "dollar menu microphone" isn't being used.
    *   Acknowledges challenges with acoustics in various recording locations, including an RV.

## Measuring Gaps and Institutional Order Flow

*   A thin blue shaded area is identified as a "measuring gap."
    *   The analyst is looking for a potential Institutional Order Flow Entry Drill (IOFED) that just trades into it a little bit.
    *   The analyst attempts to buy two contracts if the price provides the opportunity but prefers to leave the order open.
    *   If the order remains unfilled, it reinforces the expectation of movement towards **11,050-11,060**.
*   Facetiously pre-typing "lol" (laugh out loud) and the analyst jokes that this may be causing a delay.
    *   Had the analyst not typed it, the price would have already moved up.
*   Two contracts are taken off, with the partial stop remaining in place.
    *   The analyst awaits further upside expansion.
*   The current price level is described as a "speed bump" rather than resistance.
    *   Refers to Jason Stapleton's strategy of using candle bodies as resistance for short selling, contrasting it with algorithmic understanding.
    *   The algorithm is expected to expand *through* this area.
*   Dimming out previous annotations to reduce visual clutter, but keeping them visible for reference.
    *   Focus shifts to watching how the price runs above the current level.
*   The intention is to trim down to one contract at a time.
    *   Looking for significant candle expansion.
    *   Planning to take three contracts off above the **11,018.25** level.
    *   Stresses that the order is not being clicked for three contracts all at once, but rather peeling one off at a time.
    *   The analyst aims to gravitate towards the **11,048** level, noting the presence of buy-side liquidity.
*   Three contracts are peeled off.
    *   Leaving five contracts remaining.
*   The analyst considers moving the stop loss up, since two partials have been taken.
    *   The stop loss is locked in at **37.95**, with the expectation of gravitating towards the highlighted area.
*   Three contracts will be removed above this level.
    *   Communicating what will be done *before* it's executed.
*   Five contracts remain.

## Running Down Equity and Order Execution

*   Running down Equity is the principle.
    *   When digging into pools of liquidity, indiscriminate taking of profits is not the goal.
    *   Contrasts this detailed approach with quicker, less precise methods used when recording alongside other tasks (mentorship lessons).
    *   This example is shown to be exactly how the analyst trades.
*   Contracts are peeled off as candlesticks form and expand.
    *   Not simply dumping the contracts all at once.
    *   Trying to "squeeze as much juice out of the lemon as possible."
    *   Sometimes this works well, other times the market reverses.
    *   In case of reversal, the analyst may exit or even add more to the position.
    *   The analyst is not looking to add anything here.
*   The analyst reminds viewers that there are buy stops resting above, near relative equal highs, which the algorithm will target.
    *   Three contracts will be peeled off in the same way as before, above **11,018.25**.
*   Stresses the use of real-time TradingView data.
    *   Reiterates that this cannot be faked with Market Replay.
    *   Order numbers and executions are visible and authentic.
*   One contract is taken off.
    *   Watching for expansion.
    *   Another one is taken off.
    *   Waiting to see if more movement can be squeezed from the candle, anticipating a move towards **11,048**.
*   A third contract is removed, leaving two contracts.
*   Equity is "run down" with each new high achieved, one contract is peeled off.
*   The analyst watches to see if it can get up into the volume imbalance (shaded yellow/orange area).
    *   Highlighting "focus all the way up here daily volume imbalance."
*   The analyst considers the consequences if the price fails here and hits the stop loss.
    *   The analyst states they don't care as a significant portion of the move has already been captured.
    *   Entry was precise and logical.
    *   Partial profits were taken at logical levels where smart money would engage (liquidity zones).
*   Expecting a run-up into the highlighted area.
*   Reference to a small video posted on Twitter and YouTube earlier in the day.
    *   Addressing the issue of others stealing credit for the analyst's content.
    *   Expressing distaste for the disrespect and urging the trading community to condemn such behavior.
    *   Highlighting the importance of verifying the source of content.
*   Moving the stop up aggressively.
*   The bulk of the trade has already been secured.
*   A missed opportunity is noted where one more contract should have been removed to create a higher high.
    *   However, the decision was made to show that these orders are present, not added after the fact.
    *   Orders are flashed on and off to demonstrate real-time data and execution.
*   Changing the view from dollar terms to ticks for viewers who prefer it.
    *   The analyst clarifies that this isn't about flexing.
    *   These are not "40 tick trades," but "monster several hundred tick trades."
    *   This represents a "championship level great Trader," not a "nickel and Diamond dollar menu Trader."
*   The daily volume imbalance is identified as the trade's terminus or final target.

## Final Target and Trade Management Considerations

*   The analyst acknowledges that, as most viewers already know, the trade will be stopped out after one contract is taken off.
*   The analyst feels that the trade is failing.
*   Another opportunity to take one off is missed.
*   The analyst says they really wanted to see it either stop them out quickly or run up and hit their limit order, ending the trade.
*   Expressing frustration with trading late on FOMC or Non-Farm Payroll week, but doing so to teach.
*   The analyst states that they don't like trading like this because the moves are not as clean.
*   The moves usually trade much faster running to their target.
*   The analyst refers to the fact this is a one-minute chart, and these candles are lethargic.
*   Hoping at the time of this right here that it springs up air and snaps into that **11,075.50** level and allow them to get the limit order on the last two contracts.
*   Noting equal highs, the analyst considers what to do if the price goes above them.
*   There is a consideration to "collapse" and be done.
*   The fear is that not holding for the target would make them look like a weak mentor.
*   Decision is made to commit to either hitting the target or being stopped out.
*   Because where it's at right now the analyst states that they could care less, as it is a beautiful run and you have to protect it.
*   Stresses the importance of understanding how to trail stop losses.
*   Criticizes those who waffle on live streams with nonsense about why markets do this and do that.
*   The analyst states that others say that trailing stop losses are nonsense and that you shouldn't be worrying about it.
*   If you are going to be taking down several hundred (600, 500) tick trades, trailing stop losses are necessary.
*   The analyst takes off one contract to reduce the likelihood of getting stopped out on the full two remaining contracts.
*   The analyst states that they now don't really care whatsoever if it trades up, up to their limit, or takes their stop, because they have nine contracts "in the bank."
    *   The analyst jokes the bank is proverbial and states it is a paper trade.
*   Another missed opportunity is highlighted at the relative equal high (the line drawn across them).
    *   If it trades above that, they could collapse it there and be done.
    *   However, that might look like they cannot hold for their target.
*   The decision is made to let it take their stop or hit their target.
*   The importance of protecting profits is emphasized, along with understanding how to trail stop losses.
*   Criticizes traders who place stops without a real understanding of price action.
*   Contrasts this with their own 30 years of experience, allowing for clear understanding of market movements.
    *   The analyst emphasizes they are not bragging, but using contrast.

# NASDAQ 100 Futures Analysis: Further Insights into Trading Methodology

## Trade Management Transparency and Real-Time Execution

*   The analyst highlights the importance of real-time trade management and execution, contrasting it with the presentation of historical trade logs.
    *   Showing a trade log isn't proof of skill; *anyone can create a fabricated record*.
    *   True skill is demonstrated by *executing trades with logical reasoning* during live or paper trading sessions.
    *   Consistent application of a trading strategy that leads to *targets being hit and partial profits being taken* is undeniable proof.
*   The analyst is using the TradingView platform to demonstrate.
    *   The trading being carried out can't be faked.
    *   This isn't because the analyst wouldn't, but rather because the platform doesn't allow it.
*   The analyst identifies the strategy being utilized as their Market Maker Buy Model.
    *   More information can be found on their Scout Sniper Series on YouTube.
    *   Order Block Theory and the Market Maker Buy and Sell Models were introduced in the series.
*   The price action came very close to the stop loss.
    *   Forex would have stopped the analyst out.
    *   Index futures are more precise and forgiving than Forex.
    *   The analyst has no desire to return to Forex trading for personal use.
    *   Forex analysis may still be provided throughout the year for viewers.
*   The reasoning for not returning to Forex is related to Central Bank Digital Currencies.
    *   The analyst believes CBDCs will significantly impact both crypto and Forex markets.
    *   Exposure to these potential risks is something the analyst seeks to avoid.
    *   The analyst prefers to trade in markets with which they have extensive experience.
    *   This includes trading bonds and the S&P in the early 1990s.
    *   Many of today's educators or profitable traders were either in elementary school or not even born when the analyst was trading the S&P.
*   The analyst had an opportunity to peel off the last contract just above a relative equal high.
    *   There was a trend line, not fully extended, that highlighted this potential exit point.
    *   This was the "last line of defense."
    *   The price needed to either run to the target or, if it ran above the relative equal high to the left and failed, the trade would be closed.
    *   The latter event did, in fact, occur.
*   The analyst underlines the need to get your position funded.
    *   Taking partial profits along the way is crucial.
    *   Your mindset needs to shift to where there are no real consequences for being stopped out.
    *   There should be no emotional commitment to the results at this point.
*   The opportunity to peel off the contracts was missed.
    *   In a real, live-traded account, the analyst would have executed this action due to impatience.
    *   With the time approaching noon, there was an anticipation of a lunchtime retracement, which ultimately occurred and triggered the stop.
*   The trade was managed with a trailing stop loss, which was placed with careful consideration.
    *   The trade yielded over 500 ticks.
*   The analyst reiterates the transparency of the live executions.
    *   Nothing is changed or manipulated.
    *   Everything, including price booking and trade management, is shown from the lowest point, as it would appear on TradingView.
    *   There is no trickery, fraud, or reliance on rented MT4 servers.
*   The analyst criticizes those who can't trade with precision.
    *   These individuals often create "nonsense and stories" to justify collective hate or cancellation campaigns.
*   The analyst is choosing to invest their time in the trading community for free.
    *   Doing so rather than earning millions by teaching.
    *   Viewers are encouraged to take advantage of the opportunity.
    *   This level of dedication won't be ongoing indefinitely.
*   The analyst is accommodating requests for real-time data, live demonstrations, and calls.
    *   This commitment will extend throughout the year, but some will still doubt the authenticity.
*   The analyst concludes that the results achieved on this FOMC day were satisfactory.
*   The analyst will show the relationship of how the US 100 cfd (non-us Trader like if you're using mt4 broker type thing and you can't trade the featured contract in the U.S) performed.
    *   The analyst states that the trade was a paper trade.
    *   The trade moved from $100,000 all the way up to $121,185, representing a 21.1% return on a single trade.
    *   All executions were real and matched what was recorded.
*   The analyst is aware that TradingView may monitor or track their trades.
    *   The analyst states that they do not like this kind of monitoring.
    *   They acknowledge some may view this as paranoid, but it's primarily due to not wanting to be tracked.
    *   It's not about hiding anything.
*   The analyst will show how to build up an account in 2023.
    *   The analyst clarifies that they will not show the "Championship level" trading.
    *   This is because that is a higher level than is promised to viewers.
    *   This will involve showing how to pass a funded account.
    *   Then how to properly manage it.
    *   Viewers should not try to reach for the stars with results such as these because they are not the norm.
*   The analyst describes this "Championship level trading" as showing the inferior competition that they can't even be in the same vicinity or Arena.
*   The analyst says that this is the part that irks people, and that they have always done this with their MT4 demo accounts too.
    *   The analyst states that they do not care.
    *   This is because the more people that know about the analyst, the more likely they are to be able to look into what the analyst is doing.
    *   The analyst would hate to have someone attach some kind of trade copier.
*   The analyst will do examples like this, show their son, or show all of the viewers, and then go in and do a bunch of nonsense trades and delete the account.
    *   The analyst states that they have done this since being on TradingView.
    *   There have been a few times that the analyst did it in private, showing their current mentorship group, and they watched the analyst run up an account there too.
    *   The reason for this is not wanting to be tracked.
    *   This is not about selling signals.
    *   The analyst can clearly do this whenever they want to do it.
    *   It is not imperative that the analyst shows every single trade in an account.
*   The analyst challenges viewers to look at the things that have been shown and all the other examples that have been made public and see if it is not the logic that the analyst has actually taught in the tutorials and all the lectures.
    *   It is the exact logic.
    *   It's not a twisting and contortion of things that make it feel like it's like that, but it's really not.
    *   It's absolutely right out of the lectures, exactly as it was taught.
    *   This is because it is the algorithm.

## Comparison to US 100 CFD and Market Making Signatures

*   The analyst is going to look at closing the US 100.
    *   The analyst will use one that already has notes on it.
    *   Everything being equal, there is the one-minute imbalance.
    *   This is not exactly as mentioned before, doesn't look exactly like the Futures Market, but it's real close to it.
    *   It trades down into it here, rallies up.
*   Here is that fair value Gap after swing high.
    *   There is your shift in Market structure.
    *   The price comes down, hits the top of the one-minute imbalance, and inside of the fair value gap on the one-minute chart.
    *   It should stop; it should not completely close that in rallies.
*   Here's an imbalance here.
    *   It should not completely close them in, leave it open.
    *   It does trade into a little bit, but leaves it open as you would expect and rallies rejection block partial right there.
    *   The analyst points out the week high partial layer relative equal highs that were taken.
    *   Then the price did not do the daily volume of balance.
*   The analyst asks the viewer to look at the respect of it here and where that is coming from.
    *   That's the daily volume imbalance.
*   The analyst confirms that these are the same Market-making signatures in the US 100 for non-US Traders.
    *   Traders should not feel like the analyst doesn't love them anymore for not trading Forex.
    *   Traders can trade with their Forex broker and trade the US 100 or the US 500.
    *   This is tracking very close to it.
    *   It won't be the same price, but it's tracking the same Behavior.
*   It's not going to be perfect or identical, but it's going to be enough for traders to be able to trade it.
*   If you can look at this and see what the analyst is showing, isn't this close enough?
*   If you don't have the opportunity to trade the US futures Market, isn't this good enough to study?
*   The analyst asks viewers to pour themselves into it and look for these types of moves, and they will find them.
*   This is not model 2022 mentorship.
    *   This is the analyst teaching an actual execution based on real Market making.
    *   It's not like cough, it's not anything except for what the analyst has taught in their core content lessons and their sniper series.
    *   This is actually meeting entering on the low risk buy.
*   The analyst points out this is a smart money reversal.
    *   Regional consolidation.
    *   The analyst leaves the challenge to come back up into consolidation distribution redistribution smart money reversal low risk Buy reaccumulation reaccumulation back to the original consolidation where buysight liquidity is.
    *   That's the market maker buy model.
*   Everything that the analyst uses to go long in the NASDAQ futures is what they've taught with these models.
    *   This is an entire model.
    *   You could be a buyer down here, and that could be your entire run right there, and you're done.
    *   Or you could wait for this move here, buy it, and then wait for it to get the relative equal highs and not trade down here.
    *   Or you can buy Here, add here, add here, and then get out.
    *   It's a matter of what it makes sense to you.
*   If it doesn't make sense for you to take the entries the analyst used, that's fine.
*   Don't feel like you have to be able to see every entry and understand why the analyst is doing it.
*   You're going to find over the course of this year there's going to be patterns and setups that the analyst refers to that you already see coming.
*   When you hear the analyst talk about it, you're going to be smiling and grinning much like you are right now because some of you already know what this feels like.
*   You're seeing your model, your setup, your choice setup, that unique thing that's going to make you be consistent treated that you're aspiring to be.
*   Don't let anybody, the analyst included, drive you into one particular approach to entry or time frame or Market.
*   Everything that the analyst is teaching you here Works in Forex, any pair, it works in stocks, it works in Commodities, it works in bonds, it works in currency Futures, it works in obviously index futures.
*   The analyst is not going to co-sign crypto because they don't trade crypto.
*   The analyst has no experience with it except for trading a demo, and that doesn't mean anything.
*   The analyst has traded these markets, US futures, and S&P.
    *   The analyst actually got SMP you know back in 1993; that was the earliest trade they took in that market.
    *   The analyst traded Bonds in 1993.
*   Most of your guys out there to be learning from or try to learn from or pretend to be teachers.
    *   They aren't even born yet.
    *   The other ones that are older that are trying to teach today, they were in elementary school when the analyst was trading these markets.
    *   There are a lot of old Traders than the analyst.
    *   By far and large, the most Talking Heads today that try to be Educators, they haven't been around long enough to know what it is they haven't seen.
    *   Market crashes they haven't seen bubbles except for the crypto bubble.
*   The um, the necessary scarves and trauma that comes from doing it for a long time, they don't have that.
*   You want to learn from somebody that's gone through it insane, the ugly side of all this stuff and Claw their way through it, and that's what the analyst is trying to present to you here, just with three decades of it.
*   If the Lord gives the analyst time to do four decades then great.
*   That fourth decade will be in private because the analyst is just trying to pull themselves out publicly here for the last time.
*   It's up to you to seize upon that opportunity and make the best of it.
*   Once it's gone, this 50-year-old dude that's been talking to you, he's done.
*   The analyst is going to be doing other things in their life that will bring them and their family enjoyment.
*   It won't be that the analyst will miss doing this.
*   The analyst won't be doing it at the pace that you're used to seeing.
*   Hopefully, you found this one in Cyclone that was very long.
*   This is about what the fly session is going to feel like.
*   If you got into this thinking that trading is like those little vignette videos where it only takes two minutes to get money, you're going to be in for a rude awakening because it's a lot of waiting a lot of waiting and weighing and deciding and second guessing and all that stuff normal.
*   Get ready for it because whether you're here live when it's happening or watch it in the recording, it's going to be very, very long, and that's just the way it is.
*   Until next time, be safe.

Good evening folks, welcome back! Let's dive into a review of Friday's price action, focusing on the **E-mini S&P 500 (ES)**.

## **I. Introduction**

We will analyze the ES daily chart. Please note that NASDAQ will not be covered in this review. My analysis will be focused on ES. If you want to see my Twitter analysis, you can find the **official Twitter account of the Instrumental Trader** linked on my YouTube channel's main page in the upper right-hand corner.

### **A. Trading Range Context**

Previously, I mentioned we were inside a trading range. Until we break out of this range, be patient.

### **B. Volume Imbalance Target**

I indicated a **volume imbalance area** that would likely draw the price up into and above the short-term high. This happened as expected on Friday.

### **C. Important Low Levels**

Before I sound too self-congratulatory, it's important to note that these levels were crucial:

*   **3822.5**
*   **3814.5**

I was watching these as potential break points. My target was **3814**.

The low reached **3819** even on the Micro E-mini.

*   **Micro E-mini (MESH2023) even went *below* 3814.**
    *   Check **MESH2023** to see the divergence. The Micro E-mini went lower than the ES. This is a **SMT (Smart Money Technique) Divergence**. MESH2023 went lower than the ES.

### **D. Upside Target**

I mentioned the draw on the upside earlier in the week. You can find it in the YouTube videos. When I annotate a level, *especially* on a daily chart, **keep it visible on *all* timeframes.**

### **E. Understanding the Orange Level**

The orange rectangle you'll see on the lower timeframe charts corresponds to the close of the candle on **December 15, 2022**, and the open of the candle on **December 16, 2022**.

## **II. Hourly Chart Analysis**

Dropping down to the hourly chart.

### **A. Targeting Relative Equal Lows**

You can see relative equal lows and I was looking for a potential drop below them. Specifically, I was watching for that **3814** level based on these old lows.

### **B. Scenario Planning for Non-Farm Payroll**

In the event of a Non-Farm Payroll drop below these lows, I anticipated a draw back up to at a minimum this level, and if acceleration occurred, further upside targets previously mentioned earlier in the week. However, even for a demo trade, I won't hold something to that level on the Non-Farm Payroll date.

### **C. Examining Stop Runs and Target Areas**

*   Nice **sell-side liquidity** resting below these relative equal lows. These lows are the resting place for **sell stops**.
*   Anyone that's long or wants to sell short are trying to make money going down if the market goes lower.
*   If the market goes below that and rejects that, that is a **stop raid**.

Following a stop raid, we'd look for the opposing **buy-side liquidity**. Possible locations would be here, here, and above here. A strong upward move would target the **orange box**, that daily volume imbalance mentioned previously.

## **III. 15-Minute Timeframe Analysis**

Now, let's drop down to the 15-minute timeframe.

### **A. New York Time Zone**

*   Always set your chart to **New York time**.
*   If you've been following my ES commentary on Twitter, you'll notice I'm often 10 minutes ahead of your chart.
*   This proves I'm using live data.
*   You can only trade with live execution with real-time data on TradingView. Delayed data cannot be used for trading. I am doing it with **real-time data** and not delayed data.

### **B. The Midnight Candle**

Focus on **the midnight candle in New York local time**. The level at **3847.5** from that candle will be marked purple.

### **C. Power Three Filter**

**3847.5** will be our filter for Power Three. If we're anticipating a downward move:

*   We want to see a move above it.
*   Then a break back *below* it.
*   Creating a selling opportunity.
*   Then reaching down to **3814**.

We got real close to **3814** (five handles away).

### **D. Non-Farm Payroll Context**

At 8:30 AM (Eastern), we had a run above that level, and I noted it on Twitter. I advised to pay attention to **3814**, as it could easily spike down there. Had it broken 3814 and expanded beyond that, **3804** was also a potential level.

I don't trade this Non-Farm Payroll event because I don't know what they're going to do with the employment number. There is a way to trade the market after that first 30 minutes. This is good for studying price action. I gave an example of walking through it on Twitter, calling the levels and managing the stop and positions and partials. But we failed to go back below this low here.

## **IV. 5-Minute Timeframe Analysis**

### **A. Buy-Side Imbalance, Sell-Side Inefficiency (BISI)**

We have something in the form of a buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency.

*   This means buy-side was offered but inefficient in what sell-side.
*   In other words, it needs to have some movement between this candle's high and that candle's low.
*   Your focus should be this range between this candle's high and this candle's low.
*   If there is only one candle between those two candles, it's this one big caffeinated candle.

Back in the 90s, I would create a big candle like this, I would call it a **caffeine bar**. Every time I want to see an energetic move, my mind goes back to the old days.

Your eye should be gravitating to these types of movements. This is a **buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency**. This is a specific category of a PD array, fair value Gap. The distinction is the **buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency (BISI).**

**Do *not* Google it,** as this is my language and vocabulary. I created this so you can differentiate what I am referring to.

### **B. Rejection and Run to Relative Equal Highs**

We went down into that area here, dipped into it, and then turned around and attacked these relative equal highs.

### **C. Contextualizing 3814**

Right about in here, I tweeted, "Note 3814," because we could have easily spiked back down through here, cleaned this area up, and ran the stops on anyone long with stops below those old 15-minute lows.

If it was able to do that, that's fine; I would have been looking for a run to take these out. But it didn't give me that. Go through my tweets on Friday; you'll see me refer again as it's dropping down, pay attention to 3814.

I want to see proof of what it would likely do if it's not going to go to 3814. If it cannot and it rejects this **buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency**, then there's no trade there. I don't want to sell short, I want to see if it can get to 3814.

**But what does that mean to "reject?"** It's not getting through it. In the easiest language I can provide for you, in regards to that the lowest portion of that range between this candle's low and this candle's high, if any time you have a big one single candle and it's separated with the candle's high before it here and a candle after it's low here and it's just that range that's shaded in blue there's only one pass one candle okay that is significant when price is coming back down into it. But when there's high impact news drivers like Non-Farm Payroll or FMC, it can overshoot these areas.

If I don't have a high-impact news driver like FMC or Non-Farm Payroll, if I'm just studying price and looking at Non-Farm Payroll a couple times throughout this year, just to reinforce the idea of what it is, I try to avoid doing. I'm going to stand in front of you live on a Non-Farm Payroll and do the whole business right in front of you and you'll see why I don't want to touch that day because the elements of precision are likely to be outside my grasp and it's because it's highly manipulated.

If you're forced by compulsion or lack of discipline, you just have to be in here studying on Non-Farm Payroll because you feel drawn to it like a moth to a flame demo it. Don't trade it live and then you'll see quickly why you shouldn't do it.

Because we failed and rejected to go below this level here, you're going to have to drop down to a one-minute chart. The market drops back down. I gave it the likelihood of maybe it ran up in here to get above the opening price, and then does it break below this area here and then tag the 3814 level.

Now if it would have went below 3814, came up into a fair value gap, I would have looked for a run to 3804.

## **V. 1-Minute Timeframe Analysis**

### **A. Refined BISI**

Here's that same buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency. It's been refined to show on just the one-minute chart.

### **B. The Significance of 3839 and 3836.75**

You're going to see a weird tweet where it says, "Put a line on 3839 and 3836.75." I got the level wrong. I read it wrong.

What I was trying to get your attention to was here: If that can stay open. If that stays open, notice it doesn't trade back down into it.

### **C. Analyzing Price Action and Stop Runs**

Here's that area there that stays open. In other words, the price doesn't go down into it and a short-term high is taken out. Here's a short-term high right there.

This stayed open, and this short-term high was taken out to the upside. There's a small little gap right in here.

You're going to see a tweet that I'm going to be able to put right on top of the chart, and you'll see how I'm right here, I'm calling that the 3876 buy stops are in the crosshairs, that means that I'm watching to see if this level stays open, and if we get above the short-term high right there, because if we do, then it's likely to do what? Run to take out these relative equal highs.

Retail traders would see that as resistance. It went up here, stopped, dropped down aggressively so naturally anybody that wants to make money they're going to think get short and as long as it doesn't go above here you're good got a stop loss up there it's fine. I teach my students how to attack retail logic and Theory because it's based on fallacy it's based on things that aren't making the market move higher or lower it's providing Bull's eyes.


Here is the text, restructured and formatted for improved readability, while preserving all original details and nuances.

## **VI. Additional Context and Analysis**

### **A. Liquidity Hunting and Market Dynamics**

You're going to see a lot of educators – if you haven't already – and I get a lot of this from other educators, you know, they'll talk about my opinion of the marketplace and they'll say what I'm saying is flawed logic. They'll say things like, "Nobody's hunting your stop." Well, that's not true. Because if that were true, then you wouldn't see my concepts be as precise as they are.

The market is delivered on the basis of:

*   **Liquidity**
*   **Balanced rebalance**

That's it. That's the only thing that's happening. Otherwise, it's some kind of unexpected event where manipulation comes in, where nobody can determine what it's going to do, and you're going to lose regardless if you're in the marketplace. That's unfortunate, that's what happens sometimes, but that's the inherent risk. That's what everybody takes on when they speculate in these markets with real money.

### **B. Power Three Strategy and Midnight Opening Price**

When the market does in fact trade above the short-term high here, any retracements down into this area here—what area? This candle here, from the high to the opening price at that dotted line. What is that dotted line again? That's the midnight opening price in New York time on Friday. So Power Three is what we're now thinking it's going to go to here. You'll see proof of that because I've tweeted it, and you can still see the tweets. I haven't been changing. I don't delete any tweet. No tweets being deleted ever.

As it drops back down into this candle's high to open, I'm getting real close to the midnight opening price on Friday. So that means I'm doing what? I'm going to try to buy at or just below the opening price at midnight, because my expectation is this. This is what I teach my students.

### **C. Daily Chart Perspective**

If this is what the range is likely to do on the daily chart, in order to this hypothetical candlestick, okay, let's say this hypothetical candlestick represents the daily chart, okay, and I use obviously green. So let's use this here. Okay, so we have this scenario here where we're expecting the opening price.

Now again, think about this candle on the daily timeframe. Right now, we're looking at a one-minute chart, so don't be confused by this. Okay, I'm just showing the logic. The opening price would be this price right here.

### **D. Addressing Misconceptions and Mentorship**

What's confusing for some of you is because you haven't been properly mentored. You just listen to other people take my stuff and teach you incorrectly because they're not paying attention, they're not taking notes, and they haven't learned how to trade profitably with the concepts, so I'm trying to correct all of you. Okay, I know you're overzealous and you want to go out make your courses and your mentorships and all that other stuff, but you're actually hurting people. Okay, so there's a lot of reasons why I'm doing what I'm doing this last year, but pay attention.

Because if you're trying to rip me off and rebrand my stuff, at least do the benefit of helping the people that's going to be affected by you teaching my stuff incorrectly by doing it at least better than you used to. And that means by doing this: the opening price at midnight New York local time, that is your daily opening price. I don't care what TradingView's opening price is when you put on the daily chart and look at the daily candle's opening price. That's not accurate. Okay, that's hours and hours away from what it is that the algorithm is going to refer to. You want to have New York at midnight. That opening price, just pull up a 15-minute timeframe and you'll have it. So you want to have that price noted. That's what I have here. Remember, we walked from the 50-minute chart and extended it out in time.

### **E. Bullish Scenario and Trading Strategy**

If we're bullish, by having this level on your chart, you want to be buying at that level or beneath it. In worst-case scenario, you want to be buying near it. So your thought process would be like this: on the daily chart you'll watch and you'll see me doing this with live commentary starting in February where I'm expecting the accumulation phase on the daily range to occur below a specific level and you'll see how it's you're in a 90 Club. Okay, if you if you do these types of things and your draw on liquidity was that...

### **F. Example Scenario: Target 3895.25**

Well, let's just say this level up here was the 3895 and a quarter level. Don't be discouraged or distracted by the actual prices over here, but let's just say that was your draw on liquidity. Okay, I don't want to be unrealistic and say that you would have known about the volume and balance had you not been watching the videos, if you want to watch the videos, and obviously you would have. But let's just say that was your draw on liquidity for buy-side based on the weekly chart, based on what you expected in terms of higher timeframe analysis.

I can say this because you watched me do it this week, even though I was looking for something down here. It matters not. What I'm showing you is the logic as how I shifted gears intraday Friday and worked in this whole scenario here. But you would be trying to buy below the midnight opening price on any day. Don't think this is just a Non-Farm Payroll event. You're trying to buy at the opening price or below on the daily candle when you're bullish.

### **G. Identifying Market Structure Shifts**

If you get above the opening price, like you see it doing here and here, as it goes back close to that opening price, you can be a buyer there too if there's logic behind it. And the logic I used was these two down-closed candles is a bullish order block. It's also a swing high. We went through it here. So this is what I teach you to look for for what the shift in market structure, meaning the market has tipped its hand to you that it wants to go higher.

### **H. High Probability Targets**

If it's going to go higher, where it's going to go to? Well, you have an imbalance right here, right? Yeah, it's fine. You have a bearish breaker here. That's fine, too. But look closely. Actually, take a step away from your computer screen, back up in your room right now. Look at this chart a little bit further away, about 10-12 feet away. You're going to see these levels here way too smooth. It looks too perfect. It looks too much like classic support and resistance.

### **I. Smooth Edges and Algorithmic Behavior**

Here's a note that you want to have in your study journal. Anytime you see levels in your chart that are like this or they're just too perfect and smooth, I always say this, okay, but smooth edges like to be made jagged. That means when it's smooth like this, the market will rip into that and make it jagged. It doesn't like to have smooth highs and smooth lows. It will always, always find a way to go back into those levels.

It may not happen right away, may not happen the same trading day, but it will always look to go into those levels again. That's what the algorithm does. So let's go back to our analogy. Let's assume that this level here is this level right there on the daily chart. So at that level, for whatever reason, we think there's something up here that is going to be a draw on price. Okay, liquidity up there is making the highest probability that the market will want to gravitate to that level and that this happens to be on our daily chart. That's the level you would have.

### **J. Intraday Shifting and Range Analysis**

While you're watching price when it's down here like this, meandering around like it was doing here, I'm not paying attention to all of this. This is all based on the reaction to 8:30 in the morning, Non-Farm Payroll. So I'm not worried about this price action. I look at this and ignore it. I want to see where the real range is. It's here. Then they did this fake run. Okay, it looks like it's going to break this.

If it doesn't and tears off, goes lower into our buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency, then we wait. Does it break lower? I'm not chasing it. I'm just observing it. I'm watching. I told you, note 3814, see if you can get down there. It didn't want to do it. Then it rallies away, leaves this area in here.

### **K. Clarifying Price Levels: 3839 and 3836.75**

I gave you the two wrong price action levels. If you look at this low here, you're looking at this price right there. If you look at this candle's low, it's 3838.25 and I said 3839, I believe is what I tweeted, and it was inaccurate. I apologize. 3839.25 is wrong. And I was looking at this level here, the high 3836.75, so that's what I was looking for. I was watching, obviously, you knew I'm looking at a one-minute chart. I was commenting over a one-minute chart, but I wanted you to have that on your chart.

### **L. Importance of Key Levels**

I told you to have a line on this level and this level. Reason why? Because I was going to come back and talk about this level today more specifically. I was going to do it Friday, but I didn't have the time to deal. But I apologize, but the market wasn't able to get down to that, and then with this short-term high, it breaks above it. So there's a shift in market structure there.

### **M. Focusing on the Current Dealing Range**

I'm looking at all of this area here below the opening price, and now this level is this conceptually in my mind. In my mind, this is what I'm seeing the algorithm refer to. I am not, I don't care about this. I don't care about every candle prior to that. See, when you're looking at price action, you're getting caught up in all of this noise. My focus, my absolute focus, is only here, right there inside that box. That's what I'm focusing on.

### **N. Algorithmic Framework**

That's the initial framework that the algorithm is going to work within. Why? Because that's the dealing range. This is where we are. This is where we made the high for the day. We've left liquidity in place on in the form of buy-side. We've broke down back into a discount. We have not went lower. We create a short-term high. This range was not closed in or even retreated to. Then we had a short-term high broke there with this candle moving higher.

So in my mind, I'm thinking this level here, this line represents this here. So I'm looking at the daily range like this even though, okay, that we have traded up here and we've already essentially been here. I don't care. I'm thinking about it just like the algorithm will if we want to personify the algorithm.

### **O. External Range Liquidity**

When it's coded to refer to an old dealing range, that's what this is here. This high to low, I believe it's going to do what? Expand outside of that range in the form of external range liquidity. It's going to go outside the boundaries created by this high and that low in the form of an up move.

### **P. Importance of Tracking Tweets**

You'll see me tweet if you go through Friday's tweets and you also see me actually copy a tweet's link and you can put them in your TradingView chart. Just copy my tweet or anybody else's tweet and right click on the uh the chart somewhere and click paste after you copy the link of any particular Twitter post, especially mine because you want to be able to hold me accountable. Everything I say on Twitter, go through each day and post what it is I drew your attention to. I'm not deleting anything. You'll never see me delete a tweet. It will never happen. If I'm right, you're going to see it. If I'm wrong, you're going to see it. It is what it is. I'm out here without a safety net, okay? I'm walking the high wire and I had no shame or fear of it, okay? It is what it is.

### **Q. Non-Farm Payroll Disclaimer**

I'm also teaching that Non-Farm Payroll is a day that you don't want to be trading. So I really wanted to do poorly well not from hero so I can say see that's why so don't don't read into what I'm about to show you because I don't think that it's me saying in secret no we don't okay we're not trying to do that. But you can practice it and it's fine.

### **R. Focused Price Action Analysis**

This little segment of price action, that's the focus. That's the setup. That's the only thing that you would need to be concerned about at the moment. You don't worry about the hourly chart, you don't worry about the four-hour chart, you're not worried about the daily chart, you're not worried about the weekly chart, you're not worried about the 15, the 10 minute, the seven minute, the three minute, the two minute. This is it. This is the framework right here.

### **S. Setting the Stage for Upside Potential**

The fact that it shifted above this short-term high right there sets the stage for a run above here. Okay, and I don't know and you didn't know that it was going to go up to 3896 and a quarter.

### **T. Managing Positions and Targets**

Once it got above this level here, I took 10 contracts off of a 12 contract position and I left two contracts on. By having that run above that 3876 and a quarter level, I drew your attention on Twitter to 3895 for buy-side and then I had a limit order at 3896 and a quarter and it reached up in there and did its business. I also had 3885 noted, it's a old daily high as well and you can find that level on your daily chart go back over the course of last week and you'll see previous day's highs 3885 was another level that I tweeted. Okay, I'm not going to have that tweet on the chart because it becomes too much, but you're welcome to go through my tweets and whenever I'm giving you key levels or things that I'm looking for for the day drop them on your chart after the fact.

### **U. Educational Value of Retrospective Analysis**

If you're in school, if you're running a business, or if you're working your job and you can't do it live when I'm doing it, it's educational for you to see where on the chart I was saying it and then find the things I'm teaching you. Okay, and trust me, by doing that, it will provide you a better perspective on what it is that was being done at the time. Even though you don't have the benefit of being there right then, at least this is the closest thing you'll have to seeing what it is I was trying to draw your attention to.

### **V. Daily Candle Visualization and Strategy**

Back to this example, if it's inside this... let me go back here... if I'm just looking at this shade layer here... let me do this... so inside that and it's not a nice color... I'm looking at this shaded area in here and I believe it's likely to go from here, if it takes out this high, from here up to here. So I'm envisioning the daily candle looking like this right now, even though we've already been here and came down. Right now, the algorithm is thinking, okay, we're real close to the opening price at midnight, which is right there. We ran above it, so it did this. It went up a little bit and now we're back down inside the middle of the range that would be represented by this low to this high.

Then when it drops back down, it's getting real close to that opening price again. So it's doing something like this. Okay, and I'm anticipating that the daily range will now expand up into this level here where buy-side would be, which is represented by this high here. That's why this red line is being annotated on the chart.

### **W. Anticipating Market Gravitation and Smooth Edges**

I'm expecting price to keep gravitating higher and that would be something like here and then continuously gravitating towards that high like it's doing here. I'm not getting tricked into thinking it's going to go down. This level is way too clean being, it's smooth, it's like relatively equal highs. The market's not going to leave that.

### **X. Confidence in Target 3876.25 and Final Thoughts**

I actually tweet also. I said I do believe we're going to go to 3876.25 because it's so close it would be criminal to leave it intact. Okay, so all this time it's dropping down, I'm not worried about it not going up there. So it gives you the confidence to stay with the idea and then finally when it runs above it like that, this is what the daily candle looks like and I'm going to watch and see does it keep digging into my next objective which would be an old high at 3885.

So with 3885 which being an old daily high, there's buy-side above that. Why do I know that? It's just the way it is. Large funds like the used previous days highs and lows so that liquidity is real. It's not theoretical. It's not something like you see on a DOM, a depth of Market ladder or something to that effect.


Here is the text, restructured and formatted for improved readability, while preserving all original details and nuances.

## **Analysis of Liquidity, Market Dynamics, and Trading Strategies**

### **A. Depth of Market (DOM) and Order Book Analysis**

I'm not a fan of using the Depth of Market (DOM) for analysis because those things can be spoofed. Fund managers are not pulling their orders in and out. Okay, they're placing them there, they're hard orders, and it's going to be what it is. It's going to run to them.

*   That's why that type of perspective on where liquidity is –
    *   old daily highs for buy stops,
    *   old daily lows for sell stops –

And you can make a lot of money trading those types of pools of liquidity. They can act as targets, and it can act as a framework for entries.

### **B. Trade Execution and Target Levels**

Okay, so as you can see, the market does in fact trade up to there as well. I took a partial there, and then it left one contract on for **3896 and a quarter**, that level being the next draw. You'll see a tweet about it. The whole time it's doing this expansion up higher and higher, we're not thinking, "Oh, it's going to collapse and reverse," because the candle, if it's going to have a big move like this, it's probably going to close near or at its daily high.

Now, think about that, because if you can do this, you can hold on to the last hour of trading, which would be **3:00 PM**. And then something happens at **3:00 PM.** I've already taught you, or I've introduced to you, where the market can come back into its range, and I want you to see it like this.

### **C. Daily Volume Imbalance and Market Respect**

We can see that it goes up into that daily volume and balance. Remember that orange rectangle I drew on the daily chart time frame? It goes right up into it. Look at the bodies of the candle respecting the top end of that. Then it drops back down into the low end of it, bounces around, hangs in there, and then leaves it. See that? And here is **3:00 PM** right there.

So, if your target happened to be this daily volume imbalance, that could look like something like this.

### **D. Visualizing the Daily Range and Trade Confidence**

So, in your mind's eye, and tracking what the daily range would look like on a daily chart, I mean, you would obviously have a daily chart referred to throughout the day. That gives you the confidence to stay with the trade. Because I get a lot of questions all the time, "How do I stay in these trades? How do I not get shaken out of them?" Because I'm thinking like this, because this is my concept of **Power Three**.

### **E. Power Three Concept: Accumulation, Manipulation, Distribution**

**Power Three** is:

*   **Accumulation:** Smart money is doing longs at that time.
*   I didn't know for certain; I have to wait for **8:30 AM** to come in.
*   **Manipulation:** Then it will tip its hand.

I just walked you through that based on that short-term high being broken and the inefficiency for the market to fill in that buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency.

### **F. Shifting Focus and Target Adjustments**

**3814** was no longer a factor. In the tweets, I took your attention to now we're going to look for:

*   **3876 and a quarter**,
*   then we're going to look for **3885**,
*   and then we're going to look for **3896 and a quarter**.

Then it unfolded like a script.

### **G. Daily Candle Visualization and Noise Filtration**

So, in my mind, I'm thinking this is the daily candle. I'm not being swayed by all the little minor fluctuations on these one-minute candles, which is what makes everybody think that it's noise. It's not noise; it's the same price that the candle is using to make the daily chart candlestick. This is a matter of knowing the rules of engagement and knowing that, okay, once we get to the last hour, **3:00 PM**, if it gets to a target like that, be done. Be content with that, because it's likely to do what? It's likely to pull back into the range and create a little bit of wick at the top end of the candle.

### **H. Daily Candle Approximation**

So, inside this little area now, this little retracement, and it closes off the high. So, if this is the high... The high here, we're going to say, is that. And it might pull off and then close trading for the day right there, that closing price.

So, we see it over here:

*   here's the high,
*   short-term low,
*   it breaks,
*   comes back up into a volume imbalance,
*   we're just going to tag sell-side right below here, boom,
*   where's it close?

Off the high there. So, it looks like this for the daily candle. Okay, and we're very close to it, because it's not the best in terms of scale, it won't look exactly like that, but conceptually, it's obviously the best I can do artistically.

### **I. Referencing The Daily Chart Example**

For the purposes of looking at the daily chart, let's look at the daily candle now. And there it is.

Okay, so obviously, if you're new, this is the first time you've watched a video from me, and you're looking at this one, it's going to look like, "Oh, well, you know, anybody can do what you're doing. You're talking about it after the fact."

### **J. Validating Predictions and Market Levels**

No, go back a couple days ago, last week, and you'll see me actually refer to this level right there and that's where it's going to draw to, which would be above this high here. The next high would be what? This one. So, there's buy-side above that, and there's the little volume and balance.

### **K. Unique Teaching Methodology**

You don't see this taught in books, folks. Okay? It's not classic support and resistance. It's not Sam Seiden's supply and demand stuff. Okay? Chris Lori doesn't teach this. Larry Williams doesn't even know anything about it. Okay? Nobody, nobody's teaching this but me.

### **L. Correct Learning Sources**

I want you to understand that if I had a way of showing you where to find this information quicker without having to do all this work, I would do it. Okay? Believe me, I would do it, but it doesn't exist anywhere else.

So, when I codified these concepts, these things are going to be shown and taught correctly from me. There's no other outside source but me. So, I want you to learn it correctly that way you're not going to hurt other people trying to be smart and pretend that you can run a mentorship when you don't even know what you're doing. All right, so here's the one-minute chart.

### **M. Tweet Verification and Real-Time Analysis**

This is the best I could come up with conceptually, going through the individual fluctuations. This chart, with the exception of the actual tweets you see here, you can see the times. Okay, and don't take this for what it is being shown here; these are actual links to the tweets.

*   If I click on this right here, it'll take me to the direct link here.
*   If I click on this one, it will take me to this tweet here.
*   If I clicked on this one, it'll take me to that one.

Just go back and look at **Friday, January 6, 2023,** at these respective times, New York local time, and you will see that these tweets are in fact right there.

### **N. Live Stream Schedule and Educational Focus**

**3876 buy stops**. What is that? That's right here, folks. If I can't see it, I would not be able to do this. Okay? I'm not going to always be on live streams, obviously. I've only committed to two a week, but once I get one good move for the week, I'm done. Then I'll do something like this for the other day.

I don't want to be caught up in doing live streams all the time. Okay, and I don't want to create the opportunity for you to fall into a dependency on it, because I'm only trying to teach you to do one good setup per week, and I know somebody's like, "Oh, well, we need to see..." No, we don't need to do anything except for practice. That's what we need to do.

### **O. Teaching Through Tweets and Market Coverage Limitations**

Okay, I can do this, and it's not for you to be copying because that's exactly what some of you are wanting to do, but I can teach this effectively through tweets, too, and this is proof of that.

Now, the drawdown on this, or drawback, should be is I won't be able to show, like, the **US 500 cfd**, and a lot of you are not able to get the real-time data or trade this Futures Contract. Yes, I will on my live streams find a way to toggle back and forth between **ES 500** and I'm sorry, not **ES 500**, **US 500** and **Es Futures Contract** interchangeably.

Okay, so if I'm looking at something that is on **ES**, I'll flip over to the **US 500** to kind of give you guys that are following along on that at least the Baseline idea where we're studying and practicing. Okay, and the same thing for **Nasdaq**. If we're looking at **NASDAQ** or **NQ Futures Contract**, then I would be showing you the **us-100 cfd**, okay, so or the equivalent, you know, but there's I can't trade the Futures Contract.

### **P. Market Structure and Order Flow Analysis**

All right, so let's get through this because I got a lot of things I want to cover here and then give you my opinion on Forex. I know some of you just don't care about this Market here as much as it is a beautiful Market to trade, but here's the buy side of balance outside inefficiency.

Over here, let's scrub back here for a moment. Here's a high with a low prior to it and a lower low, so that's a bullish breaker. So, it's not on my chart because I'm doing all this stuff, commentary, monitoring it, and trying to screen capture and share things on Twitter. It's a lot to manage and a lot to do, and I don't have the time. I don't have the benefit of time to do all the things and you type out all this stuff here and you see when I do my recordings it's I have no time to do anything else but just that.

### **Q. Identifying Market Structure and Order Flow**

What I was watching is down here when it came down to this breaker and it right above this short-term high there I was trying to prompt you all on Twitter but I gave the wrong levels and all you got to do is put those levels up I tweeted in and you'll see they make absolutely no sense there is no fair value gap on those levels but I was trying to draw your attention to this so it was a typo during the Heat of the Moment and it is what it is.

This short-term High here I was looking at this short-term High being broken right on this candle here the same way I'm telling you this one when it came through it there that's a Dead Ringer it's going right here okay and you can see that by me tweeting at **3876 buy stops in the crosshairs** right there as that candle is dropping down bang right into the order block this short term high is a shift in Market structure now I have two what two shifts in Market structure this short term High here and this Gap stayed open then we have a shift in Market structure above this this high with this candle right there and we have this fair value Gap left open when this thing starts to run higher I'm confident that I'm on side.

### **R. Institutional Order Flow**

What do I mean by that I'll show you in a second just settle them then we have a order block here with this drop down the market accumulates around that's what this little trend line is here on the opening price and we have a fair value guide so it a little shorter block trades through it again it's a retrade then it leaves it then comes back down and it becomes what a reclaimed order block there Okay so this is not institutional order flow entry drill institutional workflow entry drill is when you have an open range in the form of a fair value Gap and it drops down one tick below the framework of the high like it does here.

### **S. High Frequency Trading and Position Management**

Look at this candle's low you're looking at that price right there this candle is low as what **3877** in half this candle here trades down into what **3877** and a quarter that's institutional order flow integral that's mine that's my name don't Google because you're not gonna find anything about it what's actually happening is it's high frequency Trading it's being entered there okay there's nothing more I can teach you about it except for the fact that if I trust the fact that these ranges are not going to close in I'm going to use that as another area to build a partial and pill you know build a pyramid position larger in the event that I do it wrong I can still be a buyer here and do a pyramid entry I'm not saying I did it here but I'm just saying that in other instances where you see me doing my recordings and I'm recording my management and stop placement and building another entry in to build the position bigger sometimes I'm buying what I believe is institutional order flow entry drill and it goes down and closes in the fair value Gap I'm not intimidated by that it's okay it just gives me the opportunity to get in and then if I have room or leverage still in my equity in my position if it goes down to the lower end I can buy again one more time so whatever position I put here I'll duplicate that here so I want to say it was dropping back down here I could be a buyer of one contract say I may have six here um three here two here and then I'll do one here but if it drop down one more time I'll do one more that's the low end of that fair value Gap I won't do two or anything higher than I'll just do the same thing I did on the lowest new pyramid entry and it won't be that big of a deal because I have all of the equity behind all these positions still in my favor supporting it so I don't look at it as adding to a losing position because I'm already stacked with all this Equity from here to here and all up to here and I've already taken a partial here and a partial here so I'm not going to Pyramid.

### **T. Tweet Analysis and Chart Screenshots**

I want to move like this which is why you're going to ask okay well when would you not want a pyramid as you'll see I took a partial here the largest portion of it and a partial here and the last portion came off here so just look at these tweets **3876 buy stops are in a crosshairs** that's this **3876** is the high side liquidity buy stops and buy side liquidity is the same thing interchangeably in the crosshairs means it's likely to go up there okay that's what my language is implying there and then this tweet Follow The Line to it goes right up to that candle right there what's the time of that candle look down here what's the time on that candle **1008. 1008** I believe **38.76** and a quarter is the next draw on liquidity I would want to see big move with speed above **38.75** when's that occurring right there and **38.75** is right there right there right there and what do we get expansion through we got it and we have a fair value Gap at Old highs I can't add because I've already taken two partials off I've taken profits partials twice now with this candle running above here in this candle right above here and then finally screenshot your one minute es chart here where right on that very candle so at **1036** yeah **10 36** I got this already I'm sorry **10 36** candles right there up down at the bottom of the chart right down here okay **10 36**.

### **U. Visualization & Execution Analysis**

On that candle I'm saying at that moment as it's going through it you want to screenshot that because it'll help you Trust holding on positions even if you get out of your paper trade because you can't handle it still screenshot your chart if you have the ability to do it when it happens and goes to your levels that you called for in your own analysis and to prove okay look over here there's no executions right see any any arrows popping up okay now I'm gonna move this over right in this figure how you got in this fairy god favorite you got in the bullish order block reclaimed order block you want to see it stay open the partial running above here the other partial here and the other partial here so when it runs above it gives me my **10** contracts in the last two come off at logical places where **3085** that was the level I gave in a tweet which doesn't appear here in my example but you can see it it's just too many things that pop up on this chart and just show it as I want to see it and then finally getting up into **38 96** and a quarter okay and that my friends is no other arrows see that right in here right in here right in here here here and here all the levels and look see them okay no trickery here I'll move the chart around so you can see that it's not Photoshop and it is what it is they won't they won't get wider either they're not drawn arrows as another person say oh you're drawing the arrow if it's strong they'll be wider and they'll move farther away they stay in the same position all the time and drawn arrows don't give you the little tick down here where you actually get down that when you hover over top of it and it doesn't give you the pop-up where you actually executed so if that doesn't work when you consider that now does it all right folks and that'll be it for today hope you found this one insightful I'm sure I'll be talking to you through Twitter and other YouTube Productions be safe.

# Index Futures Review - January 9, 2023

## Introduction
Hi folks, welcome back. This is our index futures review and, as you can see, we had a pretty dynamic day today. Let's dive into the details.

## Bearish Breaker Analysis
*   I'm going to direct your attention to this down closed candle.
*   Note the high and this higher high.
*   This pattern – **high, low, higher high** – this is my **bearish breaker**.
*   (Music) Okay, so we can see how inside of this imbalance, you can use that.
*   Yes, I'm looking at this breaker as well.
*   The reason I didn't call any higher level than **39.69** today is directly tied to this breaker.
    *   Could it have gone higher? Absolutely.
    *   Did I hold to 39.69? No, I got stopped out prematurely.
    *   I had to get away from the computers as my attention was needed elsewhere.
    *   Long story short, I got knocked out. It is what it is.
*   I mainly something for you today walk you through it minute by minute on Twitter and you're welcome to go through the tweets on **January 9 2023**.
    *   They're all there.
    *   Nothing edited.
    *   Nothing deleted.

### Breaker vs. Order Block/Imbalance

*   Contrast this breaker where the market goes up into that, which is mean threshold.
    *   Half of an order block is mean threshold.
    *   Half of an imbalance, like this here to here, that is consequent encouragement.
*   Several things to note:
    *   Half of this range is approximately right here.
    *   Half of the breaker is right there.

## Hourly Chart Analysis and Key Levels

*   Add to that, once we drop down to the hourly chart, the levels I gave you this morning before the market started gyrating.
*   Some of you are asking: "Okay, that's great and all, but what's it gonna do next?"
*   I'm watching how we react on **this candle** here.
    *   This open on this candle here is what I'm watching.
    *   That is a potential order block that I like.
    *   We'll see if it wants to get down to that and show some kind of respect there.
*   If it doesn't:
    *   This one here, mean threshold of that candle right there, is the last line in the sand.
    *   If it fails to hold price higher, then we're most likely going to attack the sell side here.
*   It would need to get back above half of this Wick on a closing basis for me to feel bullish again.
*   So, to make it real short and sweet, we're going to drop down to the hourly.

## Daily Volume Imbalance and Fair Value Gap on Hourly Chart
*   Here's the hourly even the S&P.
*   Here's our daily volume imbalance.
*   We have a **fair value gap** right there.
    *   We have institutional order Financial gel right there going down just a little bit into the Gap.
    *   Then rallying up to our levels that I shared on Twitter this morning.
*   We have a **gap opening** here.
    *   It's a new week gap opening that we'll look at that in lower time frames.
*   Also, notice how we found some support right at the top of that old daily volume imbalance. Pretty cool, isn't it?
*   This is exactly what you would expect to see from support and resistance, but it just simply never works that good when you try to draw highs and lows and diagonal support and resistance that doesn't exist.
*   I know some of you get mad when I say that, but the algorithm has no respect for that kind of thing.
*   But let's drop into, let's actually go back a little bit, I want to show you where I anchored these levels.

### Anchoring Key Levels

*   This area right here is where I have:
    *   The high of **39.69 and a quarter**
    *   The low of **39.59 and a half.**
*   This candle's high, you're looking at that value right there, that candle is high **30 and 15 and a half**.
*   This candle is low **39.69 in the quarter**, which is this level here.
*   Watch that candle low **39 69 and a quarter** and that's what you see those levels here.

### Fair Value Gap Analysis
*   What's happened was the market trades down, comes back up, trades down, one single pass, comes up, stops there, goes lower.
*   So it left an inefficiency here.
*   That's a **fair value gap**.
*   What kind of fair value gap is that? **A sell-side imbalance, buy-side inefficiency (SIBI)**.
*   It's going to want to see a move back up into it, and we see that actually occur today.
*   Beautiful, look at the bodies of the candles respecting the high of that fair value Gap. Isn't that beautiful?
*   Like that to me never grows old.
*   It's such a beautiful sight to see, and when you see something perform as you would expect it to and it's been codified the same way for years, it just keeps going over and over and over again.
*   The same logic is always unfolding, and you keep worrying about whether it's going to fail or stop working.
*   Keep trading until it stops working. Let's do it that way.
*   For all of you who have this concern that you know what I'm teaching is going to make the markets change or stop working or stop following, just keep trading it until it no longer works. Okay? Just do that and you'll be fine.

## Potential Downside Risk and Liquidity Pools
*   One of the things I'm concerned about is if we came up here, and it may be a little too early to tell, I don't know, but if we lose this fair value Gap.
*   That's the next one down here between this low and this high, equilibrium. Let me show you what I'm referring to now.

### Equilibrium and Discount Analysis

*   So below equilibrium for a discount, we have this here.
*   If we get below this, man, look at all the liquidity below that low, this low, this low.
*   There's a ton of money just sitting right there at **38.18** into **30** even, like an enormous amount of liquidity down there.
*   I'm watching this here with the expectation that if this gives way and it goes down below, maybe comes back up, acts as resistance, it doesn't need to do that.
*   But if it did something like that, then I would be looking for a nice rundown here.
*   I'm studying it, watching, see what we get from here.

### Lower Timeframe Fair Value Gap
*   But let's flush this out a little bit more. We have a little bit of a fair value Gap in here and we tear it down to that, you'll see that when we drop down to 15 minute time frame, which we're going to do right now.

## 15-Minute Chart and Twitter Alerts
*   This is the level and levels that I showed you today in Twitter.
*   If you're not a subscriber to my Twitter feed, I know some of you are like, "Oh, I'm not gonna go on Twitter. I'm not gonna do it."
*   Well, you're not going to be informed.
    *   That's what I use to alert everyone.
    *   It's a nice function for folks that don't follow me with English.
    *   If you're outside of the country, we're outside my native tongue in English, that is easily fixed by using Twitter because you can click the translate thing.
    *   I want each one of my tweets and it'll translate it for you.
*   It's also real time, just like me giving you a text message right from my phone to your phone.
*   I'm going to be worrying you all day long during a New York session.
    *   In the morning hours between roughly **8:30** and **10:00**.
    *   I'll probably warn you to death you know with lots of you know alerts and such.
*   If you want to learn how to do it and you want to have a minute by minute until we start on the February 7th live streams and this is the way I'm gonna do it.
*   If I'm tweeting too much or I'm too busy, just turn your notifications off and look at it after effect.
*   I block people that complain because I'm giving you my time for free.
*   If you're going to give me your criticisms and that you don't appreciate being you know alerted that many times you know, then unsubscribe and go follow someone else.
*   I really don't, I don't mind sending you on your way if you're gonna be disrespectful.

### Hourly Fair Value Gap and Daily Volume Imbalance Recap
*   The low and the high when the hourly city that fair value got here it is here and here.
*   Here we have that hourly fair value Gap and the top of that daily volume imbalance that right here this orange shaded area.
*   That's what we were looking for as an upside objective last week, and it got to it and then we found some support there.
*   Then the market rallies trades up into the low end objective.
*   I was not a participant to the 59 level. I rounded it down to 59 during the tweets.
*   You'll see that and even on my chart it's set to **39.59** zero zero level because I was roughly doing it with my eye.
*   This is actually the measurement between the high and the low of that fair value gap on the hourly chart.
*   The mid-range but that is consequent encouragement and it's **39.59** and three quarters.
*   So that way you know that's the actual level once it gets to the top of the hourly Fair Day Gap at noon time lunch has a market reversal little Gap in here trades up into that beautifully sells off.

### Current Market Analysis and Outlook
*   Here we have a SIBI, so I can trace right back up into the SIBI leave some of it open which is what you would like to see if it's going to be heavy and weak the market trades lower into the daily volume imbalance down into our new week gap opening I mentioned this little premature and I'll tell you a reason why I did that later on and turn it down into this imbalance and finally while we're doing our discussion here it's trading down into that.
*   Just a beautiful breakdown crazy meltdown on s p to me.
*   I think this is noteworthy.
*   I think we've probably most likely and I'm prepared to be wrong, but we most likely put the high of the week in probably already.
*   It'll be interesting to see how we trade now going forward.
*   That's my opinion.
*   Don't you bet the farm on it, but that's what I'm thinking we've seen so far.
*   Let's go down to the morning of 15 minutes run let's go to a five minute.

## 5-Minute Chart Analysis and Key Events
*   Now we're going to get a little bit more busier on the chart.
*   Some of these things are going to be a little clustered up and I apologize, but there's been a lot of things that was being discussed today.
*   We have sell side below these relative equal lows here the market drops down.
*   This candle here is **8:05**.
*   There really wasn't any news driver today, so you have to wait until **9:30** opening.
*   I tweeted that said let's just relax and let things pan out like they would.
*   I drew your attention to a breaker on the one minute chart and five minute chart.
*   The range on the five minute candle right here at the **7:35** candle, that's what I wanted you to draw out in time extending that out.
*   It was a little bit choppy, took out the cell side here and took out the buy side here.
*   Traded down to the order block, and I mentioned this also on Twitter so that way you can see that one here.
*   We were consolidating around inside the breaker, which is exactly where I told you to take your rectangle, the five minute chart and extended out in time.
*   Then we went down Wicked through at **9:30** open, took out the sell side here straight into an order block right there.

### US500 and Error Announcement
*   Now I did not mention this much because it was all happening real fast, and I got disoriented because I was trying to do the folks a favor that cannot trade ES and have to use the US-500.
*   I toggled, I was toggling back and forth with my charts you know looking at one chart with the US 500 and looking at the chart for ES which is the market actually trade.
*   I got disoriented in back and forth looking at it because like what so I I said okay note the new week opening cap down here when we went down here like this I said okay note that.
*   That was an error on my part because you can see it in my uh tweets where I mentioned right when they're going down like this and coming back off of it I'm highlighting this because I thought I saw something in the US 500 but was referring to it as if it were this chart here ES for S P 500 futures.
*   The prices are going to be slightly different if you're comparing ES and the US 500 chart.
*   Now look at the US 500 chart before I close this one out, but the Market reversed in here, and I said okay we're back inside the breaker.
*   I said return your attention back to **39.50** up here when we were in here and go back and look at the tweeze and you'll see that's the case.
*   It rallies up and then we took out this short-term high, and I said okay when you get to your fair value Gap which you will see right in here when we drop into it one minute chart let's go right into that because this is already getting long-winded.

## One-Minute Chart and Further Analysis

*   It's okay ICT, we like the long ones.
*   Other folks you're making videos too long you could have done this in five minutes you could have done this video in 30 seconds ICT.
*   I'd love to see you do it do it all live mark it up like this and then come back and explain it in 30 seconds where it makes sense or it's useful not just and this is what it did all right so

### Detailed Breakdown of One-Minute Chart

*   This is your one minute chart.
*   We had sell side below here, went down through it, came back above, came back down to the order block here on the I believe that was the eight o'clock candle let's see yeah eight o'clock handle.
*   We found some support there watching consolidating and I mentioned on Twitter that we would likely rally higher and reach up into this short-term High here.
*   Then we got 12 handles of around 10 to 12 handles that's okay.
*   You would say right now this is a partial you would Mark that as a screenshot that we can see what it looks like.
*   From here to here that's a bread and butter setup then we came back down and this is the range I told you the drag out crossover your one in five minute charts that's your bullish breaker.
*   This Market Wicks down at **9:30** open takes out the sell side here then comes back inside the breaker so I switched gears and tweeted so take your attention back **39.50** and then it rallies up and then right in here I mentioned that this candle right there you'll see that tweet at **9:45's** candle you'll see a Fair idea and it just was engaged here and look for it to Rally up to **39.50**.
*   It rallies up and we have a small little Gap here.
*   I don't believe I mentioned anything about that at the time we were at this watching price then it rallies up and I mentioned okay if we go through 350 50 have **39.59** noted on your chart which is half of the hourly imbalance.
*   Here's the high of it here's the low.
*   I know some of you that are brand new this is like flying right over your head but I promise if you keep showing up every day it will start to make sense like anything else it takes time repetition builds understanding and even if it's boring or if it feels like it's complicated right now I promise you it gets easier it just looks very very busy especially when you start seeing me annotate it live in February so you'll see me doing this stuff live not just in a static chart but I'm doing this that way I'm not Rusty I don't want to spend you know two and a half months not looking at price and start doing live streams.
*   I want to be right in there getting close to the marketplace and that's why I'm doing what I'm doing plus I'm engaging you to look in your own charts.

### Trade Execution and Proofs

*   Anyway the fair value Gap we trade down into it here rallies up cleans up the relative equal highs I took a partial oh I forgot assuming you like to see these proofs.
*   Look over here you see any arrows popping up no.
*   We're gonna take it over here and there they are here's the arrows.
*   See them so inside this here there you go I'm buying these candles actually right above the **39 50 50** level after.
*   Notice this go look at the Times okay this time here is **9:59**.
*   I am posting tweets talking about how this would be a partial when it went here.
*   I have to wait before I do my exit because I don't want to be accused of pumping and dumping okay I'm not running anything like that here so if I tweet something I have to do whatever I said after I tweet it not I'm going to get


Okay, here is the organized and detailed version of the provided text. I have maintained all the original information, tone, and narrative style while enhancing clarity and readability through structure and formatting.

### Continuation of Index Futures Review - January 9, 2023

*   Out of the marketplace, and then I'll tell you, you should get out of the marketplace. That that's unethical. I wouldn't do anything like that.
*   I'm buying it, I'm calling it before I do it, then I'm engaging it.
    *   My entries are going to be slightly off.
    *   They're going to be a little bit early sometimes, a little bit later than my ideal because I'm giving you a tweet in advance about what I'm expecting.
    *   It's always going to be after I tweet, so it's not something I'm trying to prepare a big move because all of you are following me and your belief is you're going to push the market.
*   I think that's nonsense. Okay, it's nonsense.
    *   The market doesn't work like that.
    *   You're not gonna, I'm not gonna push the S&P market around, you know, 20, 30 handles with people following me on Twitter.
    *   That's not gonna happen.
*   See, combat the people that's going to be saying this because there's no doubt going to happen um because they say all kinds of things about me, terrible things aren't even true.
*   You're seeing now that there's truth behind everything I'm saying about the algorithm, the fact that I know it like the back of my hand and it repeats.
    *   You can learn it.
    *   It's a transferable language.

## Trade Management and Market Dynamics
*   So it runs up and it allows me to get out here above the relative equal highs, and you can see that here at **39 56 and a half**, so one full handle above this level here.
*   I put a stop loss in right below the high end of that fair value gap because I didn't want to be babysitting it on my phone, I couldn't keep track of it because I was gonna be away from the screens.
*   I just put the stop loss here, told everybody.
*   I said it's either going to hit my limit which I had sitting at **39.59** even or stop me out and it stopped me out and then right at my stop, which I made public, isn't that interesting?
*   The market rallies all the way up to the high end at uh **39 69 and a quarter** and just a little bit above it.
*   Relative equal Highs are formed, then it breaks down shift in Market structure breaks lower fair value gap.
*   Shift in Mark structure rallies up sells off half the imbalance from here to here that's consequent encroachment.
*   It's accumulating short positions failure to get there that's a sell right there that candle right there that's a cell and it just keeps on melting consolidation going into the latter portions of the late afternoon and then Bang just a beautiful meltdown.

## Market Maker Sell Model
*   All of this here is a market maker sell model.
    *   We have a consolidation.
    *   What's below the consolidation? Sell-side liquidity.
    *   We rally up buying inside of a breaker.
*   You all think it's just you gotta wait for it to come back up and then buy it right there.
    *   That's the infantile approach to doing it.
    *   If you know directional bias, you know the next draw on liquidity which was going to be this level up here which I shared a tweet and saying this is where we would be.
    *   We have a fair value Gap inside of a larger five-minute breaker.
    *   It's obvious it wants to go higher.
    *   You want to accumulate like smart money builds and buy it while it's inside the breaker.
    *   When it expands you know you're on site.
    *   You don't need to wait for the breakout like retail.
*   I don't, I do not trade like that.
*   I know where it's going to break out before it's going to break out, and then I can trade inside that consolidation right in here and keying up on what.
*   You can see that fair value gap right there.
*   You can see that little imbalance.

### Algorithmic Entry Patterns
*   From this candle's High that candle's low right in here trades down to consequent encouragement there perfect.
*   Inside of this up close candle which is what bullish breaker from low to high to lower low right inside this range here that's where that fear Bay Gap happens.
*   If you're bullish and you have that that right there folks is a unicorn.
    *   It is such a beautiful beautiful hear that that's my excitement that's what I'm pounding my hand here.
    *   I'm telling you that is one the strongest algorithmic entry patterns you can ever have especially if you have just taken out South Side liquidity at the opening price or opening oh 9 30 and you see that happening here.
    *   That's why I'm not afraid of entering here.
*   What if it comes back down here? It's not going to, it's not going to, it's just like a launching pad right here.
*   It leaves it, and then every little imbalance in here you just keep adding to it and waiting for it to go up.
*   Unfortunately, you know, I couldn't babysit it. I put a stop loss there, made it public.
*   They tagged it and then rallied on up to where I was expecting it to go, and then later on in the day it hit the objective.
*   I told you to take your attention to the new weekly open Gap here, and then the coup de gras was our imbalance down here, which is just beautifully laid itself right down inside of it.

### Market Bias
*   My bias for the rest of the week will be looking and favoring shorts unless we get through half of today's wick on the daily chart.
*   I'm bearish.

## US500 Analysis and Market Focus
*   Let's try to run out of here before I did the US 500.
*   This is the hourly chart, and this is one of the reasons why I got disoriented looking at this Market because it's easy for me to lose track of where I'm at if I'm looking at different markets all the time.
*   That's why we will not be doing 4X and bonds and crude oil and gold, and I'm not having your way mentorship, you know, on the live streams.
*   I'm literally going to be looking at one market.
*   I'll give you a markup on what I think might happen like I did this morning with the US 500 and you're just going to have to watch this yourself because I literally lost my train of thought today with this.
*   I know someone you're like, oh, that doesn't make sense you should be able to I should be able to do a lot of things.
*   I should be able to leap tall buildings and stop bullets and by holding my hand out, you know, I should be able to do a lot of stuff according to all of you, but I'm not a superhero.
*   I'm not your superhero, I'm not the world savior, I'm not the Forex Jesus.
*   I'm literally trying to do the best I can with focusing on what it is that's happening real time explaining it before it happens and then trying to stay focused so I can do it well.
*   I don't want to dilute my attention and today it happened like I I I already know if I look at anything beyond just one market it's going to be problematic for me and I don't want to be frustrated with it so we're going to do it the way I want to do it.

### US500 Chart Discrepancies
*   Looking at the us-500, you can see the prices don't line up because they're not the Futures Market, it's a cfd so it's going to be a little spotty.
*   It's going to act like you know many times like the dollar Index where it's muddy looking sometimes it won't be perfect like you would expect the Euro and the pound and the Aussie dollar those types of pairs with a little bit more liquid.
*   This is pretty much moving in concert with what the Futures Contract for ES did, but it isn't going to be identical.
*   For instance, the high end in the low end of that hourly Fair bag gap which if we scrub back here you can see the anchor points for it they're really nice, but we trade above it well beyond it on the cfd versus the Futures Contract, but we ultimately see the market trade here like this.

### US500 and Trading Recommendations
*   If we drop down the 15 minute time frame, this is what I shared today on Twitter this chart just like this all these levels family ultimately did what ran up outside the range that I was looking for for ES and then it broke down and treated down into the lower objectives.
*   I'm not going to sit here and try to convince you because you're going to see a lot of this this year, but my expectation was I wanted to see it go up into the hourly Fairbank Gap here it could have went through it like this not like this this is something that completely outside of the expectation I had for ES which is why you don't see it there.
*   The cfd on us 500 which is what we're looking at over here that's the symbol this is grossly out of line with what I had expected in the ES so the measure of precision is going to be skewed when we compare and contrast es versus this here.
*   Generally, they will move in the direction the same but the levels of precision in the entry points are going to be slightly off and that's going to already know that it's going to frustrate many of you.
*   I can see the complaints already coming in like I made this for you, okay I didn't do anything with us 500 I'm trying to do whatever I can to help those individuals that can't trade the es Futures Contract.

### Data Recommendations
*   If I were you, it would be a good investment for you just to buy the you know the live data which is extremely cheap on trading View and I do not have an affiliation with them they do not give me any Kickbacks I have no business relationship partnership nothing with anybody not a broker not a funded account nothing I have no business association with anybody.
*   I'm telling you it's worth your while to invest and get live data for ES and NQ Futures markets that way you can spend this year with me learn how to do this and just simply take that information and apply it to this if you can't trade the es if you're outside the states and you want to use your mt4 Brokers or whatever all of the things I'm going to teach you work just the levels aren't going to be exactly the same that way it'll save you the insanity and being frustrated and why it doesn't line up because I'm I'm not going to be spending you know every other day answering well my chart looks different to your.
*   We should already be past all that you know your chart if you're looking at es is 10 minutes late or behind because I'm looking at real-time data so you're going to have to Avail yourself a certain resource which in my mind is cheap you're not paying me you just have to pay for the data and if you had a broker and you're trading yes you're paying for the data there too.
*   There's no escaping it you got to do it somewhere but I know some of you are spoiled with Forex because you can just pull up a chart and it shows it real time and it's free problem is sometimes Forex isn't going to be a market to be playing in and that's why you know I'm trying to broaden your horizons and I'm returning back to my roots with trading futures.

## Student Success Story
*   Last bit of business and I'm going to close this one up all right so this young man here is uh one of my students this is I'm not paying him and he doesn't uh get anything from me except for the fact that I'm giving him a nod publicly.
*   I have a lot of funded students all around the world different walks of life and I have a lot of privately funded with their own money students that are doing exceptionally well.
*   A lot of folks that are under my tutelage don't like to have the attention drawn on them because I'm very polarizing and they know that people don't like me are most likely going to you know spread the hate and vitriol towards them as well and that's unfortunate but it comes with the territory.
*   This industry is extremely Cut Throat it's extremely complex in the competition sometimes likes to play dirty and they think that they can talk about you or your your family and try to fill the internet with full of lies and things and then you have to either ignore it or just do you like I'm doing me and I'm proving I can do this stuff and it's going to be the moniker I say all the time every week every day and it won't stop.
*   This young man here looked past all of that stuff that's always followed me along over the time I've been on the internet since well he wasn't alive during the 90s when I was in America Online clearly he's a young man but he uh took it upon himself to get in there and learn how to do it looked at the mentorship lessons endured all the adversities and didn't listen to everybody else saying you can't do this or this is fake or this is that this one's a scammer he still delivers pizza yeah all that kind of stuff.
*   This young man was able to take out by his own efforts I did not coach him into buying and selling any specific thing he just did it all by himself and was able to withdraw over a quarter million dollars through several prop firms so openly and publicly this is the highest earner through funded account trading of all my students that at least have made themselves noon to me.
*   I have a lot of folks out there who's made big money someone were six figures eighty thousand fifty thousand sixty thousand you know they have done those things and you can see their withdrawals you can see their certificates and some of them are being interviewed from the actual companies uh this young man was interviewed recently by the funded Trader and I have no affiliation with any of these companies so I'm not saying you should go to any one of them that's why I don't talk about it specifically but this young man has shown himself to be able to do it and let's be honest folks a quarter of a million dollars is a quarter million dollars and I'm very proud of him I'm proud of his efforts I'm proud that he stuck with it and looked past all of the the things that people say about me or my Concepts or just make up all kinds of lies and things because they don't want you to succeed that's just the bottom line okay and they know if you listen to me and follow along and you'll learn how to do this you will never fall victim to their black box stuff their retail rehashed things that are just simply nonsense okay a quarter of a million dollars folks that's not demo okay that's not Market replay this is a young man that has taken out real money.

### Congratulating the Student
*   The companies are you know diverse they're not just one company so you can follow this young man here on Twitter and I think he has a ever-growing social media platform that he's trying to build up I'm not certain if he does anything on YouTube or not but I know I see he does I don't do Instagram but uh here's his Instagram but this is his handle on Twitter so if you want to follow them and he's trying to make a an attempt to grow self but if he's doing things like this consistently and doesn't get excited and lose his mind about it I think he's going to be somebody to watch in the future and it's been my pleasure and honor to have a very small part in guiding this young man and like I said there's a lot of these types of folks in my fold they just simply don't want to come out there this is not to ask all of you to come out there okay I'm not trying to do this you know for everybody because if you're able to do this you will be seeing people take recognition of you and they'll see it okay and there's nobody can talk this down there's no way anyone can look at this young man and what he's been able to do and you're probably looking at this like you know what you know what's the deal but he has done several things with funded accounts and things and I don't I personally I don't understand it all because I've never done a funded account I've never done any of those types of things but uh yeah this is the tweet I was looking for.

## Forex Analysis: Dollar Index and Euro Dollar - September 11, 2023

### Introduction

Alright folks, welcome back! This is a short Forex analysis video focusing on the **Dollar Index** and **Euro Dollar**. I shared some charts and levels on Twitter, so I encourage you to follow along there for context.

*   **Video URL:** <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxdjcXec3eA>

### Dollar Index Analysis

#### Daily Chart

Looking at the **daily chart** of the **Dollar Index**, we can see a trade down into a **sell-side liquidity pool**, specifically a **fair value gap** (FVG) also referred to as a **buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency (BISI)**. That's where our levels are, everything will be linked to this logic.

#### Hourly Chart (September 9, 2023)

*   **Opening Price:** Observe the opening price on the candle for September 9th, 2023.
*   **Sell-Side Liquidity Pool:** Note the relatively equal lows representing the **sell-side liquidity pool**.
*   **Market Movement:** The market opens, rallies up, and then sells off down into our **fair value gap** identified on the daily chart.

#### 15-Minute Timeframe

*   **Buy-Side and Sell-Side Liquidity:** Observe the **buy-side** and **sell-side liquidity** present during the London session.
*   **Midnight Opening Candle:** The opening candle at midnight and its opening price is critical.
*   **Bearish Outlook:** With a bearish outlook, we anticipate lower prices, indicating a risk-on scenario for the dollar. A dollar rally would target **buy-side liquidity** or trade into an inefficiency like a **sell-side imbalance buy-side inefficiency (SIBI)** or FVG.
*   **Market Action**: The market trades above, takes out buy-side liquidity and attacks sell-side liquidity.

#### 5-Minute Timeframe

*   **New York Open Kill Zone:** Between 7:00 AM and 9:00 AM New York local time, we observed a drop.
*   **SIBI:** A notable **SIBI (Sell-side Imbalance Buy-side Inefficiency)** is present.
*   **Daily Lows as Resistance:** The old relatively equal lows from the daily chart serve as a reference point. The retracement doesn't reach back up to the old daily lows or equal lows, highlighting a failure of traditional support and resistance. However, a trade up into consequent encroachment, the midpoint of that fair value gap and then fails to make a return to old daily lows and old equal lows where the algorithm is expected to kick in.
*   **Algorithm Activity:** Expect the algorithm to activate around these levels.
*   **Session Close:** The index sells off, trading into the daily FVG and closes the session at the low of the day.
*   **Noon London Close Kill Zone:** Exactly at noon.
*   **Model Reference:** This movement aligns with the model from the 2022 internship program available on this YouTube channel.

#### Model Implementation: Short Trade

*   **Short Setup:** Short the Dollar Index.
*   **Stop Loss:** Place the stop loss above the recent high.
*   **Target:** Target the equal lows representing the daily **sell-side liquidity pool** and the **fair value gap** below.
*   **Turning Point:** The market turns again at noon, consistent with the core content teachings on this channel.

### Euro Dollar Analysis

#### Daily Chart

These levels were given on Twitter so make sure to follow there!

*   **Buy-Side Liquidity:** Observe the **buy-side liquidity** at an old high in the past.
*   **Fair Value Gap:** There is a **fair value gap (FVG)**. The market traded up into it, consolidated intraday, and then rallied up into our buy-side liquidity pool.

#### Hourly Chart

*   **Order Block:** Note the order block from the 8th. The market drops down into that rallies away.
*   **Down Closed Candle:** Prior to the consolidation, the opening price of the down-closed candle is extended. The market respects this level.

#### 15-Minute Timeframe

*   **Sell-Side Liquidity Pool:** The Euro Dollar has a **sell-side liquidity pool** that he prefers as eye jumps right to those levels where candles get real close to being equal.

#### 5-Minute Timeframe

*   **London Open Kill Zone:** Between 2:00 AM and 5:00 AM New York local time. The Market drops down in London open, rallies back up, takes out buy-side expands small little retracement and rallies up creating the high up here.
*   **New York Open Kill Zone:** The 7:00 AM New York local time marks the beginning of the New York open kill zone. This is where the setup is expected to form.
*   **Expected Daily Range:** The daily range high or low should be forming if it's going to be a trending day. If bullish, the opposite end of the range is generally created between 10:00 AM and noon New York local time.
*   **London Low:** The low of the day formed in the London open kill zone, consistent with teachings on this channel.
*   **Alignment Balance:** If bearish on the dollar, we are bullish on the Euro Dollar. We observe a small alignment balance, with trades down into a bullish order block. The market rallies, retraces back down into the order block, and then ramps up through buy-side liquidity.
*   **Fibonacci Standard Deviation:** If you take your Fibonacci anchor it to this low up to this high and use a 1.5 standard deviation.

#### Fibonacci Projections and Time Windows

*   **Kill Zone:** The Kill Zone time window needs to be meet.
*   **FIB Settings:** Set up a 1.5 standard deviation on your FIB settings. When you drop this on this price one here, you'll get exactly the closing prices.
*   **Standard Projections:** Run through that, we can start doing standard projections on our Fibonacci which is going to be standard deviation one 1.5 to 2.5 3 3.5 and so on until it would meet a Time window like The Kill Zone.

#### Homework Assignment

Your homework assignment is to get to that closing price rate here in the opening price with your fit between this low and that high measuring that and your projections will take you right up into that right there. Study how the low of the day formed in the London open kill zone. Continuation in New York open Kill Zone and then the high of the day is forming in London close.

### Closing Remarks

That's it for today! I will be back later in the week. The Forex content will be a slow rollout until February 7th, when daily content will resume.

Until next time, be safe!

# Comprehensive Review and Analysis of a Trading Execution

This document provides a detailed breakdown of a trading execution, complete with the trader's thought process, strategies, and observations. All details are meticulously preserved to provide a comprehensive understanding.

## Introduction

This is a review of a trading execution, typically sped up and condensed into a shorter format for social media platforms like Twitter. The following analysis will walk through the entire process in real time, highlighting key decisions and rationale.

## Pre-Trade Analysis and Preparation

### **Key Level Identification:**

*   **4030:** This level was identified as a key target both in the weekend commentary and in a morning tweet.
*   Following on **Twitter:** To get real-time alerts and level watches, follow the official ICT Twitter account which can be found on the main page of the YouTube channel in the far right corner.

### **Initial Setup:**

*   **Long Entry:** Initiated inside a fair value gap as price approached the middle part of the shaded area.
*   **Limit Order:** Placed at 4030, representing a best-case scenario exit.

### **Rationale for 4030 Level:**

*   Daily Chart (ESH2023): The 4030 level corresponds to the closing price on December 14, 2022.
*   **Key Elements:** Open, high, low, and close, combined with time elements and specific algorithmic macros.

## Identifying Key Market Structures and Order Blocks

### **Twitter Alert:**

*   **9:43 Candle:** A large bullish green candle was highlighted on Twitter.
*   **Down-Close Candle Entry:** Identified as an order block.

### **Volume Imbalance Assessment:**

*   Potential volume imbalance forming due to the absence of overlapping bodies between two candles.
*   Monitoring the gap between the current candle's open and the previous candle's close for potential additional long entries.

### **Target Profit and Strategy:**

*   Aiming for $10,000 profit from a single trade, built up through pyramiding entries.

## Market Context and Liquidity Analysis

### **Sell-Side Liquidity:**

*   Sell-side stops located below the 9:20 low.
*   Liquidity was purged with a drop down at approximately 9:40.
*   **4030:** Market objective that was communicated before the market started.

### **Waiting for Optimal Conditions:**

*   Sidelines early, waiting for the right setup.
*   Prompted Twitter followers to wait for the 9:30 opening.
*   Observed sell-side liquidity being taken out, followed by a market rally.

## Trade Execution: Fair Value Gaps & Stop Loss Placement

### **Fair Value Gap Rationale:**

*   Utilizing an advanced model expecting expansion.
*   Focus on expansion into the 4030 level, rather than a trending day.
*   **4030 Significance:** Closes in the range from the December 14th closing price on the daily chart for ESH2023.

### **Stop Loss Placement:**

*   Stop loss placed below the mean threshold (middle) of the down-closed candle closest to the 9:40 candle.
*   Rationale: Expectation that price should not return below this level after sell-side stops were taken at the 9:20 low.
*   Time Setting: New York local time is critical for tracking.

## Risk Management & Scaling Strategy

### **Initial Position and Risk:**

*   Currently holding eight contracts long.
*   Stop loss is set based on a $100,000 account.
*   Risk Target: 1.2% of the account.

### **Monitoring Price Action:**

*   Focus on price movements in increments of five handles to train the eye.
*   Revisiting the volume imbalance area.
    *   Five Handles Example: Equivalent to a move from 4025 to 4020, or 20 ticks.
    *   One Mini Contract (ES): Equivalent to $250 profit or loss per five-handle move ($50 per handle).

### **Anticipating Price Movement:**

*   Waiting for the market to show speed and distance through the existing high.
*   Anticipating a reaction at the volume imbalance area.

## Deep Dive into Candle Analysis & Market Efficiency Paradigm

### **Volume Imbalance Revisited:**

*   Volume imbalance defined as an area without overlap between candle bodies.
*   Analyzing the wicks and candle formations for entry points.
    *   Example: An up-close candle with a wick, where the next candle opens higher than the previous candle's close.

### **Entry Timing:**

*   Timing entries as candles are moving down, specifically targeting the wick midpoint.
*   Aiming to buy as the candle moves toward the volume imbalance.
*   Paradigm in Action: Entering long on down-closed (down) candles and taking profits on up candles.

## Stop Adjustment and Potential Pyramiding

### **Risk Adjustment:**

*   Risk elevated to 1.3%, still considered minimal.
*   Considering raising the stop further.
*   Potential for another pyramiding entry if an opportunity arises.

### **Monitoring Key Levels:**

*   Focusing on the high formed around 9:30.
*   Observing the speed with which the market can move through the 4023.5 level (morning session high).

### **Confidence Assessment:**

*   Initial entry was on inside the fair value gap.
*   Confident that the high of fair value gap is likely to be revisited as the market expands.

## Analyzing the Current Trading Range

### **Dealing Range Identification:**

*   Price is operating within a dealing range between the 9:43 candle and the 9:30 high.
*   Waiting for an aggressive move through this high, not just a minor poke.
*   Potential retest of the volume imbalance if movement lacks energy.

### **Bullish Order Block:**

*   Down-closed candle to the left of the second partial entry identified as a bullish order block.
*   Considering another partial entry within this range to build the position.

## Refining Exit Strategy and Target Reassessment

### **Profit-Taking Considerations:**

*   Planning to take off six (half) of the position if the market runs to 4030.
*   Any retracements lower will not focus on the fair value gap two candles back to the left.
*   Down closed candle that traded into the volume imbalance is more interesting as a potential area to accumulate more long positions.

### **Trust in Objectives:**

*   Trusting that the unrealized objective at 4030 (discussed pre-market) remains viable.

## Identifying a Key Bullish Order Block for Re-Entry

### **Order Block Identification:**

*   Specifically focusing on the down-close candle, identifying it as a bullish order block.

### **Entry Strategy:**

*   Looking to participate on the upside move from within that candle.
*   Long Entry: Initiated as price entered the midpoint (mean threshold) of the down-closed candle.
*   Trusting the Volume Imbalance: Expectation that price should not go below the volume imbalance.

### **Futures vs. Forex:**

*   Rationale Comparison: Contrast this thinking with Forex, where such precise stop losses are often targeted.
*   Forex Warning: Forex is prone to cannibalizing strategies of precision, especially with size.
*   Futures Advantage: Futures is characterized as a cleaner and more professionally managed asset class.

## Confirming Momentum and Spotting Acceleration Signals

### **Price Action Observation:**

*   Price retested the order block successfully,
*   The stop loss remains at the low of the candle prior to the run above the 9:30 high.
*   Stop Loss Status: Currently showing a negative value of $225.

### **Bullish Order Block in Action:**

*   Inside the bullish order block, expecting accumulation of smart money longs.
*   Algorithm Anticipation: Expecting the algorithm to reprice higher after a period of time.

### **Trigger Point Identification:**

*   Algorithm Needs: Stating that the market needs to make a new high and go above the 9:30 high, and higher high that it formed just a few candles back.
*   **The Level:** Small city or trigger level needs to be breached to initiate aggressive algorithmic price spooling.
*   Signature Identification: A unique signature that indicates when the algorithm will start firing aggressively.
*   Post-Breach Expectation: Once that candle's high is taken out, price should accelerate and not trade below the lowest open or close of the swing low.

### **Acceleration Trigger:**

*   Once that level "needs to rip through" is breached, the algorithm will aggressively reprice higher.
*   No matter the number of buyers or sellers, the algorithm will target the buy-side liquidity above the high formed around 9:53 or 9:54.

## Final Acceleration and Profit-Taking Strategy

### **Acceleration Confirmation:**

*   Acceleration occurs, described as "like gas on a fire."
*   **Focus Shifts:** To the 4030 level.
*   **Contract Management:** Reducing position size from 14 contracts, taking nine off due to not seeing continuation on the outside.
*   Monitoring how price stays above the highs formed at 9:30 and 9:53.

### **Profitability:**

*   Five Handle Movements: Multiple five-handle movements in the anticipated direction toward 4030.
*   Accumulation: Each movement potentially accumulating to 15 handles for the day.
*   Mitigation Block: Should accumulate new longs and accelerate through.

### **Execution Confirmation:**

*   Execution triggered to take nine contracts off as soon as price prints above 4030.
*   Price Behavior: A macro in price typically takes place between 9:50 and 10:10.

## Conclusion and Final Thoughts

### **Outcome:**

*   Outcome: $10,400 in profit from one trade, risking no more than 1.3% of the account.
*   Attributes: Characterized as highly precise, based on specific ideas, with aggressive and superior stop-loss management.
*   Reflection: Deemed insightful with aggressive strategy.

# **Analysis of Market Conditions and Trading Strategy**

## **I. Initial Market Assessment (January 17th/18th)**

*   **Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWekmMLqiNM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWekmMLqiNM)
*   **Date/Time:** Wednesday, January 18th, 8:50 PM Eastern Standard Time
*   The presenter will play a portion of a previous night's Twitter space session. The analysis provided in that session will be compared to the chart at the time of recording (January 18th).
*   **Context:** The presenter resides in Maryland, which aligns with New York local time. The Twitter space session on the previous night, January 17th, started around 7:20 PM Eastern Time and lasted approximately two hours.

### A. **Key Levels and Fair Value Gaps**

*   Looking at the daily chart:
    *   **January 11th (Wednesday):** A large "up candle" is observed.
    *   **January 12th (Thursday):** The candle to the right of the January 11th candle has a lower low.
    *   **January 10th:** The candle preceding January 11th has a higher high.
    *   The above forms a small **fair value gap**, creating a potential area of interest if the market drops down.
    *   The **midpoint of the wick** on the January 9th candle is also significant. It aligns approximately with the high of the January 10th candle. This midpoint represents the halfway point between the high and the open price of the January 9th candle.
*   Preference is given to the market trading down into half of the wick on January 13th (Friday the 13th).
    *   **Fibonacci Setup:**
        *   Take your Fibonacci tool.
        *   Anchor it to the **low of the January 13th daily candle**.
        *   Drag it **up to the opening of that same candle**.
        *   The resulting Fibonacci level should be approximately **3982.50**. This is considered a significant level to monitor for that evening and the following day.

### B. **Analysis of Fair Value Gaps & Market Direction**

*   The presenter is willing to favor the market trading down. This drop would be considered a considerable one.
*   The location between the high and open price of January 9th is the high of January 10th.

### C. **Purpose of Content Creation**

*   The presenter enjoys creating annotated videos. While they could create videos without annotations for personal entertainment, the annotations are included to benefit the audience.
*   The annotations allow viewers to:
    *   Examine the highlighted areas on their own charts.
    *   Analyze these areas on smaller or larger timeframes.
    *   Assess the significance of these levels based on the presenter's teachings.

## **II. Mentorship and Market Commentary Philosophy**

### A. **Addressing Support and Criticism**

*   The presenter acknowledges the support received from students across various platforms (YouTube, Twitter, Facebook). He is honored to be their mentor.
*   The presenter also acknowledges criticism, which he says does not bother him.

### B. **Distinguishing Features: The "Enigma" Algorithm**

*   The presenter emphasizes a unique aspect of his approach:
    *   "No one has my **Enigma algorithm**. No one has cracked it. No one will. And I will not teach it to anyone."
*   The claim is that only the presenter can consistently outline the market with the accuracy demonstrated.

### C. **Content Delivery and Distribution**

*   The Twitter space sessions are not hosted anywhere else officially.
*   Some students record and upload these sessions to their own YouTube channels, which the presenter is okay with.
*   Many people listened to the January 17th presentation before Wednesday's trading even began.

### D. **Comment Section Policy**

*   The presenter has disabled the comment sections on videos due to excessive "sugar Fest" comments.
*   While appreciative of the encouragement, the presenter believes these comments are not helpful to the general public and create an appearance of seeking worship or praise.
*   Comments are still visible to the presenter privately.
*   The comment section is being opened specifically for *this* video.
    *   The presenter requests viewers who listened to the Twitter space presentation *before* Wednesday's trading to leave a comment indicating their experience.
    *   He is looking for substantial comments, not short, generic ones (to avoid fake comments bought by competitors).
    *   The presenter specifically *does not* want comments that excessively praise or glorify him.

## **III. Trading Methodology and Market Insight**

### A. **Transparency and Limitations**

*   The presenter admits that, before going to sleep, he often *doesn't* have a clear-cut scenario for the morning session.
*   He usually checks the midnight into London session upon waking, as he no longer trades the London session live.
*   He emphasizes that there are times when he *doesn't* have a clear directional bias or a specific setup to trade. In such cases, he admits to waiting for more information.

### B. **Critique of Common Analysis Techniques**

*   The presenter criticizes the majority of Twitter analysts/traders who provide "squiggly lines" indicating multiple possible outcomes (if price goes up, then this; if price goes down, then that).
*   He acknowledges that even his own analysis sometimes requires more information to determine the next setup.
*   If a clear narrative or setup is not apparent in the chart while he is talking to his audience, he does not provide a specific recommendation.

### C. **Role of Twitter and Real-Time Market Interaction**

*   His Twitter account is designed for real-time interaction during market hours.
*   He typically posts during the morning and afternoon sessions.
*   Tweets may include:
    *   Specific price levels of interest.
    *   Charts highlighting key areas.
    *   References to patterns or entry techniques.
*   The goal is to prompt viewers to observe price action and see how the concepts he teaches materialize in real-time.
*   Viewers are encouraged to watch price action, applying his experience, analysis, and concepts to *tape reading*.

### D. **Emphasis on Tape Reading and Individualized Learning**

*   The Twitter activity is *not* a signal service; it's about applying his experience to individual charts.
*   He will not provide stop losses or entry techniques.
*   He will indicate where he believes the market will reach for.
*   The absence of signals is intentional to avoid conflicts of interest with students who operate signal services.
*   The presenter encourages viewers to:
    *   See the chart for themselves.
    *   Identify patterns that resonate with them.
    *   Develop their own unique trading model.
*   **Tape reading**, watching price action with the expectation of a seasoned analyst, is emphasized as crucial.
*   He suggests a minimum of six months, preferably a full calendar year, of this practice.
*   Live mentorship sessions with chart analysis will begin February 7th, but commentary and prompts are provided on Twitter year-round.

### E. **Twitter Content as a Supplement**

*   The presenter states that there are various things he will not be talking about in this presentation because it can be found on his Twitter account
*   Short videos and execution examples of trades going to levels that were called can be found on his Twitter account

## **IV. Specific Market Analysis and Precision**

### A. **Recap of Key Levels and Market Conditions**

*   The presenter states that he has previously talked about the very specifics that are being shown in the chart at the time of the recording.
*   The specific closing price of **4030.75** was mentioned in the presenter's weekend commentary on YouTube.
*   The presenter noted that on both Tuesdays and Wednesdays the market had a hard time moving passed that level.
*   At 7:00 PM the previous night, the presenter felt that there was no confidence to side on one narrative or bias because of the long wicks in the chart.
*   If the presenter does not have an opinion on London or AM stock sessions, then he has to come to the conclusion that he is neutral.
*   Neutral bias means that he has to wait for more information.

### B. **Level Recall**

*   The level 3982.50 was also called out in last night's Twitter space and is the middle of the wick.

### C. **Fair Value Gap and January 10th Candle Recap**

*   The fair value gap that was mentioned at the beginning of the Twitter space is back in the presentation and the candle's high on January 10th is the exact low to the tick of Wednesday's trading.

### D. **Precision Trading and Order Block**

*   The presenter states that he is known for his precision to the PIP in 4X and to the tick in Futures.
*   The presenter claims that the precision that can be demonstrated in Futures and Bond trading is something that cannot be beaten. In 30 year bonds, the precision is to the tick most times. Forex can be off two to three PIPs because of the Broker spread.
*   The presenter notes that his tight stop losses can work in Futures but not Forex because in Forex brokers can open the spread and snatch the order. This precision is possible in Futures because everyone has the same price.
*   The presenter is confident that his stops are in the right place and if his stops are hit then that means he is wrong.
*   The arrays being taught respect the orders.
*   Laser precision with stops, trade targets, and entries shows authorship and nobody but him has the Enigma Algorithm.

### E. **Final Thoughts on Information Sharing**

*   The presenter believes that the competitive side of trading is shady and people will attempt to make up things to claim that they can do the same. However they will not be able to perform the same way because they do not have the Enigma Algorithm.
*   The Enigma Algorithm allows the presenter to take parts of the market and explain how it was going to go in a particular direction. However, no one can be perfect and this candle is high.


# **Analysis of Market Conditions and Trading Strategy** (Continued)

## **V. Daily Time Frame Precision and Algorithm Transferability**

*   The presenter discusses the prior night's **Twitter space session**, emphasizing its contents were also available.
*   **Student Verification:** Students have recorded themselves listening to the Twitter space content while simultaneously analyzing their charts, posting their findings on their YouTube channels. This is presented as evidence of the immediate transferability of the shared information.
*   **Relevance Across Timeframes:** The Enigma algorithm's precision extends to all time frames, not just intraday charts.
    *   While the algorithm operates uniformly, its application requires adjustments based on the specific timeframe.
    *   Longer durations are needed for setups to materialize on daily, four-hour, and hourly charts.
*   Traders hesitant to engage intraday can leverage these setups on daily charts, allowing positions to unfold over time.

## **VI. January 10th Candle and January 18th Low - The Tick Precision**

*   Referencing the high of the January 10th candle, the presenter highlights its exact alignment with the low of Wednesday's trading, January 18th, 2023, precise "to the tick."
*   He urges viewers to verify this on their own charts.
*   **Precision Claim:** This is presented not as an approximation, but as definitive proof of the algorithm's accuracy. There is no gray area.
*   **Testimonial to Authorship:** Such precision is presented as proof of the Enigma algorithm's unique authorship.
    *   The presenter explicitly states he is the one who knows what the algorithm is, owns it, engineered it, wrote it, coded it, and is proving it.
*   The presenter provides the daily range and areas of consolidation, and alignment. Then he will indicate where the market is likely to move based on the algorithm.
*   He invites the audience to assess the accuracy of his calls through his tweets, where he claims to deliver insights daily.

## **VII. Rejection of Signal Services and Focus on Understanding**

*   His students are understanding and growing their own understanding without being spoon fed signals.
*   The presenter states he will not be helpful to those who are looking for signals, entry techniques, and stops, and to "put me in a trade."
*   The presenter stated that he respects his students running signal services and does not want to encroach on their clientele.
*   He wants to avoid the responsibility and the headache that comes with that.

## **VIII. Overnight Dynamics and Fair Value Gap Delivery**

*   He also noted that the candles' low was at 39.61 and three-quarters in multiple time frames.
*   Referencing the specific scenario from the previous night's Twitter space, the presenter explains the need to wait for the morning session (9:30 AM opening) to assess price delivery.
*   He mentions that at 7:20 PM, he did not have a clear-cut bias because he had to wait until the morning session.
*   He states that anything can happen overnight.
*   The same fair value gap being highlighted on the daily chart is present on the hourly chart. The fair value gap is classified as a PD array.
*   The fair value gap has a classification for the fair value gap, is a busy meaning buy side and balance outside and efficiency. It was delivered on the daily chart with an up candle and the algorithm is expected to deliver it to the downside with sell side.
*   The low is presented as "nailing" the fair value gap below "to the tick."

## **IX. Hourly Chart Analysis and the 4030.75 Level**

*   The presenter notes that this morning on Twitter everyone was being counseled to be mindful that it was very choppy.
*   There was a mention of the 4030.75 level for upside last week, with other potential target areas of 4020 and 4040.
*   The presenter waited to see it for himself to align with short positions, based on analysis from 7:20 the previous night.
*   The presenter needed to wait and see if the algorithm would want to run up and take out the Tuesday High and end at 4040.
*   There was no fair value gap to reach for, because the market was bumping against 4030.75 on the daily chart.
*   The upper boundary on the daily chart did not lend well to go beyond for a higher fair value gap.
*   Short-term buy stop hunts were anticipated over the 4035 high, with the potential for a drive up to 4040.

## **X. "Turtle Soup" Scenario and Traded Experiences**

*   The presenter outlined his plan to watch out for 4036 on Twitter and mentions of a potential run to 4040.
*   If a drive up to 4040 were to occur, he would look for it to fail as a "turtle soup" fake breakout, enabling short selling towards 3982.50.
*   **Trading Transparency:** The presenter mentions two long trades this morning, getting partials off until buyside sell equity before coming back on his stop.
*   The trade coming back to the stop on break even was not a big deal, but it was a demonstration of small timeframe moves for five handles.
*   The point of reaching down to 3982.5 level should not be confused because this line is anchored to the daily chart.
*   The algorithm will refer to higher time frame levels when transposing the same levels into lower time frames.

## **XI. Debunking Market Misconceptions**

*   The presenter states that the market does not drop because there are a lot of sellers coming in, and it does not drop because it ran out of buyers either.
*   The presenter states that the market is controlled by algorithms that run price.
*   **Rejecting Volume-Based Narratives:** The presenter dismisses the idea that buying and selling pressure are the primary drivers of market movements.
    *   He cites the example of overnight gaps, questioning the amount of volume required to create such significant price changes.
*   **Manipulation and Control:** The presenter asserts that the markets are controlled and manipulated.
*   **Waiting for Algorithmic Signatures:** He emphasizes the need to wait for specific signals or occurrences in price action dictated by the algorithm.
    *   These occurrences are what he is teaching for free.
*   The presenter states that he is proving those signals daily, and is showing precision entries, partial exits, and stop placements.
*   The presenter states that everything he does shows proof of authorship.

## **XII. Clarifying Intentions and Addressing Criticism**

*   The presenter notes that he is speaking from a position of authority, and not to be a braggadocio.
*   The lessons will take the audience to places that they are not ready for yet.
*   **Enigma's Uniqueness:** The presenter emphasizes that the algorithm has nothing to do with the chart and is entirely based on time, price, and macros that are not visible until after they happen.
*   **Defensiveness and Critique of Imitators:** The presenter acknowledges a segment of his audience that dislikes these types of statements, particularly those who are running telegram signal rooms while pretending to be "technical heroes."
*   These "pretend Traders" do not tell the audience what they are going to see in the marketplace, but rather gives the both sides of the coin type thing.
*   The lay audience cannot see that the pretend Trader said both sides.
*   The presenter states that 90% of the time he knows what he is talking about, proves it, walks it, shows receipts, catches it beforehand, and executes on it.

## **XIII. Real-Time Adaptability and Algorithmic Signatures**

*   The presenter states that there are times where he is waiting for more information and there is nothing wrong with that.
*   The presenter needs to see what the market wants to do, and wait for the manual intervention to take place.
*   The difference between the presenter and others, is the presenters students are actually doing what he says without telling them how to trade it.
*   Once it shows its hand to the presenter, then he can say "we are looking for this."
*   If the presenter is in a period that requires more information, he is neutral, meaning that he is waiting for the algorithm to show him what it wants to do, and then he can align with it.

## **XIV. Contrarian Approach and Risk Management**

*   The presenter loves looking for traders that have strong opinions when the algorithm is doing something else.
*   The presenter likes to see when there is a diametrically opposed position held by the retail community.
*   When this happens, he is going to go in with maximum risk, because smart money is "arm wrestling" retail money.
*   **Contingency Scenarios and Honest Assessment:** Even when personally uncertain, the presenter will provide his best assessment under hypothetical pressure.
    *   Using the analogy of a "gun to my head," he outlines his likely bias at 7:20 PM the previous night.
*   **Submitting to Market Action:** Despite having a potential lean, he would wait for the 9:30 AM opening. He wanted to see what would happen with the run up with Tuesday's high.
*   This included the possibility of spiking to the 4040 level. This would be looked at as an opportunity to sell short.
*   He would add to the shorts as it made more fair value gaps and bearish Breakers.


Here's a structured breakdown of the provided text, optimized for clarity and detail.

# **Continuation of Trading Strategy Analysis**

## **XV. Lower Time Frame Analysis: Managing Choppiness and Uncertainty**

*   **Initial Range-Bound Trading:**
    *   The presenter initially worked within a small range due to a lack of clear directional cues.
    *   He was waiting for bearish institutional order flow entry drills to consider short positions.
*   **Student Inquiry:** Some students questioned why he didn't anticipate certain breakdowns in the market earlier.
*   **Elevated Risk and Uncertainty:**
    *   The presenter emphasizes the elevated risk levels and uncertainty present in the morning.
    *   He was unwilling to commit to short positions until he had sufficient justification.

## **XVI. Utilizing Opening Prices in Algorithmic Trading**

*   **Midnight Opening Price (New York Local Time):**
    *   Ideally, when being bearish, the presenter seeks to enter short positions above the midnight opening price.
    *   This area is where smart money often accumulates the largest portion of their short positions for the daily range.
*   **Alternative Opening Prices:**
    *   The 8:30 AM and 9:30 AM opening prices can also be utilized.
    *   These three opening prices can be used uniquely and independently within a 24-hour trading period.
*   **Overnight Activity:** The largest portion of the day's moves can often form overnight in London.
*   **Consolidation Considerations:** This pattern doesn't always hold, especially during consolidations.

## **XVII. Awaiting Key Market Signals and Targeted Entries**

*   **Tuesday's High:** The presenter was waiting to see if the market would take out Tuesday's high.
    *   He aimed to "nail down the high" within half a point, which is why he was attempting to go long for small gains before reversing.
*   **Missed Opportunity:** He didn't get the anticipated run above 4036 or a spike into 4040.
*   **Waiting for Sell-Side Information:** He had to wait for more information on the sell side because the spike above Tuesday's high didn't occur.
*   **Drift Down to Key Levels:** The market drifted down to 3982.5 and 3973.
    *   These levels are derived by splitting the wicks on the low end of the daily candle in half and measuring 50%.

## **XVIII. Five-Minute Chart Analysis: Identifying Market Structure Shifts**

*   **9:30 AM Opening Bell:** The presenter waits for the 9:30 AM opening bell.
*   **Choppiness and False Breakouts:** The initial period after the open was characterized by choppiness.
*   **Short-Term Low Consideration:** A short-term low formed, but the presenter initially dismissed it.
    *   The specific low he wanted to see break down was the one that ran up to create a new higher high and took out the spike over.
*   **Algorithmic Theory: "If This, Then That"**:
    *   Algorithmic theory relies heavily on conditional logic: "If this occurs, then that."
    *   Decisions are binary and weighed based on these conditions.

## **XIX. Validating Market Structure and Trading Decisions**

*   **Delayed Breakdown Confirmation:** The presenter notes that the key short-term low wasn't taken out until a specific point later in the day.
*   **Tweeting Intentions:** The presenter refers to a tweet where he indicated he wanted to go short, but only after certain conditions were met.
*   **Avoiding Premature Entries:** He avoided taking the short-term low breakdown initially, fearing a potential spike up to 4036.
*   **Contingency Plan for a 4036 Run:**
    *   If the market had spiked above Tuesday's high (around 4036), he would have used the resulting swing low as a shift in market structure (bearish).
    *   He would then trade any fair value gap between 4036 and that low, targeting 3982.5.
*   **Transparency and Logic:** The presenter emphasizes the logic and narrative driving his decisions.

## **XX. Utilizing Twitter for Real-Time Market Analysis**

*   **Referencing Tweets:** The presenter directs the audience to his tweets for further context.
*   **Tweet Volume:** He acknowledges that his tweet frequency can be high on busy days.
*   **Notification Management:** He advises those bothered by the volume of tweets to turn off notifications.
*   **Consequences of Complaint:** He humorously notes that he will block those who complain about his tweeting.
*   **Hindsight vs. Real-Time Analysis:** While breakdowns look clear in hindsight, the logic he was waiting for required a spike higher above Tuesday's high.
*   **Key Levels and Patterns:** He points out fair value gaps and bearish order blocks on the chart.

## **XXI. One-Minute Chart: Precision and Algorithmic Signatures**

*   **Reiterating the Short-Term Low:** The presenter revisits the short-term low mentioned on the five-minute chart.
*   **Contingency Planning:** He re-emphasizes that even with a gap on the one-minute chart, he made allowances for a potential run to Tuesday's high.
*   **Prompted by Audience:** He mentions a tweet where he responded to audience prompts about a potential short entry.
*   **Fair Value Gap and South Side Liquidity:** The price broke down, creating a fair value gap ahead of tagging south side liquidity.
*   **Power Three Concept:** Two beautiful setups formed close to the midnight opening price, aligning with the Power Three concept he teaches.

## **XXII. Institutional Order Flow Entry Drills (IOFED)**

*   **IOFED Defined:**
    *   Institutional Order Flow Entry Drill (IOFED) is a high-frequency trading entry technique.
    *   Price touches the candle that creates a fair value gap or imbalance.
    *   Algorithms often use this technique, sometimes with just a one-tick move.
*   **Attribution:** The presenter claims that many firms now use this technique.
*   **SIBI Classification:** Sell-side imbalance, buy-side inefficiency (SIBI) is a fair value gap classification.
*   **Lunch Hour Activity:** Price action is shown going into the lunch hour.

## **XXIII. Detailed Analysis of One-Minute Chart Examples**

*   **Specific Trade Examples:** The presenter walks through specific instances on the one-minute chart.
    *   He points out an entry technique with a fair value gap.
    *   He describes a trade where he took partial profits after running above the buy side, only to be stopped out at breakeven.
*   **Importance of Context:** Even with a short-term low, any misinterpretations of signals could lead to getting caught offside.
*   **Waiting for Confirmation:** He reiterated that he didn't want to get caught offside, so he wanted the run up to happen and have it fake out at 4036 before going short.

## **XXIV. Trading Decisions in Real-Time**

*   **Real-Time Tweets:** As one example, the presenter describes his thoughts as a candle was trading up to a fair value gap at 10:34 New York time.
*   **Internal Verification:** He emphasizes the internal measurement and verification processes he uses, based on the logic he teaches.
*   **Tweeting Process:** He explains the time it takes to type out his analysis and post it.
*   **Candle-by-Candle Analysis:** He notes that his analysis is often based on the current one-minute candle.
*   **Trusting the Setup:** Even though the price moved through it, the presenter trusted this setup.

## **XXV. The Hallmarks of a Perfect Algorithmic Setup**

*   **Institutional Order Flow:** Because the low was taken, this candle had already ran up and hit the bottom end of these up close candles, this is the presenter’s bearish order block.
*   **Perfect Opening Price Alignment:** The presenter points out the opening price's precise alignment.
*   **Claim of Superiority:** He asserts that there's no comparison to "perfect," emphasizing ownership, authorship, and superiority.
*   **Encouragement to Learn:** He encourages the audience to learn to read price better, as the market algorithm is coded this way.
*   **Delivery to the Tick:** The price runs up to the opening price and delivers lower prices "to the tick."
*   **Immediate Repricing:** When he sees this type of signature, he expects immediate repricing lower.
*   **Continuation and Afternoon Session:** He will continue by analyzing the afternoon session and the 1:32-4:15 time window (last hour of trading).


Here's a structured breakdown of the provided text, optimized for clarity and detail.

# **Continuation of Trading Strategy Analysis**

## **XXVI. Fair Value Gaps and Market Structure Analysis**

*   **Trading within Fair Value Gaps:**
    *   Price trades up into a **fair value gap**.
    *   The market breaks down and returns to the **fair value gap**.
    *   Another smaller **fair value gap** is created.
    *   This signals a short opportunity with sell-side liquidity below.
*   **Measured Move Technique:**
    *   Expanding from a high to a low and projecting it lower can identify range lows.
    *   A low acts as a fulcrum point.
    *   The range high to range low is multiplied and projected lower to find potential range lows.
*   **Level Specificity:**
    *   The presenter emphasizes the precision of levels.
    *   He references a specific level (4943.75) as the actual tick low.
    *   "You can't improve upon that."

## **XXVII. Utilizing Opening Prices and Power Three Concept**

*   **End-of-Day Market Closure:** The market closes at 4:15 PM.
*   **After-Hours Trading:** The presenter disregards after-hours trading.
*   **Applying Opening Prices at 1:30 PM:**
    *   If bearish, the opening price at 1:30 PM can be used similarly to the midnight, 8:30 AM, and 9:30 AM opening prices.
    *   If the market rallies above the opening price into a premium array, a sell-off is anticipated.
*   **Power Three Concept:**
    *   The presenter advocates applying the **Power Three** concept to intraday sessions.
    *   He emphasizes that the algorithm views price action fractally.
*   **Judas Swing:** The opening price is considered a **Judas Swing**, a form of manipulation into a premium.

## **XXVIII. Model 2022 and Algorithmic Logic**

*   **Short-Term Premium Array:** A rally back to a short-term premium array is expected to lead to further selling.
*   **Model 2022 Identification:** Taking out a low is identified as **Model 2022**.
*   **Applying Logic to Market Segments:** The same logic used at the 9:30 AM opening can be applied to smaller market segments.
*   **Algorithmic Protraction:**
    *   The algorithm uses protraction from the opening price when bearish.
    *   It aims for undelivered targets lower.
    *   The market creates a short-term overbought condition.

## **XXIX. Fair Value Gaps and Target Refinement**

*   **Fair Value Gap as Entry:** The market trades up into a fair value gap, offering another selling opportunity.
*   **Equilibrium and Fair Value Gap:**
    *   A midpoint equilibrium is calculated from a high to a low.
    *   A fair value gap at or above equilibrium is sought.
*   **Pyramiding and Partialing:**
    *   Sellers can pyramid their positions.
    *   Wait for Southside liquidity to be broken before taking partial profits.
*   **Targeting Refinement:**
    *   Avoid using the low of a fair value gap as a precise target.
    *   Aim for a point or half-point above the low.
    *   Account for liquidity pairing with limit orders.

## **XXX. Afternoon Session Analysis and Market Structure Shift**

*   **One-Minute Chart Focus:** Analysis shifts to the one-minute chart in the afternoon session.
*   **Fair Value Gap from Five-Minute Chart:** A fair value gap from the five-minute chart during the New York lunch hour is extended in time.
*   **Shift in Market Structure:**
    *   Taking out a low in the afternoon after a rally is identified as a shift in market structure.
    *   This confirms the shift below the five-minute low.
*   **Relating One-Minute to Five-Minute Charts:** The five-minute fair value gap (rectangle) is referenced on the one-minute chart.

## **XXXI. Multi-Timeframe Analysis and Daily Low Considerations**

*   **Equal Lows on Five-Minute Chart:** Two equal lows on the five-minute chart transpose to the one-minute chart.
*   **Returning to Fair Value Gap:** Price returns to the five-minute fair value gap represented by the rectangle.
*   **Multiple Timeframe Confluence:**
    *   The presenter emphasizes looking at a one-minute, 30-second, and 15-second chart simultaneously.
    *   He looks for opportunities to build positions based on premium arrays within his risk model.
*   **Old Daily Low (3961.75):**
    *   Breaking below 3961.75 (an old daily low) triggers shorts.
    *   Covering occurs below that level.

## **XXXII. Differentiating ICT Concepts from Basic Support and Resistance**

*   **Beyond Support and Resistance:** The presenter refutes the idea that his concepts are merely support and resistance.
*   **Need for PD Arrays:**
    *   He needs to see a **PD Array** (like a fair value gap or bearish breaker) for algorithmic confirmation.
    *   Returning to an old daily low alone isn't enough to trigger a short.
*   **Addressing Critics:** He responds to critics who label his analysis as "cherry-picked."
*   **Finite Levels vs. Zones:** The presenter contrasts his specific levels with ambiguous supply and demand zones.

## **XXXIII. Algorithmic Precision and Market Manipulation**

*   **Time of Day Significance:** The timing of events, such as the last hour of trading (3:00 PM to 4:15 PM), matters.
*   **Judas Swing Confirmation:** The opening price acts as a **Judas Swing**, trading up into a fair value gap before breaking down.
*   **Dynamic Liquidity Matrix:**
    *   Daily highs and lows from the last three days create a dynamic matrix of liquidity.
    *   "Today" is day one, "yesterday" is day two, and "the day before yesterday" is day three.
*   **Model Specificity:** Aligned **PD arrays** with old daily lows in the last hour of trading are key setups.

## **XXXIV. Perfect Setups and Undeniable Evidence**

*   **Market Manipulation:** The market runs up to "fix people out" before breaking down and returning to a fair value gap.
*   **Respect for Fair Value Gap:** Bodies of candles respecting the fair value gap high is algorithmic confirmation.
*   **Fair Value Gap Precision:** The price runs to the fair value gap high, then trades down to its midpoint (consequent encroachment).
*   **Stop Placement:** Stops are placed at the bottom of the fair value gap, perfectly stopping at the midpoint.
*   **Technical Science vs. Retail Mumbo Jumbo:** He contrasts his technical science with retail trading concepts.

## **XXXV. Personal Reflections and Market Access**

*   **Value of Sharing Knowledge:** The presenter reflects on sharing his knowledge, acknowledging both its value and the challenges.
*   **Limited Time and Opportunity:** He emphasizes the limited time available to learn from him.
*   **Fair Value Gap Interaction:**
    *   Price moves from the fair value gap to its low with tick precision.
    *   It then trades back up, stopping at the midpoint (consequent encroachment).
*   **Randomness vs. Algorithmic Precision:** He challenges the idea that these precise movements are random.

## **XXXVI. The Incontrovertible Nature of Algorithmic Trading**

*   **Challenging Conventional Beliefs:** He acknowledges that his audience may hold different beliefs about the market.
*   **Evidence of Algorithmic Control:** He presents evidence of algorithmic control and his ability to navigate it.
*   **Call to Action:** He encourages the audience to use his information to improve their lives.

Okay, here's the reorganized and refined text, preserving all details and nuances, while improving clarity and structure.

## Market Analysis: January 15, 2023 (Pre-Market)

**Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0CYBeFTzcM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0CYBeFTzcM)

This analysis reflects the market conditions *before* the Sunday/Monday market open. Keep in mind that Sunday openings are always a "50/50" situation and can drastically alter the anticipated scenarios. The analyst prefers to wait until the Monday 9:30 AM opening to see how traders digest and build their liquidity pools.

### 1. Dollar Index (DXY)

*   **Daily Chart:**
    *   The levels previously identified in the first week of January remain relevant.
    *   A specific level (drawn out) was mentioned, and a break below it would target the sell-side liquidity below. This seems likely to occur.
    *   **Volume and Balance:** As long as the price remains *below* the discussed levels, the discount arrays (relative equal lows), fair value gap, and order block are the likely targets.
    *   A small gap between one candle's high and another's low has already been reached.
    *   **Important Note:** Be mindful of Friday's High.
*   **Potential Scenarios & Key Levels:**
    *   The only thing that would change the near-term bearish outlook is if the price trades *above* the fair value gap *below* Wednesday's low and Friday's High ("net separation").
    *   If that scenario unfolds, and the price subsequently finds support, there would be two areas of imbalance that might cause a bounce.
    *   **Next Draw on Liquidity (Bearish Scenario):** 101.30 - 101.29.
*   **Hourly Chart:**
    *   The price action exhibits a balanced price range.
    *   It is more likely to gravitate toward the low of this range than move higher *before Sunday's opening*.
*   **Anticipated Movement (Pre-Sunday):**
    *   The analyst anticipates the Dollar Index will remain heavy.
    *   Ideal scenario: Gap down, rally to fill the gap, then move towards the lower target.
*   **Alternative (Bullish) Scenario:**
    *   If the price reverses and moves above the imbalance (on both the hourly and daily charts), then:
        *   Relative equal highs exist for buy-side liquidity.
        *   There's a bearish breaker (down-closed candle). Draw this on your chart.
*   **Overall Outlook:** Risk one scenario (slightly weaker dollar) is currently favored.

### 2. Euro Dollar (EUR/USD)

*   **Daily Chart:**
    *   Previously outlined levels remain in play.
    *   Price action worked through levels, took buy-side liquidity, and pierced higher.
    *   **Next Area of Buy-Side Liquidity:** Highlighted on the chart.
    *   **Sell-Side Imbalance Buy-Side Inefficiency (SIBI):** A fair value gap exists.
    *   If the price moves higher, pay attention to this fair value gap, as it is a "clean" imbalance and could see repricing.
*   **Hourly Chart:**
    *   Similar price action to the Dollar Index (initial strength shown).
    *   If the price moves up into the imbalance (SIBI fair value gap), *and* trades above it, then the area *below* should not be retested until higher targets are achieved.
    *   **Next Target (Bullish Scenario):** Approximately 1.09 - 1.0905, *barring any reversals*.
*   **Alternative (Bearish) Scenario:**
    *   If there is a gap down and fill, then sell-side liquidity resting below becomes the target.
*   **Overall Outlook:** Higher prices for Euro, contingent on higher time frame analysis holding true.

### 3. E-Mini S&P 500 (ES)

*   **Weekly Chart:**
    *   Nice expansion last week.
    *   Pay attention to the *consequent encroachment* on the wick (halfway point).
    *   Be mindful of a specific level (not annotated due to chart clutter).
*   **Potential Bearish Scenario:**
    *   If the price drops, the low of the candle (which is also the high of the fair value gap represented by three candles) needs to act as support.
    *   Or, the halfway point of a consequent encroachment needs to hold.
    *   If the price trades *back down into* this area, it would be concerning.
    *   **Last Line of Defense for Bulls (Longer Term):** Midpoint of the fair value gap on the weekly chart.
*   **Bullish Objective:** Midpoint of a specific weekly candle wick (several weeks prior).
    *   To find this level: Use Fibonacci retracement from the open to the high; the 50% level is the target.
*   **Hourly Chart:**
    *   The analyst is referencing levels given on Twitter:
        *   Order block.
        *   Relative equal highs.
    *   Initial expectation: Price would trade down into the order block area, potentially taking out the low and reaching the wick below.
    *   Buy-side liquidity has already been taken.
    *   **Target:** 4030 (missed 4030, only got to 4020).
*   **Ideal Bullish Scenario:**
    *   Gap up, trade back down to close the gap, then continue upwards.
*   **Concerning (Bearish) Scenario:**
    *   Gap lower, fill the gap, and then sell off.
    *   There's a small gap that may need to be filled if the price gaps lower.
*   **Gaps & Market Movement:**
    *   A "breakaway gap" leads to a "measuring gap," setting the stage for targets around 4045 - 4040.
    *   Buy-side liquidity is resting above relative equal highs.
*   **CPI Release & Market Maker Buy Model (1-Minute, 5-Minute Charts):**
    *   CPI data was reviewed live on the one-minute chart.
    *   **Consequent Encroachment (Friday's Low Wick):** Split the low wick in half. This is also half of the fair value gap.
    *   Market trades up into a fair value gap, retraces, then overlaps and rolls up.
    *   A small gap was created, filled, and the price rallied.
    *   Small gap, retested, then price moved to the order block and rallied again.
    *   The price action "digs into" the bullish breaker candle, gravitating toward the 4020 level.
    *   **Market Maker Buy Model Breakdown:**
        *   Consolidation.
        *   Leaving consolidation.
        *   Return to consolidation (sell distribution, smart money reversal).
        *   Low-risk buy imbalance, carry through.
        *   Retrace to accumulation of longs.
        *   Rallies.
        *   Secondary buy.
        *   Consequent encroachment of the gap midpoint.
        *   Rallies.
        *   Order block finds support.
        *   Consolidation, then run up near the close of the day to the 4020 level, clearing the old high for buy-side liquidity.

*   **Overall Outlook:**

    *   Continuously looking for reasons to allow bullishness on the buy side for index futures.
    *   Aware of potential changes based on the Sunday gap opening. The analyst waits for Monday's 9:30 AM open.

# Market Analysis and Trading Room Update (Week of [Date])

## Personal Update and Trading Room Progress

Good afternoon, folks! I hope everyone is doing well. This will likely be my only review for this week due to personal matters. My wife and I are still unpacking and settling into our home, which requires my attention.

*   I also have a gift to hang up in my trading room. I promised the sender I'd display it before showing the room.
*   I expect to complete this task, likely over the weekend.

## Dollar Index Analysis

### Daily Chart Observations

Here's the daily chart for the **Dollar Index**.

*   I was anticipating lower prices.
*   Currently, the price is meandering around below a fair value gap.
*   It shows reluctance to dip below a specific low.
*   My expectation is a potential large candle formation tonight or tomorrow, reaching below that low.
*   There's a possibility it might even dip into the **101 big figure**.
*   If this signifies a sustained decline, it could lead to a reach for lower levels.

This scenario would potentially allow for upside movement on Euro, Cable, and other foreign currencies.

## Euro/Dollar Analysis

### Daily Chart Observations

Here's the **Euro/Dollar** daily chart.

*   We have taken out the buy-side liquidity.
*   We are approaching the next buy-side liquidity target.
*   Should we get animated to the upside with a fair value gap in a down closed candle that would be the next draw on liquidity above this buy side.

#### Potential Scenario Change:

If the price trades below the mean threshold (midpoint) of this down-closed candle:

*   There's a higher likelihood of reaching for a return to equilibrium, representing a short-term discount.
*   This would be within the breaker, at a low-high-lower low.
*   We never really came back to that except for a small little brief retrade right here.
*   If we break below midpoint of this down closed candle, look for the breaker.
*   Still primarily looking for buy-side liquidity.

**Disclaimer:** I am not actively trading Forex. This analysis is being provided due to my earlier commitment to cover Forex for those interested.

### Remaining Imbalances

*   Remaining balance of this sell-side and balanced buy-side inefficiency.
*   The market is likely to "punch through" that level.
*   Look for **125 even (big figure)**.
*   Any animated upside could target a phospholic pool around **126.67**.

#### Scenario Change:

*   If we take out the low here, my bullish stance will change.

## NASDAQ Analysis

### Daily Chart Observations

This is the daily chart for **NASDAQ**.

*   Pay attention to the old high at **12339 even.**
*   Also, consider the consequent encroachment of that wick.

#### Wick as Gap Explanation:

*   The algorithm considers a wick as a gap.
*   Gaps are most likely to be traded to their consequent encroachment (midpoint).

#### Order Block Theory vs. Gap Theory:

*   It's essential to distinguish between my order block theory and gap theory.
*   While similar in some aspects, they are distinct.
*   We'll cover this more thoroughly during the 2023 mentorship.

### Bullish Order Block

*   We have two down-closed candles forming a bullish order block.
*   High of the first candle to low of the second candle represents a buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency (BISI).
*   The market trades down into this order block (open to high).

#### Important Levels:

*   Be mindful of the blue-shaded area representing the imbalance (from here to here on the single candle).
*   The two heavy blue lines represent the order block.

Based on this:

*   The market appears to have traded down, picked up a discount, pulled off the low.
*   I'm anticipating a trade up to around **12149 even** tomorrow (going into Friday).

### Hourly Chart Observations

*   Immediately focus on the clean level: relative equal lows.
*   Here is the daily BISI (buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency) from the daily chart.

#### Breaker Pattern:

*   The market ran up, took out a short-term high, and broke lower.
*   High-low-higher high pattern.
*   Down-closed candle represents a bearish breaker.
*   The market trades below it, comes back up, "bumps" it, and sells off to take out sell-side liquidity.
*   Imbalances exist in these areas, which we will examine more closely.

### 15-Minute Timeframe

*   The buy-side looks really cool here.
*   Clean jagged edges are the result, smooth edges like to be made but jagged.
*   Fair value gap present.

#### Current Market Dynamics:

*   The market trades down into the fair value gap and comes back up as a support.
*   It rallies through the short-term high.
*   Trades up into the imbalance.
*   I'm watching tonight into tomorrow, whether we continuously press higher.

#### Three-Drive Pattern Skepticism:

*   It appears to be a potential three-drive pattern (1, 2, 3).
*   However, I don't fully trust it.
*   It feels like the market makers may attempt to push it higher.
*   I'm comfortable being wrong in my assessment.

#### Breaker Analysis:

*   While this high acts as a nice breaker, it contains multiple breakers within it.
    *   High, low, higher high and down closed candle.

#### Potential Scenarios:

*   Watching to see if we disrespect this.
*   This area is actually a balanced price range that needs to be cleared.
*   If we trade aggressively above this range, the levels mentioned on the daily chart become more reasonable.
*   Otherwise, we could see choppy trading.

#### Sell-Off Expectations:

*   I don't anticipate a major sell-off just yet.
*   We had a significant move on the 24th, which I outlined in real-time.
*   The market was within two handles of the daily high, leading to the rotation lower.
*   Note: This was referring to ES (E-mini S&P), not NASDAQ, but the principle is similar.

### 15-Minute Timeframe (Imbalance Focus)

Here's the 15-minute timeframe, focusing on the imbalance.

*   Sell-side liquidity and fair value gap present.
*   It digs down into that gap.
*   It's also the low end of the sensitive price point of a bullish order block, which is the opening price and the high.
*   The market trades down into it, hits it, and reacts.

#### Deeper Dive

Let's take a closer look inside this area.

### 2-Minute Chart

*   We are dropping down to the two-minute chart.
    *   Why? To save time. This chart contains the most detail.

#### Key Observations

*   **Buy Stops:** present.
*   Smooth relative equal highs.
*   Smooth relative equal highs.
*   Breaks order block trades back to it here.
*   Sells off.
*   Trades into our imbalance.
*   Digs into the lower end (opening price of the down-closed candle on the daily chart, which is a bullish order block).

#### Recap of Key Levels

*   **Important Reminder:** Rewatch this segment several times!
*   This level represents the opening price on the daily chart down candle.
*   We trade down into it, taking out sell-side liquidity.
*   The market then trades higher and back down into a fair value gap (after sell-side has been taken).
*   A higher timeframe order block has been traded to.
*   Mount rallies.
*   Trades above short-term highs, indicating a shift in market structure.
*   Fair value gap present.

#### Bullish Breaker and Mitigation

*   Trades down into consequent encroachment (midpoint between candle's low and high).
*   A bullish breaker is present.
    *   Low, high, lower low.
    *   Extend the body of the uppermost (up-close) candle forward.

*   You're doing it with the up close candle, not the down closed candle when using bullish Breakers.
*   We find some support in this consequent encroachment.
*   You want gaps like this to stay open, promoting the idea of a breakaway gap.
*   The market rallies back up into the last up-close candle.
*   This would be a breaker by any other definition, but because we are elongated from that high in order to keep stretching further when we trade back to it and above it it's mitigation.
    *   Mitigation = any trader that's offside that was going long in here, they can mitigate that trade here.

#### IMPORTANT POINT: Order Blocks and Mitigation

*   Order blocks and candles are NOT mitigating.
*   Mitigating is the *action* of the trader that is offside.
*   Prices allowing the trader to mitigate their offside position.
*   Mitigating potential drawdown, limiting it or removing it altogether.

#### Additional Factors

*   Trades down into here.
*   We have a buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency.
    *   High and Low.
*   We dip into that partially.
*   Why didn't we come down to this level here?
*   Because the mitigation block leave some of that open.
*   Expect it to be institutional order flow entry view, which is a partial entry to a fair value gap before resuming higher.
*   The market reaches up into Dubai South Dakota, which creates a bullish order block.

#### Order Block Accumulation

*   Trades down into here.
*   Rallies.
*   Fair value gap present.
*   Consolidates, accumulating more long positions and rallies away.
*   What level is this accumulating Longs at?
    *   At the high of the daily bullish order block Wick.
    *   Wick down here is the daily order block opening price.

*   This is the high Wick area.

#### Market Rally and Order Block Retest

*   Market rally up.
*   Order block retest here.
*   Continues to move higher.

### Afternoon Session (NASDAQ)

*   Dropping into still the two-minute chart.
*   New York launch begins and ends.
*   Run from the order block and fair value gap.
*   Rally around the high of the daily bullish order block Wick High.
*   Rallies.
*   Order block, as mentioned before, we transitioned into the PM session slide here a little institutional order flow integral right there I don't have that I apologize.

#### Order Block Progression

*   Fair value gap with an order block trades into it here rallies.
*   Order block cut through candles folks little shoulder block rallies.
*   Another order block (1, 2, 3).

##### Determining Order Block Significance:

*   Why use only this one candle here and not all of these here?
*   Because all these candles are going against order flow.
*   Order flow is bullish.

*   If there's a series of down-closed candles and we rally through it strongly:

    *   Go back to that original High candle.
    *   Extend it forward.

*   We have an imbalance.
*   We have a potential order block here.
*   Not interested in that because the candle's body on this one goes lower than that one.
*   There's rules, levels to all of this.

#### Final Rally Push

*   The market drops into the order block.
*   Accumulates.
*   Rises again.
*   Small fair value gap present in between.
*   Extends it through accumulates Longs here here and then once more over here.
*   Why? Because it needs to go higher.
*   Last hour of trading (macro runs from 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM).

#### Conclusion:

*   Change down to your block everyone thinks the highs in place pumps it through yourself by side rolling on over into.

## E-mini S&P Analysis

### Daily Chart Observations

*   High is important (not shown on the chart to emphasize the distinctions between levels).
*   Consequent encroachment of this wick (**4117.75**).
*   Consequent encroachment of this candle's wick (**4072.75**).

#### Accumulation Pattern Similar to NASDAQ

*   Like NASDAQ, we see accumulation from this original fair value gap.
*   Bouncing and trading up, stopping here.
*   Most Traders would expect a sell-off (as mentioned during live tweets and commentary).
*   The market rallied through, attacking the buy-side.

#### Trading Strategy via Twitter

*   As was mentioned, we would likely see the Twitter storm that I send out in terms of Market commentary and things that pretty much keep your eye on and study tape read via my tweets the market does in fact deliver that.

#### Inside Day Candle Formation

*   Small candle (inside day):
    *   Its high is lower than the previous day's.
    *   Its low is higher than the previous day's.
*   Expect a large range day following this type of scenario.

#### Retracement and Consequent Encroachment

*   The market came all the way back down into this buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency (green candle).
*   The buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency fair value gap is framed with this candle's high this candle is low split.
*   The range between here and here creates a consequent encroachment.
*   The algorithm uses daily chart reference points.
*   The narrative is closely linked to this timeframe.
*   Need to know your key levels off of this daily chart carrying those ideas and levels over into the hourly chart.

### Hourly Chart

*   Market ride up on the pass through here Consolidated relative equal lows.
*   South Side liquidity is below.
*   Small imbalances are in purple (hard to see).

#### Imbalance Dynamics

*   Leave this one open (why?) This is the part where you write down in your notebook.
*   When you have a larger imbalance like this blue shaded one from the daily chart if I'm bullish.
*   I want to see the majority of the reactions in the upper portion which would be the premium level of the imbalance.

#### Continuations vs. Inversions

*   When you're looking for continuations don't see this trading down to this level here in upper portion like I have here the upper half of the fair value Gap.
*   When it trades back down into it, creates what an inversion.
*   Premium becomes discount.

**NOTE:** This is confusing and will be revisited during the 2023 course.
The goal is to teach WHY some imbalances stay open.

#### Final Thoughts

I just can't do a five-minute trainer video. I just can't write a paragraph or a tweet and explain it and you can run away and start making courses about it because you still don't know what I'm talking about.

# E-mini S&P (ES) Analysis: Imbalances, Order Flow, and Algorithmic Theory

## Understanding Key Imbalances and Fair Value Gaps

The core concept is that some imbalances will remain open, while others need to be filled. I want the ones in the upper half of the **Fair Value Gap** on the daily chart, above consequent encroachment, filled.

*   It's an even stronger signal if they don't fill.
*   Imbalances in the lower half are better left open. If they fill, the market isn't as bullish, and the algorithm may chop around and consolidate longer.
*   Seeing specific scenarios unfold makes it seem like a "loaded deal," almost guaranteed. It indicates the high likelihood of a significant reaction.

This is why I sometimes trade aggressively, buying right as the price falls into the lowest low. These scenarios allow me to trust that lower areas won't be targeted.

*   Keep an eye on the imbalance in the pink area.
*   The next objective is the wick as consequent encroachment at **4043.25**.
*   The rejection block we saw traded to today was at **4038.75.**

### Analyzing the Range: Equilibrium and Discount

Let’s consider the perspective of the entire range. From high to low, we can identify the equilibrium.

*   The current price is in a **discount**.
*   We're in the upper portion of the daily **Fair Value Gap**, in the form of buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency (BISI). This is the blue-shaded box.
*   The upper portion is ideal for intraday charts trading down into, creating a discount relative to the low-to-high range.

This demonstrates how intricate the web is, as we move from higher to lower timeframes.

*   If you don't know my stuff, you can easily get inundated and lost.
*   Algorithmic theory must be understood.
*   You can't just look at down-close candles and assume they're order blocks, or every candle resembling a Fair Value Gap and expect a trade.
*   There has to be narrative wrapped around it.
*   None of those running around trying to teach my course materials have any idea what they're doing, so stop. You're hurting other people.

## 15-Minute Timeframe Analysis: Respecting Levels and Balanced Price Ranges

On the **15-minute timeframe**, we dropped down from the **Fair Value Gap**.

*   We went below the low and came back up.
*   Notice how it's really respecting the **consequent encroachment**, the midpoint of the pink-shaded area.
*   It acts as resistance, just as it acted as support earlier.
*   If we break through it, the whole shaded area becomes a balanced price range.

This price range has delivered both sides (up and down).

*   **Consequent encroachment** becomes the last line of defense.
*   A nasty plunge drops lower, creating a small **Fair Value Gap**.
*   Beautiful delivery down into our lower-level hourly **Fair Value Gap**, digging into it perfectly (well, off by one quarter of a point).
*   Consolidation leads to creating a **Fair Value Gap**, as I mentioned live.

I was watching all this on my phone, admittedly sneaking while with my wife. I was in stealth mode trying to give commentary.

*   I wasn't supposed to be on Twitter today, but I surreptitiously did it. Sneaky ICT.

### SIBI Project Analysis

Notice also this **SIBI project** that ran through.

*   We come back down into it in consequent encroachment once more.
*   Bam!

You're going to hear all kinds of wild stuff when I'm doing live streams.

*   There will be things you've never heard me say.
*   Whenever there's animation on my part, and especially if my son does something right, I'm going to be cheerleading him.
*   Just get yourself ready for all that business.

The market rallies up, takes out the buy-side, and digs into the last up-close candle. This is a change in the state of delivery.

## 5-Minute Chart: Key Levels and Market Dynamics

Here's the **5-minute chart**.

*   We sell South Dakota here, digging below it.
*   It's the hourly Fair Value Gap and the one at consequent encroachment.

Remember, we don't want to see the lower half of that daily buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency, which is that big blue-shaded area, trade down below consequent encroachment.

*   We're focusing on the upper portion.
*   If it's going to turn here and start presenting arrays that we can time off for a long or a shift higher in price, it's better for it to do that there than to dig into the lower portion of that buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency on the daily chart.

This is one of those videos you have to watch a few times.

*   What I'm saying isn't going to register until you watch the first portion of the video, pertaining to ES.
*   It takes a couple of times to see where we're at in the lower timeframes and what these areas are.

You can quickly see why I am not painting all this stuff on my charts when I'm watching it.

*   To me, this is extremely busy.
*   I'm showing you the overlap of all of these convergences that the algorithm is going to refer to.
*   It's not supply and demand or support and resistance.
*   The market is going to key off of very specific prices: the high, the middle point, or the low.

### Understanding Algorithm Logic

There's logic in knowing which one you want to see hit and which ones you don't want to see hit, and I'm going to do that throughout this year.

*   That's the only way you can learn it.

Knowing what I know that's been codified, I can't simply say these are the rules that are going to work every single time.

*   There are going to be things that the algorithm is going to do based on what factors are in price action at that time, on that day of the week, and that time of day.
*   All those things coming together and being equal, you're going to have certain rules and processes that you're going to have to consider.

I'm not going to teach you every possible scenario because that would take years, and frankly, I don't promise that to you anyway.

*   That's pretty much what makes me who I am, and my family members are privy to that.
*   The general public, I don't owe that to you.

I'm doing as much as I can, obviously, and much more than any of you really would have discovered.

*   I'm hoping that this is going to be enough this year for somebody. It won't be for everyone, and that's okay.

Take your attention here.

*   We have this candle here, this candle here, and then this candle right there.

The market reacts from the low end of the hourly **Fair Value Gap** that joins and links with the consequent encroachment of that daily buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency (the blue rectangle).

*   It rallies up, creating a short-term high.
*   This candle pierces it, creating this candle here.

The market trades down into it once more.

*   It opens and then runs away.
*   Order block chased down, retouches it, and rallies.
*   Consolidates and rises again into our old shaded area.

It dips back down.

*   Is it going to be resistance here? No.

We have now turned the corner down here.

*   I mentioned that if we went to **3977.75**, that's the end of the line.
*   That means it's over.
*   The bearish sentiment is no longer valid.
*   We would be considering what the end of their sentiment is: now bullish.

### Twitter Mentions

Go watch and look at the tweets. I'm not going to show you in the tweets.

*   That's your job to go through the tweets.
*   In here, I give a very specific candle to talk about a **Fair Value Gap**.

We'll look at that when you're driving on the lower timeframes.

*   It rides away and comes back down into the buy-side of the also-sell-side inefficiency here.
*   What the order block trades to a bear rallies through and presses into the afternoon **4038.75** level.

## 1-Minute Chart: Judas Swing and Market Structure Shifts

On the **1-minute chart**, you can see how we dropped from that **15-minute timeframe** **Fair Value Gap**.

*   We traded up into it.
*   Here is the **Judas Swing** after taking buy-side liquidity.
*   This right here had everybody thinking it's going to rip higher.
*   I was watching several live streamers this morning.
*   They got really animated here.
*   They were actually wishing and cheerleading, hoping it goes higher.

The more they did that, the more I felt confident that it was going to sell off.

*   I actually sold off a position here, built it larger here, and rode it all the way down into this level here.
*   I went short, building up another position.
*   I was calling all this stuff on the fly on a telephone.

I was looking at all the things I look for, doing all the measurements I look for Fibonacci extensions levels a little higher timeframes working down.

*   I came to the idea that **3962.50** would be likely.
*   I had a limit order to get out at **3962.75**, but it didn't give it to me.
*   The market didn't actually go that low.

The market did in fact rally here.

*   Look at this high here, it's great with alignment balances.
*   See this high here? This candle's high is higher than that one, and then this candle is lower than that one.
*   This is your swing high.

The market rallies through that's a **shift in market structure**.

*   ICT, it didn't close above that high.
*   I didn't say it had to.

Go back and watch the videos on the 2022 model.

*   A **shift in market structure** does not ever require a close above a short-term high when it's shifting bullish.
*   It does not require a close below the swing low when it's shifting bearish.
*   Stop spreading misinformation and stop perpetuating ignorance.

This is the reason why people complain to me, because they're learning from dollar menu mentorships, and they're not learning from someone that can do it.

*   Number one, they didn't author it.
*   They have no idea what it is.
*   They have no idea when it won't work, when it's likely to be there, when it's not likely to be there.

That shift here is bullish.

*   This drop down here, it's a suspect decline.
*   It's a **Judas swing** in many ways.
*   Where's it going?
*   Where have I got trades in?
*   Consequent encroachment midpoint.
*   How nice is that?

The market rallies, takes out the short-term high here.

*   Another **Fair Value Gap** here.

Here's where I stated, "Look, look at that candle right there on a **1-minute chart**."

*   That candle is your **Fair Value Gap**.

I said you got homework today.

*   I gave you a task of looking for two five-handle price runs before noon.
*   Well, I know some of you were not able to get two, so I'll give you one today.

Here is the candle that range extended through it touches it here, here, here, here.

*   I said you want to take your attention to **3982**, buy-side liquidity, which is this short-term high.
*   Why that one?
*   Because it's going to offer five handles easy.

It delivers like gangbusters.

*   I'm walking around, I'm looking at my phone.
*   I'm looking at all this price action here through the lens of what my Galaxy Note 10.
*   My cell phone can only show me so much, and my 50-year-old eyes they're not as good as they used to be, so it is what it is.

It ran off a lot more than I thought.

*   I was going to be able to catch something in the afternoon, but it did the majority of the run right after me calling this live on Twitter.
*   It just left. You know, Elvis left the building right there.
*   Stocking this season went with him.

We consolidate in here rip through, took the buy-side here, back into that imbalance on the hourly chart, an hourly break of continuity in price action during the New York lunch hour.

*   You can see that here.
*   We drop back down into the possible efficiency hits the order block here.
*   Beautiful rally accumulates at the low end of that old hourly imbalance, the pink-shaded area.

There you go.

*   It rallies once more, and you're going to want to go through your charts and see what these levels are.

## Mastering ICT Concepts: The Importance of Chart Study

This is the part where the lazy students, the casual readers, the Netflix ICT students, you're not going to get this.

*   You might be entertained or maybe bored to death by watching my videos, but I can tell you this: if you don't go into your charts and look for the things I'm annotating here on mine, if you're just simply watching mine, you are not learning.
*   You're not doing the quote-unquote work that's required.

This is the part that none of my students that paid me for mentorship did.

*   They didn't then take that information into live data and watch price print.
*   If they had jobs or if they went to school or if they couldn't be awake during that time, they didn't make an investment to record price in a screen recorder and then study it that way.

There's no excuse, zero excuse, for you not to be going into your charts, because if you don't do that, you're not going to get the blue ribbon results you're hoping for at the end.

Creates a decline in here, order block trades into here, rips higher, Fair Value Gap digs into it here with an order block rallies again by side taken here.

*   False high drops back down the last hour of trading between 3:00 and 4:00.
*   Order block extends it through why this one?
*   Because we're not supplying demand. We cut through candles.

This is the most significant price point this one here.

*   Lastly, down-closed candles through this price action hits it here.
*   Last hour macro comes in right when you're expecting it to.
*   Rallies up, takes the buy-side out.

Bam! Hits the **4038.75** level.

*   Go back to the beginning of the discussion for ES and see what that is on the daily chart that's where you derive it from.

That, my friends and neighbors, is going to be it for today.

*   I hope you had a good week with me.
*   I'm closing shop early, so Thursday's trading into Friday's trading.
*   I might do some personal trades and then show you like a short little vignette-type thing, but as far as like YouTube videos, I gotta rest a little bit more.

We're coming up close to when I'm going to be really delivering on a day-by-day basis.

*   I'm trying to enjoy the time even though I'm trying to keep myself close to the marketplace and not get rusty by staying away from the market for a few weeks.
*   This way, it keeps me close, keeps my finger on the pulse of the market sentiment and order flow, and then we'll see what we get.

If I do something tomorrow in trading and I can record something, I will.

*   If I can't, I'll try to do something on a Friday, and otherwise, we will talk on a shotgun Saturday on Twitter.
*   Until then, be safe.

## Detailed Market Analysis: December 26, 2023

**Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1thfpo-R9U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1thfpo-R9U)

This is a quick review of today's price action in stock index futures. The speaker will not be trading tomorrow, enjoying a three-day weekend.

###  Recap of Previous Analysis and Twitter Engagement

*   Last night's analysis video provided insights into market expectations.
*   Daily Twitter engagement offers commentary and identification of the next **draw on liquidity**, indicating potential market direction.
*   Specific candle times are called out for annotation, enabling real-time price action monitoring.
*   Last night's analysis focused on the **E-mini S&P 500 (ES)**.

### Forex Market Commentary

*   Current Forex market conditions (Dollar Index, Euro Dollar, Pound Dollar) are described as "sloppy" and "choppy," although overall, they're trending higher (as predicted earlier in the year).
*   The speaker is avoiding Forex due to the lack of clean price action.
*   Focus is currently on **stock index futures**, due to the cleaner price action and more consistent delivery and symmetry.
*   When Forex markets become more fluid, the speaker promises to be more active in discussing them.

### S&P 500 Analysis - Key Levels and Timeframes

*   **Consequent encroachment** of a specific candle's wick at **4072.75** was highlighted in last night's review.
*   This level acted as a target during the trading day.
*   A dashed line indicates an old high.
*   The analysis primarily focuses on the **15-minute timeframe**. This timeframe is considered a "Bellwether" and provides most of the information needed, relative to weekly and daily timeframes.

### 15-Minute Timeframe and Draw on Liquidity

*   Understanding the draw on liquidity from higher timeframes (daily, weekly) allows for efficient trade idea generation using the 15-minute chart.
*   Focus is solely on the **E-mini S&P 500 (ES)**, excluding NASDAQ.
*   The purpose is to demonstrate how to focus on a single market to simplify trading decisions.
*   New traders often struggle with deciding when to switch between NASDAQ and the E-mini S&P 500. By sticking to one market, new traders can avoid confusion and focus on reading price action.
*   Experienced traders may move between markets, but new traders should focus on building experience.

### Morning Session Analysis: December 26, 2023

*   The **midnight opening price** of **4036.75** is marked with a purple line.
*   Long positions were anticipated based on last night's analysis.
*   The ideal scenario involved the algorithm repricing below the midnight price.
*   At **8:30 AM**, the market dipped below the midnight price.
*   At **10:45 AM**, the market attacked an old low, remaining below the midnight price.
*   This allowed smart money traders to enter long positions targeting the **4072.75** level.
*   These levels were shared on Twitter, serving as a reminder.
*   The speaker notes that catalyst can support or negate a scenario in the marketplace.
*   The speaker rarely gives definitive predictions, unless with strong conviction.
*   The 4072.75 level was reached by the ES, while NASDAQ did not deliver.
*   The speaker reiterates the importance of focusing on the market being traded, disregarding other markets' performance.

### Rejection Block and Power 3 Concept

*   A **rejection block** formed after the market rallied at 9:00 AM.
*   The market broke down, then ran below the midnight opening price.
*   Intraday traders might identify scalping or day trading setups within this movement.
*   Swing traders should position themselves based on the broader trend.
*   The **Power 3** concept (accumulation, manipulation, distribution) is used to identify entry points.
*   The **Power 3** concept applies to daily/weekly ranges and intraday sessions.
*   In a bullish scenario, the low is expected to form below a key opening price (midnight New York time).
*   A move below the opening price collects sell-side liquidity, which is then counter-partied by smart money longs buying sell stops.
*   Swing traders can set alerts for dips below the opening price and place limit orders, targeting specific highs (today's high and the **4072.75** target).
*   Positions should be small (one contract or micro) to avoid excessive risk.

### Fair Value Gap and Market Dynamics

*   The market created a **fair value gap** and retraced into it (consequent encroachment).
*   This was called out live, predicting a rejection and a move towards the **4038** level (sell-side liquidity).
*   The market dropped, absorbed sell-side liquidity, retraced into an order block, rallied, and consolidated.
*   An hourly imbalance (fair value gap) was present in this consolidation range.
*   The market continued grinding higher, frustrating retail traders expecting a breakdown.
*   The speaker advises against shorting against this trend, emphasizing the algorithm's tendency to drive prices higher.
*   The importance of experience in identifying market movements is highlighted.

### One-Minute Chart Analysis and Key Time Windows

*   A shaded trend line denotes a specific time window, approximately from **9:30 AM to noon**.
*   This time frame should be the primary focus for morning session trading.
*   Look for inefficiencies, liquidity pools, and shifts in market structure (bullish or bearish) within this window.
*   The market made multiple higher highs before breaking down.
*   An imbalance occurred, which can be refined using the low and high of the range.
*   A specific candle was highlighted on Twitter as a key focus point.

### Twitter Commentary and Trade Execution

*   The speaker shared the chart on Twitter later in the day.
*   Viewers are encouraged to review the individual tweets between **8:30 AM and 11:00 AM** to understand the real-time analysis.
*   The speaker acknowledges the high frequency of tweets during the morning session.
*   Alerts can be turned off for those who prefer not to be bombarded with notifications.
*   The Twitter feed is not a signal service but rather a spotlight on specific price action, candle times, and target levels.
*   Specific tweets mentioned:
    *   Note of **4035 ES sell-side** liquidity.
    *   Note of the **10:38 one-minute candle fair value gap**.
    *   A preference for the fair value gap to remain unfilled and for the market to reach under the 9:56 low.
*   As the market rallied into the fair value gap, the speaker indicated a desire to see it reject immediately.
*   The market aggressively ran through sell-side liquidity.
*   The speaker reminded everyone to be square and out of the market at that point.
*   The opening price (4036.75) was revisited, with the market trading below it.
*   Smart money accumulated longs in this area, indicating that short positions should not be held.
*   The market rallied, built a fair value gap, accumulated, and entered the lunch hour consolidation.


## Detailed Breakdown of Market Commentary

This section provides an in-depth analysis of the speaker's market commentary, focusing on specific trading decisions, strategies, and insights shared during the session.

### Analysis of Specific Levels and Trade Setups

*   The speaker references a target level of **4051.25**, explaining it as a hypothetical stop-loss point, not a trade trigger.
*   This level is based on the high of a **fair value gap**. A stop-loss would be placed above it.
*   The **fair value gap** was only partially filled, aligning with the speaker's expectation.
*   This action was highlighted in a tweet at **10:43 AM**.
*   The market aggressively declined, reaching the speaker's objective.

### Tweeting Strategy and Market Interpretation

*   The speaker emphasizes that tweets are not trading signals. They're prompts indicating the current market position.
*   The timing of the tweet is crucial. If a level is mentioned below the current market price, it indicates an expected downward move.
*   Conversely, if a **buy-side liquidity** level is above the current market price, the expectation is for an upward move.
*   For instance, the speaker mentions a **10:38** candle, which created a fair value gap.
*   The suggestion is to analyze past reviews and ideas shared on Twitter and correlate them with personal charts.

### Learning to Trust Your Observations

*   The speaker believes individuals should learn to trust their own observations of price action.
*   The commentary is to teach listeners how to use the speaker's concepts.
*   The speaker walks listeners through current market conditions, indicating potential future movements and key levels for direction changes.
*   The analysis refers to buy-side or sell-side liquidity and specific time candles.
*   **Buy-side liquidity**: Look higher. **Sell-side liquidity**: Look lower.
*   Example: **09:56 low** identifies a specific low point on the chart.
*   The speaker does not send charts due to time constraints and a preference for clean charts. Annotations are added conceptually to illustrate the concepts.
*   The market was expected to reject a certain level and target sell-side liquidity.
*   The **4051.25** level was a hypothetical stop-loss. If the market reached it, the trade would have been invalid. Stop losses are crucial for risk management and preventing account ruin.

### Identifying Market Timing and Setups

*   The speaker encourages finding ways to time the market, identify setups, and grow independently within a community.
*   Over time, listeners should start recognizing these patterns without the speaker's direct input.
*   The speaker notes that students feel excitement when they anticipate moves that the speaker also identifies.
*   This demonstrates that the knowledge is transferable.

### Importance of Diligence

*   However, laziness inhibits the transfer of knowledge. Listeners must actively study.
*   The speaker emphasizes active learning: Taking people into a live chart.

### Afternoon Trading Session: Specific Trade Execution

*   The speaker mentioned last night a liking of the **4072.75** level.
*   The speaker reminded listeners this morning to look up to that target.
*   During the final hour of trading (**3 PM to 4 PM New York time**), the speaker looked for a specific low to be tagged.
*   The speaker entered with 10 contracts at **63.25**, the low of the move.
*   After a trade into the fair value gap with a down closed candle, the speaker entered with 10 more.
*   The speaker missed an opportunity to add 5 more contracts, intending to reach 25 total.
*   The speaker also skipped an additional entry at an order block.
*   Instead, the speaker decided to record the trade on a phone.
*   The speaker cautioned against trading on phones but uses it to monitor alerts and levels while away from a primary setup.
*   The goal is to enable independence, so traders won't require constant guidance.

### Exit Strategy and Addressing Trading Weaknesses

*   As the market approached the **4072.75** level, the speaker began peeling off contracts.
*   Ten contracts were sold at **4072.75**, and five more at **4073.00**.
*   The remaining balance was stopped out.
*   A recording on Twitter showed a limit order placed at **4076.00**.
*   This level was determined using Fibonacci projections from a specific low to a high.
*   The speaker admits that their "weakest point as a trader" is exits.
*   The speaker struggles with demanding an unrealistic, "best possible" exit.
*   To compensate, the speaker aims to capture 80-85% of the potential price run, scaling out positions.
*   The speaker seeks to exit while the market is still moving favorably.
*   While the speaker's precision in entries is noted, they continuously strive for better exits.

### Desensitizing to Entries

*   The speaker will work with their son on desensitization to entries.
*   This involves using a hypothetical $50,000 account on TradingView.
*   The speaker will demonstrate entries and decision-making processes in live sessions.
*   Beginners are unlikely to be as precise as they feel they should be.

### Realistic Profit Targets

*   Exiting can be simplified by targeting a static profit, like five handles.
*   Five handles is a realistic and achievable goal, with frequent opportunities.
*   Over time, traders can learn to identify setups with greater potential.
*   The speaker teaches five handle targets initially.
*   20-tick trades are common and can replace the need for a traditional job with proper money management.
*   The speaker doesn't promise riches but improved and more precise price reading skills.

### Mindset and Overcoming Losses

*   Losses can derail progress if they are perceived as personal failures.
*   The speaker will guide listeners through demo account exercises to manage drawdown and develop recovery skills.
*   Without these skills, traders risk panicking and making impulsive decisions with real money.
*   Listeners may be asked to do things that are against the rules of the marketplace to learn what NOT to do.

### Weekend Plans

*   The speaker will be away from Twitter tomorrow.
*   A Twitter Spaces podcast is planned for Saturday for general discussion.
*   The speaker concluded by wishing everyone a safe weekend.

### Analysis of Market Structure and Trading Strategy (February 10, 2023)

This document details an analysis of market structure and a specific trading strategy used on February 10, 2023. The analysis focuses on identifying key market turning points and using Fibonacci retracements with specific settings. The observations were initially shared on Twitter Spaces, with further live commentary on a YouTube stream on the same date.

**Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8bhZReDK-Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8bhZReDK-Q)

#### Understanding Lows: STL, LTL, and ITL

The analysis begins with defining different types of lows within the market structure.

*   **STL (Short-Term Low):** A low within a shorter timeframe.
*   **LTL (Long-Term Low):** A low formed between two intermediate-term lows.
*   **ITL (Intermediate-Term Low):** This is a crucial concept:

    *   An ITL is defined as a low that has a higher low to both its left and right.
    *   It's a "low that's lower than the previous short-term low and lower than the higher low."
    *   The example given highlights choosing an ITL because it went lower than a potential alternative low.

#### Bullish Expectations and "Buy Side" Targeting

If the market is bullish, the expectation is a "buy side" move upwards.

*   The speaker was explaining this live the day before.
*   The goal is to identify and target liquidity above existing highs (buy side liquidity).

#### Fibonacci (FIB) Settings and Application

The presenter emphasizes the FIB settings used for the analysis, displaying them to the audience so the concepts could be observed.

*   Specific settings are used to determine the potential daily range.
*   Specifically, how far the daily range can come off its high or low to find the closing price (this will be explained further "this year").
*   **Irrelevant settings:**
    *   Optimal Trade Entry levels are excluded.
    *   Equilibrium is excluded.

#### Identifying Key Price Levels

Using these Fibonacci settings, the following price levels were identified as potential targets:

*   The first price point to surpass the initial high was **4101.25**.
*   This high was identified as the reason for calling **4101.5**.
*   The next price target was **4104.25**.
*   These levels were identified using Fibonacci retracements anchored from a low and dragged to a high.

#### Application of Fibonacci and Market Context

The analysis then considers the context of the market structure when applying Fibonacci levels.

*   If a high is "relative" to another high, the negative one level on the Fibonacci cannot be used.
*   In this case, the next level is the negative 1.5 Fibonacci level.
*   If the market "bumps shallow" from an initial expectation, the expectation for the afternoon session is to "dig beyond that."
*   This means the first standard deviation may not hold.
*   The next standard deviation becomes the target.
*   **4104.25** occurs again as another point where the ITL is aiming for running the buy side.

#### Validation with Real-Time Market Data

The analysis is validated by comparing the price targets with the actual market data from the previous day (Friday).

*   The high of the day on Friday was **4104.25**.
*   The speaker points to a specific candle at 3:54 PM New York local time, where the high reached exactly **4104.25** to the tick.

#### Institutional Market Structure and Confluence

The key takeaway is that the trading strategy involves:

*   Looking for a confluence of standard deviations at key market turning points.
*   The speaker emphasizes that this is "institutional market structure" that isn't found in books.
*   It's being taught through mentorship programs.
*   It will be included in future books, primarily to establish authorship and prevent others from claiming the strategy as their own.
*   The market moved up into that buy side, hitting the 4104.25 level, "nailing the high."

#### "Final Hour Macro" (3:00 PM - 4:00 PM EST) and Algorithm Behavior

The analysis highlights a specific time window and algorithmic behavior.

*   The "final hour macro" refers to the last hour of trading before the 4:00 PM EST closing session (though trading extends to 5:00 PM, most volume is concentrated by 4:00 PM).
*   Specifically, the 30-minute interval from 3:15 PM to 3:45 PM is crucial.
*   During this time, the algorithm often executes a "market on close run."
*   The algorithm targets a point of liquidity that hasn't been targeted yet, but is the most obvious target (in this case, the buy side).

#### Supporting Evidence: Live Streamed Market Review

The speaker refers to a live stream on YouTube as further evidence.

*   The live stream was a market review and live tape reading event from February 10, 2023.
*   The speaker claims to have called "every single one of these minute candles exactly as you see it delivered here" and predicted the move up to 4104.
*   By combining the principles explained with the specific example from the live stream and the Twitter space, the listener will obtain a better understanding of the market activity on that Friday.

#### Additional Resources

*   **YouTube Channel:** Access the live stream by going to the YouTube channel, clicking on "Live," and finding the February 10, 2023, market review and live tape reading event.

#### Concluding Remarks

The speaker concludes with a standard sign-off, wishing the audience to "be safe."

### E-mini S&P Analysis: Daily Range and Intraday Expectations (Video URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKvjPltjsqU)

**Introduction**

Alright folks, welcome back!  In this analysis, we're focusing on the E-mini S&P 500, specifically using the daily chart.  I'm zoomed in closely to provide a detailed outline of the daily range: what I expected, what was likely to happen, and what actually transpired.

**Addressing Potential Critics and Maintaining Focus**

Before diving in, I want to address something. As my presence grows (on Twitter, YouTube, and upcoming live streams in February and beyond), I anticipate encountering individuals with preconceived notions, varying disciplines (or lack thereof), and opinions. These individuals often armchair quarterback *after* market events, claiming, "Everyone knew this was going to happen." However, these same people either lack a verifiable track record of execution, or they present results that weren't recorded in real-time. This, to me, feels disingenuous.

I'm striving to highlight specific observations, and I encourage *you*, the viewer, to analyze your own charts and diligently monitor the market. When I encounter such individuals on my Twitter account, I simply mute them. I'm not interested in unproductive dialogues with those who offer no substantial contribution. My aim is to maintain a focused and productive environment this year.

**Daily Chart Analysis: Key Levels and Targets**

Let's examine the daily chart. I've identified several key levels:

*   **High (Potential Target):** A potential target for today's trading.

*   **Highest Up Close Green Candle Closing Price:** This closing price acted as an intraday target.

*   **Wick Midpoint:** Splitting this wick in half reveals a target (consequent encroachment objective).

*   **Closing Price:** Classified as a rejection block.

*   **Fair Value Gap (FVG):**

    *   Defined by: drop down, this candle's low, this candle's high.
    *   Classification: Sell-side Imbalance Buy-Side Inefficiency (SIBI).
    *   The market traded up, leaving a small portion unfilled on Friday.
    *   We're now focusing back through this candle on Monday (today).

**Clarifying Methodology: Not Supply and Demand or Classic Support/Resistance**

I want to address a common misconception. Many people suggest that what I'm teaching is simply a re-labeled version of supply and demand.  It is **NOT** supply and demand or classic support/resistance.

*   **Supply and Demand vs. My Approach:**  Supply and demand practitioners often advocate for "fresh zones" and avoiding cutting through candles.  I *don't* adhere to that. I deal with specific levels and *do* cut through candles.
*   **Example:** I'm looking *past* this candle, focusing on a previous candle.
*   **Consequent Encroachment:** Midpoint of that candle is at 3982.5.

**PD Array (PDA) Matrix and Time Sensitivity**

I'm employing a look-back PD Array (PDA) matrix.  We're examining specific candles, looking back in time (20, 40, 60 days).

*   **Time Sensitivity:** Key levels are most sensitive within the last 20 days.  After 20 days, levels may still be respected, but I prioritize newer PD Arrays within that 20-day look-back window.
*   **Focus:**  The range of the last 20 days is my primary focus.
*   **Key Levels:**  Fair Value Gaps, Order Blocks, Breakers, Institutional Workflow Entry Drills, Consequent Encroachments, Mitigation Blocks, Rejection Blocks, old highs, and lows.
*   **Application:** These levels are salient to my preferred setups, which I look for in my specific markets (currently, the E-mini S&P).

**This Morning's Focus: Fair Value Gap Midpoint**

The midpoint of that Fair Value Gap was my primary focus this morning. I started the day by sharing a chart on Twitter.  You can find my *official* ICT Twitter account via a link on my YouTube channel's main page (upper right corner).  If you're not finding it through that link, you're likely following a fake account.

**Important Disclaimer:** I *will not* sell you anything, direct you to a Telegram channel, invite you to a Discord server, or use WhatsApp.

**Market Action vs. Expectations**

The plan was to see the market open, trade down to the level, and then rally up into the swing high. I anticipated this entire range would play out during the morning session, with consolidation during lunch, and then a run-up to the higher level in the afternoon session.  I intended to demonstrate this in the last hour, but the market completed the move *before* lunch.

We observed the market rally.  The key question was whether it possessed the momentum to breach these levels:

*   Fair Value Gap
*   High Consequent Encroachment
*   Rejection Block
*   Consequent Encroachment
*   Buy-Side Liquidity

Each time the market moved higher, the "thresholds" were assessed: was momentum strong enough to reach liquidity above? Last week, we observed a drop into the Fair Value Gap, followed by an energetic run on Friday, leaving a new Fair Value Gap. Today saw trading up into that gap, pushing through it, and ultimately reaching for buy-side liquidity.

**Intraday Charts and the "Power Three" Concept**

This logic guides my analysis of intraday charts. The surge above the 4035 level was significant.  This relates to my "Power Three" concept.

*   **Power Three:** I internalize the daily range, seeking expansion to liquidity or an imbalance above (if bullish) or expansion to the downside to an old low or imbalance (if bearish).

**Decision-Making: Bullish or Bearish, Inefficiency or Liquidity**

These are the two main decision points.

*   **Bullish Scenario:** If you're bullish, where is the market reaching?
    *   **Answer:** Either an inefficiency (Fair Value Gap) *or* liquidity above (old high, relative equal highs).
*   **Bearish Scenario:**  If you're bearish, where is the market reaching?
    *   **Answer:** Either an inefficiency (Fair Value Gap) or liquidity below (old low, relative equal lows).

**Algorithm:** The market is either bullish or bearish, and it targets either inefficiency or liquidity.

Once you determine the likely direction, you formulate a narrative. I use this mindset to anticipate the daily range and formulate engagements based on price action and PD Arrays on lower timeframes.

**Daily Chart Recap: Levels and Performance**

*   **Rejection Block:**  4055.25
*   **Old Low:** 4035.25
*   **Consequent Encroachment (Wick):** Market opened, traded down to it, and then expanded upwards, reaching the Rejection Block.

Admittedly, I didn't expect to see this entire move completed today.  I thought the 4055 level might be reached tomorrow or overnight. I would have mentioned this in today's commentary, but the market completed it all in one day.

**Hourly Chart Analysis: Buy-Side Liquidity and Consolidation**

The hourly chart reveals:

*   **Buy-Side Liquidity:** Relative equal highs.
*   **Market Behavior:** Consolidation, followed by a trade down to Smart Money Reversal Low Risk Buy Accumulation, with re-accumulation likely occurring within.

**Challenges and Missed Trades**

This area was tricky.  I mentioned this morning that there hadn't been much overnight movement, and I wanted to see trading between 2 AM and 9:30 AM (New York time). I was initially looking for a drop down into this area, but *not* to the 4050 level; I wanted it to reach 4035, taking out that quarterly level in the afternoon session. We had consolidated overnight and already ran above the short-term high of relative equal highs.

I was looking for a *deeper* run below that after 9:30 AM.  We'll examine this on lower timeframes shortly. However, the consolidation was too narrow, and the retracement below that low was too shallow.  This made it problematic for me to go long. Had there been a deeper drop before 9:30 AM, I would have been more aggressive in going long on the E-mini S&P. Because of the sideways consolidation and shallow drop, I didn't take *any* trades today. This is perfectly acceptable.

**Missing Trades: A Common Occurrence**

The key point is that my expectation hinged on a more substantial downward movement.

Students often ask about missing trades.  Do I miss trades? **YES!**  I miss *a lot* of trades. There are many trades I might see forming, but I'm not interested in pursuing them for various reasons:

*   Inability to manage the position.
*   Preoccupation with other matters.
*   Distractions (family, etc.).
*   Feeling unwell or tired.
*   Lack of interest (simply wanting to observe).

These are common challenges traders face that can prevent them from taking positions.

**Utilizing Twitter for Real-Time Analysis**

I was watching live today, mapping out and annotating the five- and one-minute charts, and sharing them on my Twitter feed. I encourage you to review those charts. You can overlay the links from those tweets onto your TradingView charts (one- or five-minute timeframe) to see exactly what I was observing and what the charts looked like from my perspective. This requires effort, and many might not want to do it, which is unfortunate because it's a valuable learning opportunity.

I'm doing this until our live sessions begin. Live sessions will be much more effective because you'll see me discussing specific things on the chart in real time, making communication easier and faster than posting charts on Twitter and waiting for delivery to your devices.

**Encouragement for Independent Study**

In the meantime, I encourage you to stay engaged, conduct your own studies, and mine these concepts from your charts.

**15-Minute Timeframe: Consolidation and Fair Value Gap**

Here is the 15-minute timeframe, stretched out for clarity. You can see the low and the Fair Value Gap.

*   **Fair Value Gaps:** This one and this one (shared on Twitter).
*   **Preference:** I favored this one.

The original consolidation, distribution, redistribution, smart money reversal, low-risk buy accumulation – somewhere within is going to be re-accumulation. I was looking for this to drop down for a second stage re-accumulation, so some kind of important low will form and I was willing to wait for it to drop down into this, I was preferring it to do that.

I was wanting this first, I favored this trading to first. Then using that as a springboard, running up into this area. I was wanting this first, I favored this trading to first, then using that as a springboard, running up into this area here. And then I would have been hopefully seeing it consolidate or retrace away from that going into lunch, noon hour to 1 o'clock, New York local time, and then resume going up for another leg higher.

The fact that it delivered all in one complete swing like that it was it was fun to watch, but it wasn't enough for me to participate in because they had already delivered the lion's portion of the move.

If you look at the 15-minute timeframe, I'm really zoomed in so you can really see the fair value, yeah. At 9:30, I wanted to see it Spike down into that, clear out the cell side here.

**Scenario that would make me take the trade**

I would have went along right in that stab of this Fairway gap on its own by itself. I would have done that I would have no fear in doing that because I felt strongly that that 40 35 and a quarter level was going to be targeted today and I wanted to see the initial objective this Fair Bay got here, which was 40 12 and I think it was in a quarter, so four zero one two point two five, but we'll just say four zero one two for the sake of argument.

And the market rallied, just kept pressing up into that after having a little bit of a sloppy open at 9:30. Ultimately different delivering up to the 40 55 and a quarter level, which is the old rejection block on the daily chart.

**Five Minute Chart Analysis: Buy Side, Sell Side, and Fair Value Gap**

Alright, on a five minute chart you can see we hit buy side here.

Retail Traders are going to see that as resistance so they'll think that it's safe to go short and their stop loss they'll use to protect their position while they're short we'll be placed right above here. Southside liquidity relatively equal to one another here. So cell size below there. So the market runs up takes buy side one more time punches it and drops all the way back down. And then this tiny little shallow run right below there that was enough to send it going the other direction.

Now, admittedly I was watching and we had our first snow, we didn't accumulate to anything, but it was beautiful seeing these big golf ball sized snowflakes falling down in Maryland out back of my house and I was watching this by set imbalance cell signing efficiency, which is a fair value Gap, but it's lacking what cell side delivery. So we see this Market drop down see this candle here. It's low is lower than this candle before it.

### E-mini S&P Analysis: Intraday Market Structure, Fair Value Gaps, and Algorithmic Macros

**Review of Previous Day's Analysis (Continued)**

We're picking up where we left off, continuing our deep dive into the E-mini S&P 500 analysis, focusing on intraday market structure, fair value gaps, and algorithmic macros.

**Institutional Referral Entry Drill and Fair Value Gaps**

*   **Setup:** The market formed a swing low inside a buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency after a shift in market structure, following a hunt of sell-side liquidity. This is an **Institutional Referral Entry Drill**.
*   **Rally and Imbalance:** The market rallies again, creating another imbalance, then drops back down into it.
*   **Stalling:** After creating this fair value gap, the market stalls.
*   **Expectation:** I wanted to see it go above that level and accumulate, building more of a support area, and then rise up to 4000.

**4000 Level and Volume Imbalance**

*   **4000 Achieved:** We reached 4000. I mentioned that on Twitter.
*   **Breakdown and Volume Imbalance:** The market broke down, and I had annotated this volume imbalance, wanting to see it support the price.
*   **Order Block as Last Line of Defense:** The order block was the last line of defense.
*   **Erosion:** The market kept eroding down into it.

**Post 9:30 AM Scenario and Missed Opportunity**

*   **Final Drop:** Post 9:30 AM, we had one more drop down into this Fair Value Gap.
*   **Preferred Scenario:** I wanted to see it go through here and then spike down to that level.
*   **Hourly and 15-Minute Timeframe Basis:** I was preferring that based on the hourly chart and the 15-minute timeframe, because that would have wiped out all the sell-side liquidity.
*   **Too Shallow:** This was too shallow for my personal tastes and never gave me the opportunity.
*   **No Opportunity, No Trade:** It just never given me the opportunity so we can be upset I could sit here and give you all kinds of complaints and such but you know I can find a trade every day it's not a big deal but the one I was really wanting was for it to trade down to there and that's what you're going to see sometimes when we're doing the live sessions I'll have a more preferred setup that I would rather get involved in the market with it may or may not give it to me if it doesn't I'll show you ways to still participate in the marketplace which is what I showed today and let's go into that now
*   **Preferred Setup:** I'll have a more preferred setup that I would rather get involved in the market with.
*   **Flexibility:** If it doesn't give it to me, I'll show you ways to still participate in the marketplace.

**"Red" Fair Value Gap (RFVG) and Inversion Level**

*   **Red Fair Value Gap:** This Gap in here, because I mentioned it on Twitter, is going to be referred to as the **red fair value Gap**.
*   **Bullish Scenario:** If I'm bullish, what I like to see is a PD array that fails and it becomes an **inversion level**.
*   **Up Close Candle:** We have this up close candle, the last up close candle in this swing high before taking out this low.

**Bullish Breaker**

*   **Identification:** That green candle is what I'm highlighting – that yellow rectangle one – that's a **bullish breaker**.
*   **Manipulation:** It trades above it, takes out liquidity, and then trades down below that low, taking out liquidity. This is a highly manipulated Market environment.
*   **Sloppy Market:** This is what I meant by saying it's sloppy. This could have very easily went into Seek and Destroy for the rest of the afternoon and never have gone above this high or below this low it just could have went back and forth chopping and taking out every little short-term high and low.
*   **Framework for Shift:** At this moment here I said it has the framework for the shift in Market structure here with the fair value Gap.

**Potential Scenarios and Commentary**

*   **Holding or Wilting:** If it's going to hold, it could have wilted and took out the 3984 and 3982 sell-side levels.
*   **Commentary:** I was commenting on that because that was what I was having in my mind as a potential scenario that I would prefer to see I wanted to see that and it was not willing to go lower and then finally went right back up into the breaker now
*   **Breaker Confirmation:** It was not willing to go lower and then finally went right back up into the breaker

**Breaker Re-Evaluation**

*   **Original Breaker:** I cut through candles so I'm going back to the original breaker here.
*   **Supplement:** This was a supplement on top of the breaker that originally was formed here. I'm going to go back to the original breaker when it happens there's logic right there
*   **Teaching Concepts:** I'm sorry but you folks that are trying to teach my Concepts you don't know what you're doing so please stop you don't know what you're doing and you're spreading misinformation and it's unfortunate because it isn't going to work the way you're doing it okay so it is what it is
*   **Breaker Range:** So we were back inside that range I don't need it to go above and come back down I can accumulate inside that breaker especially if if you look real close there's a small little Fair they got right in here
*   **Raid on Stops:** we went down and I mentioned this looks like it's a radon stops and the only thing I see now is a bullish breaker and a run to 40 12.

**4012 Target**

*   **Target Locked:** At this moment here I said it has the framework for the shift in Market structure here with the fair value Gap. And The only thing I see now is a bullish breaker and a run to 40 12
*   **Stop Run:** That was a stop on South Side there so back and forth in here we were collectively watching together and looking for a scenario and I was leading your attention to if we could run out 30 94 3982
*   **3982.50 Revisited:** because that would do what take us back down into 39.82 and a half which is the consequent encroachment midpoint of that gap on the daily chart
*   **Daily Chart Reference:** Remember how I first started this presentation I took your attention to the daily chart in a big long Wick below the daily candle and I split it in half and projected it forward and I was watching that level well it had already went down to 39.82 and a half you had done that but I want to see it do it one more time and take out liquidity a little bit more pronounced after the opening at 9 30 but the markets simply was not willing to present that and it was unwilling to go lower completely repriced all the way up to the top of the breaker perfect delivery perfect delivery

**"Perfect Delivery" and Red Fair Value Gap**

*   **Perfect Delivery:** The markets simply was not willing to present that and it was unwilling to go lower completely repriced all the way up to the top of the breaker perfect delivery perfect delivery
*   **Red Fair Value Gap Revisited:** then we went down into what boom there's that Gap that **red fair value Gap** if you look at my Twitter I'm cutting through candles folks okay I'm not supplying demand okay there's nothing like what I'm teaching you I do not ignore or forget about in imbalance once it's traded to and rebalanced that's logic that's narrative okay

**Algorithm and Imbalance Memory**

*   **Algorithm's Memory:** This point right here was before the 9 30 opening it was part of the narrative I was looking for I wanted to see this be reused in the future because the algorithm is going to remember this imbalance it's not going to look at this high and this low and say oh this no longer matters like anybody else that would be familiar with inefficiencies
*   **Algorithm Behavior:** so the algorithm is going right back into this the market drops down into that Fair there you go back handles high that right there is what I was referring to watch and see if it offers what support go back and look at the tweets folks that was not a Miss cue it was straight up right out of the logic I teach my students
*   **Support Confirmation:** I'm taking your attention to this Fair bag Gap and if it goes above it it comes back down and acts as support then we have a narrative that we can trust going forward
*   **4012 Target Reconfirmed:** so now we are now bullish looking for what the 4012 level

**Entry Pattern within the Breaker**

*   **Entry Pattern:** then we have to have an entry pattern right well we're inside of the breaker and then we have a fair value Gap right down here look at the bodies of the candle right there closing price Nails the high that's perfect it reshoots it a little bit that's fine because that's an over block down closed candle perfect delivery but that body stopping dead in its tracks inside that fair bag Gap right there and then off the races we go to 4012

**Fair Value Gap Confirmation**

*   **Resumption to 4012** so now we are now bullish looking for what the 4012 level then we have to have an entry pattern right well we're inside of the breaker and then we have a fair value Gap right down here look at the bodies of the candle right there closing price Nails the high that's perfect it reshoots it a little bit that's fine because that's an over block down closed candle perfect delivery but that body stopping dead in its tracks inside that fair bag Gap right there and then off the races we go to 4012

**Macro and Algorithmic Instructions**

*   **Algorithm Seeking:** see the fair value Gap here trades down until here accumulate reaccumulate sends it to the top of the Fairway gap on the 15 minute time frame to 40 17 50 and then back down to consequent encroachment which is the midpoint of that shaded red area it may not be red for you I'm I don't think it's pink maybe salmon colored I don't know but uh half of that Consolidated accumulated more rout outside of it here's that area here realize again consolidates that I mentioned as long as we remained above 40 12 that we would see 40 35 and a quarter the market rallied right up into that
*   **Tweet Confirmation:** and then I sent a tweet saying to screenshot your one minute chart as we delivered what we were looking for the market pressed on into 40 51 it retraced Consolidated dropped back down into that old 40 35.25 level it's an old daily High consolidated

**Lunch Hour Consolidation**

*   **Lunch Hour Consolidation:** and here we have the lunch hour between noon and one o'clock in the afternoon now I'm seeing some folks they're warming up the idea that the markets are algorithmic that's wonderful but they are sometimes saying that algorithms don't go out for lunch they don't take lunch um the algorithm doesn't take a bunch but the algorithm reflects on price action inside the lunch hour and there is a consolidation most times in the hour between noon and one o'clock that's what we're seeing here
*   **Lunch Hour Lows as Targets:** we get a retracement or reversal in the afternoon session it's going to aim for the lows formed during the lunch hour

**Afternoon Session Model (2022)**

*   **PM Session Targets:** then I'm going to be watching for a potential reversal this swing low gets broken there that's in a potential reversal expect this to sell off aggressively and then go back through the Gap that forms at the old high
*   **High Probability Selloff:** if you get this breakthrough here the very next selling opportunity you want to use that because this is going to be a very sudden breakdown of a market maker Selma and it's going to aggressively reach for in this case the lunch hour lows here for sell stops
*   **Sell Model activated:** Then Meltdown through That Fairway guy it does it here and watch what happens it goes right back up to it there that's your sword that's short right there you put your stop loss right above the high of the Fairway Gap that's formed here this one extend it in time that right there is what the algorithm is going to refer to that one the sphere value Gap right there and you want to see it leave some of that open like it does and the next candle look what it does boom undeniable

**Twitter Confirmation and Algorithm Behavior**

*   **Twitter Proof:** undeniable now some of you are going to think there's no way this is a hindsight go on my Twitter go on my Twitter and I had it mapped out right before it reverses and then I took you down into a 15 second chart looking for 40 38 liquidity and boom it hits it and everybody else knew exactly what to expect next which was the 40 35 quarter level to be traded back to
*   **Lunch Hour Lows Targeted:** But some of you forgot that that's the launch hour sells on liquidity which is exactly what I taught how to trade the PM session in the 2022 model on this YouTube channel targeting there's lunch hour Lowe's when you're bearish

**One-Minute Chart Analysis**

*   **If you have a gap at the old High breaks above drops down you long right there you can put a limit order right this candles below one tick below it will fill you rallies down close candle touches it here you would expect as your watching price real time it opens here drops down until it hits it perfectly that opening price that's my order block and then you watch and see does it reach for the rejection block it does and through it five handles look for a shift in Market structure there if it gives you a selling opportunity and then takes out that fair value you got at the old High once it does it here as soon as it returns back the battery you got that's the next cell elevators going down and it wilted from there**
*   **Algorithm Macro:** There are lots of these types of macros in my algorithm they happen at specific times certain times of the day and this one here is the two o'clock macro if you have a high that runs to a higher time frame and you have an imbalance in here the imbalance once it's treated through it becomes an inversion level just like the red fair value Gap I gave you this morning on Twitter it became an inversion level this should have been what support it does once it trades through it it now becomes what resistance it's not supply and demand it's not classic support resistance okay it's completely algorithmic and you cannot arm wrestle it it is what it is it's not in other books and if you can find it in other books find it tell me what book it is and tweet it to me and I'll retweet it if it's in there but it ain't going to be retweeted because it's not in there until next time be safe

**Algorithmic Inversion Levels and Conclusion**

*   **Inversion Level Defined:** The imbalance, once it's traded through, becomes an **inversion level**. Just like the **red fair value Gap** I gave you this morning on Twitter, it became an inversion level. This *should* have been support. It does, once it trades through it, it *now* becomes resistance.
*   **Algorithmic, Not Conventional:** It's not supply and demand. It's not classic support/resistance. It's completely algorithmic, and you cannot arm wrestle it. It is what it is. It's not in other books
*   **Closing Remarks:** until next time be safe

# Market Analysis - January 30, 2023

**Video URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrZJmwrMxFY

## Introduction

Good evening, folks. I had some technical difficulties with Camtasia earlier, wasting an hour and 20 minutes on failed recordings. Therefore, I don't have time for a Twitter space tonight, so I’ll try to cover everything here. I hope this will suffice.

## Upside Levels Mentioned on Friday

I mentioned on Friday that there were several upside levels I was watching if the market continued to rise.

*   **Initial High:** 4090.75
*   **Consequent Encroachment:** This was based on the daily chart from December 13th.

To understand the levels, a Fibonacci retracement was used, measuring from the initial high to the consequent encroachment.

*   **Fibonacci Level:** 4104.25

Further Levels:
    *   **Midpoint:** Halfway between levels.
    *   **Consequent Encroachment Level:** Further up from the midpoint.

After establishing the high, low, and midpoint, these additional levels were determined:

*   **25%**
*   **50%**
*   **75%**
*   **Terminus**

*Note:* Don’t worry if this is confusing now, as these concepts will be revisited throughout the year.

## Pre-Market Analysis on Twitter (January 30, 2023)

I posted a pre-market analysis video on Twitter around 8:15-8:25 AM New York time today (January 30, 2023). You can find this on my Twitter feed.

*   The analysis outlined everything discussed here *before* the market opened.

*Note:* This analysis covered the New Week Opening Gap. I will spare you the details here, but it is available on Twitter.

The market was trading around 4052 in the pre-market. It's important to consider both regular trading hours (RTH) and electronic trading hours (ETH) to identify gaps that might be missed when using only ETH. Use both to find them. The procedure is not always necessary, but sometimes it is. Come every day show up with a notepad and you'll learn more more things.

## Daily Chart Analysis and Order Block

The market traded up into the New Week Opening Gap later in the morning. The level is also an order block from the daily chart.

*   **Order Block:** The high of the candle from January 25th.
    *   **Level:** 4040.50

This level is also the low of the fair value gap between the low of the candle on January 27th (Friday) and the high of the single candle on Thursday of last week.

**Reaction to Order Block (15-Minute Time Frame)**

The market reacted to the daily chart order block.

*   Price dipped only one-quarter of a point below it (4040.00 low vs. 4040.50 level).

The reaction sent the price higher, trading up into the described level.

## 5-Minute Chart and Fair Value Gap

There is a Fair Value Gap on the 5-minute chart, which I mentioned this morning.

*   **Purpose:** This will serve as an upside draw.
*   If bullish, look for these levels to act as support after the price moves above them.

The levels were already annotated in the chart but were made darker for better visibility on Twitter. The idea was to see the market go higher, which I outlined with supporting logic this morning.

**Soft Bias**

The analysis was based on a "soft bias," relying primarily on technicals rather than economic news or volatility injections. This means waiting until closer to the 9:30 AM equities opening in New York to see how the market will behave.

## 1-Minute Chart Analysis

Okay, let's get to the point and move on.

*   **Relative Equal Lows:** Notice the lows here.
*   **Fair Value Gap:** Noted because it took out a short-term high, creating a shift in market structure that is bullish.

**Why Expect Bullish Movement?**

Because of my analysis this morning, which indicated a likely move back to the New Week Opening Gap. That's the draw on liquidity that I'll be teaching live this year so you can understand it and be able to determine where the market's going.

**Key Concepts**

*   **Low Taken Out:** Price shifted above the high.
    *   Market structure is bullish.
*   **Fair Value Gap:** Yes, it trades down to halfway, which is the consequent encouragement of the gap.
*   **Bullish Order Block:** Three seconds of down closed candles which is also the midpoint of that gap. The gap is defined by this candles low and this candles high.
*   **Volume Imbalance:** Small volume imbalance after market rallies.
*   **Propulsion Block:** A down-closed candle that approaches a previous order block that's lower.

I like to see no more than half of that candle traded to, which we see occurring here (watch the bodies). Expect a return back to this midpoint. The precision here is algorithmic. If you apply how I look at price this year, you're never going to look at a Candlestick chart ever again. You're not even going to reach for a bull flag or head and shoulders pattern. You're going to focus in on the Open, High, Low, and Close and time.

**Approaching Equities Opening**

*   **Relative Equal Highs:** Above that is buy-side liquidity.
*   **Orange Levels:** These represent a 5-minute Fair Value Gap. We want to see price trade through that if we are bullish.

It acts as a speed bump but not a barrier or brick wall. We see consolidation, a rally above, and then a return back to what is considered a breaker.

*   **Breaker:** Up-close candle inside the swing high between the low and the lower low. (All taught in my channel).

## Accumulating Long Positions

Find the midpoint of the breaker. That is the mean threshold, it trades down into it here and I'm accumulating long positions here within this volume imbalance as well. Watch me do this in the morning recording where I was healing my long positions here talking about how it can go down to consequent encroachment midpoint here that that's permissible.

Later in the day, the market moved into a target called in the pre-market analysis.

## Further Analysis and Observations

The market moved higher, respecting the Fair Value Gap.

*   **Buy-Side of Balance, Sell-Side Inefficiency (Not a Liquidity Void):** This is *not* a liquidity void.
*   **Liquidity Void:** A gap between one candle's high (and closing price being the same) and another candle's low (and opening being the same), with no price touching or overlapping.

**Difference Between Volume Imbalance and Liquidity Void**

*   **Volume Imbalance:** Range between one candle's body and another candle's body not touching, but with wicks overlapping.

Therefore, we are looking for a buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency, and consequent encroachment. Crossovers and moving averages aren't necessary. We're just looking for areas where the market will pull back into an inefficiency or run stops and then go to a level to fill an inefficiency or run stops. Determine the bias first and look for the parameters.

**Additional Examples**

*   The market rallies up, thoughts on a balance outside efficiency again much like this one here trades down to the last Clan candle here which is the bull shoulder block there perfectly. The opening price on that candle four zero five eight point five zero. The low on this candle here 405 8.50 perfect.

*   Rise Again buy Center belts outside efficiency. What's this candle here bull shoulder block. What's the high that candle right there four zero six one point seven five.

*   There is a gap here that shaded area and it can return back to consequent encroachment midpoint.

The narrative is told to you by the bodies.

*   **High of Back Candle:** 4061.75
*   **Close of that Candle:** 4061.75

Perfect that's algorithmic. The market rallies.

## Investigating Friday's Close and Sunday's Opening

If you look at how we went back up into Friday's close, which is this here 84 even.

*   Closing Price: 4084.00
*   Sunday's Opening: Down below

This is the opening gap on Sunday. We went up to it, filled it in, and came back down. Now we have redelivered to this range between Friday's close and Sunday's opening. We delivered buy side and then sell side.

*   Balanced Price Range: Not yet, it needs to leave it.

It rallies back up to where consequent encroaching midpoint, then it leaves it. When it leaves, it leaves a weak Fair Value Gap.

*   This Level is Important: I said this morning that it could return back to this weekly gap opening. It does not need to come back to Friday's closer up here because of what I just outlined here.

**Summary**

It opened here on Sunday, traded back out to Friday's close, delivered buy side, then sell side, then halfway, fails to go higher, and leaves the range. The only inefficiency left is the small Fair Value Gap. Now scrub on over here and look how perfect that is.

## Exiting Trades

I didn't get a perfect exit. That's my weak point in my trading. The high was 4078 even, and I only got out at 4076 and a quarter and I wasn't even able to time it where I can get out in between the Gap. So I'm doing two points to a level I was calling for to a bias based on everything techno that I've outlined. Everything was just beautiful today.

## Final Remarks

I apologize for being unorganized I'm usually much more organized and I just want to get through because I'm kind of tired.

We had this low here prior


Okay, here is the reorganized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining all original details, context, and nuances.

## Further Breakdown of Market Movements

### Sell-Side Liquidity and Daily Order Block

Prior to the upward movement, there was a low. Below that low resides sell-side liquidity. This is because of the reaction off of the daily order block. Remember that this level also represents the low of the daily fair value gap.

*Note:* If you are a new viewer and these concepts are moving quickly, please revisit the video. I outline what this level represents on the daily chart.

### Initial Reaction and Subsequent Breakdown

The first time price hits this level, it rallies away and moves precisely to the level I outlined this morning. At this point, many retail traders might expect continued upward movement. However, I was not anticipating further gains.

The market then begins to break down, moving below the fair value gap on the 5-minute chart.

*   This gap now acts as resistance.
*   Price wicks through it slightly into an order block.
*   Price breaks lower again.
*   The bodies of the candles begin to respect the fair value gap.

Therefore, if price returns, we can reasonably expect it to target the low and, potentially, the half-point consequent encroachment. The bodies of the candles confirm this.

*Note:* The precision with which the algorithm appears to create turning points, contradicting the idea that retail traders, through some collective effort, dictate market movements. There are deeper, more technical forces at play.

### Algorithmic Control vs. Retail Trading

There are much deeper forces in price action than bull flags, head and shoulders patterns, Elliott wave theory, and harmonic patterns. There's a real technical science to this, whether or not institutions admit it. This is algorithmic and controlled to a high degree.

### Balanced Price Range and Time of Day

Price breaks lower, creating a rally. What time of day does it rally? 1:15 PM.

*   This is a little early for my liking; I prefer 2:00 PM for the afternoon move.

We have a balanced price range, with one rally upward and one rally downward within a small area. This creates a fair value on both sides, making it difficult for the price to move through.

### Targeting Sell-Side Liquidity

The sell-side is located below the relative equal lows and below that specific low.

### Shoutout to Patrick Wieland

Shoutout to Patrick Wieland. He calls his own moves and puts in work every day. Another YouTuber I like and recommend checking out. Please don't go there and talk about me. He’s putting his time and energy into trying to show you how to do this stuff his way, and that's cool.

### 4045 Target and Market Breakdown

I posted that 4045 was my target for the afternoon. When the market is below the Fair Value Gap it's going to be acting as resistance. So when it hits the 4058 level, it starts to break down, and we're going to be looking for 4045, and 4045 was nailed. It ran up into a fair value gap and broke down to relative equal lows and a balanced price range.

### The Importance of Live Analysis

Trust me, you'll hear more about this all year long, and it'll make more sense to you seeing it live, called, and explained that way. If I can't do it live, it's going to be of no use. That's the whole reason why I come out here this year, so that way you can see it. I can walk you through it, give you a better understanding that way you can see there's no cherry-picking.

### Market Manipulation and Fund Orders

The balanced price range is in place, and then it's going to attack that low right there.

*   Why? Because this is where the majority of the move this morning started.
*   Traders at a fund level will have their orders down here.

### Sell Stops and Fund Management

They're going to have sell stops because they're not in the habit of running up and trailing their stop loss because they're trying to catch more sizable moves. You'd be surprised how a lot of fund managers don't know what the hell they're doing. Just because they're running a fund doesn't mean they're profitable or know what to do. But they have a lot of money behind it. That's where the market's going to go, where the money is, where are the orders.

### Focus on Profits, Not Patterns

Forget about harmonic crab patterns and Elliott wave counts. You don't need to count anything; just count your profits. That's all you got to worry about. Show up every single day with a notepad, and I promise I will deposit more understanding in you than you'll get from any other books out there that talk about technical analysis.

### Learning Technical Analysis

And I promise I'm going to do it in such a way where it will be fun, it'll be engaging, you'll have drills, homework that you'll *want* to do (not like when you were in school), and you'll feel better about what you've learned at the end of the week. It'll be so much more understanding that you don't even really understand what you're going to see, but I know, and I can't wait to share it with you.

### Closing Remarks

Hopefully, you found something insightful. Hopefully, I didn't run through it too quickly. I know I'm usually long-winded and go into a lot more detail, but I'm tired, so I gotta get some rest. Otherwise, I won't be the same on Twitter tomorrow. Until next time.

# Trading Session Analysis: Market Maker Buy Model & New Week Opening Gap

**Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqOVbd1oqZk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqOVbd1oqZk)

## Initial Trade Setup

*   Attempted to record earlier but missed the office.
*   **Trade initiated on phone** using an **order block**.
*   **Trading premise:** Market Maker Buy Model, anticipating price moving up into the **New Week Opening Gap**.
    *   Mentioned this expectation earlier that morning on Twitter.

### Addressing Potential Misinterpretations

*   **Shaded area isn't a breaker; it's a "speed bump."**
*   Most traders applying a "**rip-off edition of Smart Money Concepts**" would likely view it as a sell. This is incorrect.
*   **Anticipated price is drawn to buy-side liquidity.**
*   Identified another block.

### Early Annotations & Expectations

*   Began notating the chart, anticipating a drop to a specific level.
*   **Target:** Digging down into a down-close candle.
    *   Highlighted candle and prepared to trade down to its midpoint (**mean threshold**).

## Position Adjustments & Initial Profit-Taking

*   Added five more contracts.
*   **Expectation:** Rapid move to take out the high of the day.
    *   Noted location with a summary code.
*   Desired a significant expansion of price with speed and initiated plans to move the stop to break even.
*   **"I'm on side"**: Implies high confidence in the trade's direction, anticipating aggressive trading to the buy-side and into the New Week Opening Gap.
    *   The shaded orange area might not make sense without following the Twitter commentary from earlier that day.

## Key Price Points & Reactions

*   **Most recent down-closed candle:** Sensitivity between the high and open of that candle.
*   Declined to add more to the position.
*   **Reacted off the order block** as predicted, moving rapidly into the buy-side liquidity.
*   Everything proceeding according to the plan.
*   Anticipated drop to **4076.75:** the low end of the New Week Opening Gap.

### Defining the New Week Opening Gap

*   The gap between Friday's close and Sunday's opening price.
*   Wanted to see expansion into the shaded area.

## Consequent Encroachment & Scaling Out

*   Tapped into buy-side liquidity; pullback possible.
*   A small fair value gap had just formed contingent on candle closure.
*   **Consequent encroachment:** Measuring from two candles back on the left.
*   **Plan:** Take off 80% of the position (20 contracts).
    *   Primary focus remains on the stated objectives.
    *   Expectation is that the price will target the high end of the New Week Opening Gap.

## Understanding Market Narrative

*   Short-term highs broken to the upside.
*   Bought into the first down-closed candle as it was moving down.
*   **Order block**: Touched it again later but no further additions made.
*   Approaching the New Week Opening Gap.
*   **Understanding the narrative**: Prevents misinterpreting PD arrays (Pricing Delivery Arrays).
    *   **Caution**: Concepts in the hands of the inexperienced or malicious can be harmful due to misapplication and cherry-picking.

## Approaching the Target & Momentum

*   **New Week Opening Gap reached:** A pullback into the fair value gap below is possible.
*   Desired immediate rejection and continuation higher.
*   **Potential Misunderstanding**: Without understanding the underlying concepts, the pink shaded area could be wrongly interpreted as a bearish breaker, potentially leading to incorrect trading decisions.
*   Importance of understanding the concepts before applying them, to avoid harming yourself or others through ignorance.
*   Now focused on the **consequent encroachment**, defined as the midpoint of a gap or any inefficiency, abbreviated as **C.E.** on the charts.
*   Expecting significant momentum out of that fair value gap.

## Execution & Securing Profit

*   Successfully peeled off 20 contracts upon reaching the consequent encroachment level.
*   Moved the stop loss up to lock in a $2000 profit.
*   Now evaluating the remaining portion of the potential move.

### Watching for Support & Reaccumulation

*   Observing if support is found without breaking below the lower quarter of the consequent encroachment down to the low of the shaded area.
*   Hoping to see reaccumulation and further expansion.
*   Stop is admittedly close but justifiable given the upcoming FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) event, which can introduce volatility.
*   New Target: The top of the New Week Opening Gap (the Shaded Area).

## Peeling Off Remaining Contracts

*   The 80% partial execution has already been annotated on the chart.
*   Dropping contract selection to one to scale out more precisely.
*   Actively monitoring relative equal highs on the one-minute chart.
*   **Strategy**: Selling one contract immediately after a new candle prints slightly above the relative equal highs.
*   **Running down equity**: Taking partial profits into a sustained move.

### Managing Expectations & Waiting

*   Acknowledged missing an earlier opportunity but remaining patient and confident in the continued run to the top of the New Week Opening Gap.
*   **Waiting for a higher high**: To then sell one contract at market of the five remaining.
*   Further scaling out planned halfway between the current price and the top of the shaded area, approximately.

## Final Contracts & Stop Loss

*   Three contracts remaining.
*   Peeling off a contract at the top of the range.
*   Rolling the stop loss on the final balance.
*   Beautiful price run.

## Trade Conclusion

*   Stop loss triggered.
*   Showing executions (not a market replay).
*   Hope the analysis was insightful.
*   Until next time, be safe.

# FOMC Trading Analysis and Observations

## Introduction

*   **Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVxC7UAHzwk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVxC7UAHzwk)
*   "Thank you," not sure if the audio is working yet.
*   Apologies for a delay that couldn't be overcome.
*   This FOMC analysis will be a **monthly occurrence** throughout the year.
*   The goal is to illustrate *why trading these events is generally discouraged*, despite occasional lucky outcomes.
*   The focus is on providing educational content.

## Initial Market Observation (Pre-FOMC Release)

*   **Focusing on the 4091.25 level.**
*   Uncertainty about market direction: "Do we run through that, reject it, and trade back lower? I don't know."
*   Waiting for the official release at **2:00 PM**; the initial move is often misleading.
*   Anticipating the **"real move"** around **2:30 PM**.
*   Describing it as a **"tsunami type effect."**
*   Observing the market and highlighting noteworthy points.
*   The 4091.25 level is considered **"too smooth"** and suspect.
*   Emphasis against gambling or "action hound" trading.

## Initial Reaction to the Release

*   Volatility expected to increase momentarily.
*   **Initial reaction: Sell-side attacked first.**
*   Interesting observation: The initial high wasn't taken out.
*   The high is the consequent encroachment of the new week opening gap.
*   Equal highs present at **4091.25.**
*   Observing how buy-side engages these levels.
*   No immediate tradeable setups.
*   Observing liquidity and market behavior around it.
*   Watching for a swipe above **4092.**
*   Discouragement from impulsive trading.

## General Trading Rule and Philosophy

*   "Don't touch it now."
*   This is a general rule, not specific to this day.
*   Students are generally advised to avoid trading during these events.
*   Admitting to having traded after **2:45 PM New York local time** in the past, but rarely.
*   Trading before knowing the outcome is considered a gamble with low odds.
*   Emphasis on letting the market play out and observing the two-stage event (2:00 PM and 2:30 PM).
*   Plan to observe the market until **3:00 PM.**

## Market Dynamics and Liquidity

*   The market tried to go lower, returning inside the pre-2:00 PM range.
*   Sell-side liquidity was taken.
*   Watching the current level and the larger pool of liquidity above.
*   Benefit of this analysis (even without trading): Understanding how the market seeks liquidity.
*   Current market has no major inefficiencies, except the price action above.
*   Need to understand buying and selling signals before engaging.
*   The market moved about 20-25 handles from the high with no follow-through.
*   Calling current trading a "gamble".
*   Smaller PD array (Premium Discount Array) levels are not significant now.

## Annotating Efficiency and Potential Scenarios

*   Annotating efficiency using trend lines.
*   Observing relatively equal highs indicating resting buy-side liquidity.
*   These highs are considered "too smooth".
*   The market might reach for buy-side liquidity above this level.
*   Hypothetical case study, not a trade recommendation.
*   Building a case for what might be in play at **2:30 PM**.
*   If the market goes above those highs, it's likely to go to **4092** to clear the initial high.
*   If it goes above that, potential target is at consequent encroachment.

## Market Behavior

*   Buy-side liquidity has been purged.
*   The market moved right up into the midpoint (consequent encroachment).
*   Not enough justification for a major FOMC move yet.
*   Observing whether the market has enough energy to reach through the higher end of the sphere.
*   The mentioned gap is a **"SIBI" (Sell-side Imbalance Buy-side Inefficiency).**
*   It means the candle was a delivery on the downside offering sell-side.
*   The way it's being re-priced may suggest it to go to the top of that level.
*   That has happened, which means the level is repriced, not rebalanced.
*   Repricing has happened but not rebalancing.
*   It's not balanced, needs to leave the range, try to go to it, then go lower OR go above it, come back down, then rally.

## Expectations and Trade Ideas

*   Looking at a high where retail traders are positioned for a lower move.
*   The default mindset is to attack them.
*   Want to see aggressive move above this high into the higher levels, then into **4092**.
*   The reason being: the market repeatedly traded below old lows, which implies a run above old highs.
*   There were several old lows broken.
*   Mentioned going into a previous inefficiency's midpoint.

## Market Willingness

*   Observation of the market trading away from a level and returning.
*   Need to see a willingness not to go back inside two blue lines.
*   **2:30 PM is the real move.**
*   Thinking out loud over the charts.
*   **This type of analysis will happen twice a week.**

## Disclaimers and Warnings

*   Do not take this as an invitation to trade.
*   If confidence was high, one would be trading live instead of commentating.
*   Still leaning towards the buy-side.
*   Watching how the market trades after this high and 4092 is traded to.
*   Does it explode through it and trade into the 4100 level?
*   Observing the current area, it looks "too clean."
*   Previous low piercing suggests potential upward momentum.
*   The first part of FOMC had full repricing to inefficiency and consequent encroachment.

## General Advice and Closing Thoughts

*   Any stalling shouldn't be trusted.
*   **Why students are told not to trade it: Unseasoned traders are prone to impulsivity.**
*   This is not the time to "see what happens" because it's usually painful.
*   Stop-loss may not be effective in volatile environments.
*   Addressing "wise guys" who claim to trade FOMC successfully despite recommendations.
*   Encouraging new traders to engage in such environments is irresponsible.
*   Equivalent to trading on non-farm payroll day.
*   Real move begins in about 15 minutes.
*   **The 2:30 PM move brings the real motion.**
*   Remembered a bearish breaker review.
*   Removed the bearish breaker from the screen.
*   Watch how the market responds and respects this specific area here
*   About pyramiding.
*   PD array, premium discount array.
*   Consequent encroachment is the midpoint of an inefficiency and or a gap.
*   The mood is about to change.
*   Favoring this area to be engaged.
*   If you make money on this please don't tweet it, it'll be considered luck.
*   Events like this are a case study to observe what price wants to do next and where it has been.
*   The market is providing a reason for traders to trust those levels as what resistance.
*   When it looks like that, it looks like Candyland where the retail mindset is.
*   Might be wrong, it could completely cascade and go lower and it's no harm.
*   This is not the environment to push the button, but one to learn how to read.


Here is the reorganized and enhanced version of the provided text:

# FOMC and Market Analysis: Priming, Liquidity, and Manipulation

## Introduction and Overview

*   This analysis will be conducted for every **FOMC** and **Non-Farm Payroll** release this year, providing an immersive learning experience.
*   The primary focus is on understanding market dynamics, not encouraging trading during these volatile events.
*   Levels to watch: **4089.75** and **4091.25**.

## Market Priming and Retail Trader Psychology

*   **Priming** is defined as inducing a specific mindset, in this case, the belief that certain levels offer reliable resistance.
*   The presenter believes that the **4089.75** and **4091.25** levels are being used to prime retail traders into taking short positions.
*   The common thought process of inexperienced traders: "The market bounced down from these levels, so I can go short with a stop-loss above 4091.25."
*   The expectation is that these traders will be "vanquished" when the **FOMC** release occurs.

## Trading Philosophy and Risk Management

*   **Disclaimer:** This is a learning exercise, not a trade recommendation.
*   Getting the analysis wrong is beneficial for students, provided they study the actual outcome.
*   Avoid fixating on hypothetical profits or losses; this is detrimental.
*   Trading **FOMC** is likened to a "carnival ride" with unpredictable movements.
*   The recommendation is to wait until **2:45 PM** (New York time) or the last hour of trading before engaging.
*   Emphasis on selective trading and avoiding high-risk situations.
*   **FOMC** and similar events carry a greater degree of risk than regular trading days or even high-impact news events (excluding CPI).

## Current Market Bias and Potential Manipulation

*   The presenter is currently "co-signing" the idea that the market will run above the **4091.25** level.
*   Being wrong is acceptable and serves as a teaching moment, reinforcing the dangers of trading these events.
*   The goal is to be a mentor who advises against unnecessary risk.

## Watching Key Levels and Market Sensitivity

*   Focus on the midpoint of a specific wick to gauge potential support.
*   Observing if the price shows sensitivity at this level and wants to move higher.
*   In the next few minutes, many retail traders may regret their decisions.
*   Some traders may mistakenly believe they are skilled if they get lucky.

## Hypothetical Market Manipulation Scenario

*   If controlling the market, the presenter would:
    *   Run the price through the current highs.
    *   Take it up to around **4108-4112** (potentially **4115**).
    *   Then "crash" it back down.
*   This scenario is based on the idea of inflicting maximum damage to the most vulnerable traders.

## Identifying Vulnerable Traders and Liquidity Pools

*   Sell stops have already been taken out, neutralizing traders who were short with tight stop losses.
*   Traders who are currently short, believing in the recent downward move, are now vulnerable.
*   The hypothetical manipulation would involve clearing out these shorts and trapping buyers before reversing the price.
*   The presenter acknowledges this may not happen but enjoys studying how market makers operate.
*   Lack of insight into the "game plan" used on these days is a primary reason for avoiding trading.

## Pre-Release Market Observations

*   Watching the price action around a specific wick.
*   Determining if the market will slightly break below it and then rally, or aggressively move into the "Pi 7 imbalance sell-side inefficiency" (referring to a specific candle).
*   No entries are being considered at this time.

## Potential "Maximum Carnage" Scenario

*   The presenter is considering why the market might want to move lower.
*   If traders are long, anticipating a move to **4100**, the market could profit by knocking them out.
*   The move would entail pushing the price down into an imbalance, then aggressively reversing it, causing maximum damage.

## Key Levels and Confirmation Signals

*   Looking for aggressive movement through a small gap.
*   If the market moves above a certain level, then comes back down and uses it as support, a violent move to take out **4092** is expected.

## Market Sentiment and Liquidity

*   The market is potentially allowing shorts to feel safe.
*   Remember the stop-losses above **4092** and **4089.75.**
*   A move to **4089.75** would likely trigger a quick run to **4092**.
*   Observation of how the market trades through a gap, then expands upward.

## Unfinished Business and Breaker Pattern

*   The high and the **4092.25** level represent "unfinished business."
*   Anticipating a rip through these levels.
*   Identifying a potential breaker pattern (low, high, lower low) that could accumulate more longs.

## Real-Time Market Commentary and Targets

*   **4092** has been hit.
*   Speculating on whether the market will now move to **4108** or **4100.**
*   If this were a normal trading day, the presenter would be taking profits and tightening stop losses.
*   Targets of **4108** and **4112** are considered achievable.
*   If those targets are hit, the charts would be closed, considering the day a success.

## Post-Target Analysis and Observations

*   Noting that the market is creating new bull flags and trend lines.
*   Price action is approaching the **4108** target.
*   Even when expecting to be wrong, the presenter is still able to accurately predict market movements.

## Target Achieved and Trade Closure

*   The market has hit **4112**, signaling the end of the trading session.
*   The presenter did not take any trades but outlined potential scenarios and explained market behavior.
*   Anyone who followed the analysis and is currently long should exit their positions.

## Potential Further Targets

*   Suggesting placing horizontal lines at **4115** and **4125** as potential further targets, though the market may not reach them.
*   The primary target of **4108-4112**, based on the fair value gap analysis, has been achieved.

## Conclusion and Future Plans

*   This type of live analysis will be conducted twice a week.
*   The goal is to help viewers understand price action and market dynamics without necessarily trading.
*   Viewers are encouraged to provide feedback on Twitter.
*   The presenter hopes the analysis was helpful and encourages viewers to be safe.

# Price Action Chronicles - Day 1: Market Analysis and Expectations

## Introduction
Video URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALMsQytQ1fg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALMsQytQ1fg)

Good morning everyone. Today marks the start of my Price Action Chronicles. I will begin with a review of the current market position relative to past performance, followed by my analysis for the E30 and expectations for 9:30.

I'll be showing raw charts to make my analysis transparent.

## 1. Dollar Index Analysis

### Rationale
My analysis always begins with the Dollar Index. Why? Because it acts as a **risk-on/risk-off barometer**. It indicates:

*   Likelihood of continued upside (going long) in ES (E-mini S&P 500 futures).
*   Likelihood of continued weakness in ES.
*   Potential for consolidation or choppiness, leading to lower participation.

When facing conflicting analysis, I reduce risk and focus on small, intraday scalps instead of targeting larger moves.

### Application
I use this indicator across various markets:

*   Forex
*   Bonds
*   Equities and Index Futures

### Risk Framing
The Dollar Index frames the logic for whether to assume risk:

*   **Risk-on:** Buying foreign currencies or stocks (lower dollar expected).
*   **Risk-off:** Avoiding risky assets (higher dollar expected).

### Early Year Expectations
At the beginning of the year, I was looking for a lower dollar. Refer back to:

*   Analysis videos on my YouTube channel.
*   Commentary and tweets on my Twitter account.

*Important Note:* Everything discussed here was communicated beforehand. This is to benchmark where we were, where we are now, and where we are likely to go.

### Key Observations and Price Action

*   **Target:** Lower prices and sell-side liquidity.
*   Sell-side liquidity was successfully tagged.
*   **Potential Support Zone:** Below the sell-side liquidity lies an order block and a fair value gap.
    *   **Order Block:** The down-closed candle. It's an order block because price moved away from it after the gap.
    *   **Fair Value Gap:** Indicated by the range.
*   **Possible Reaction:** If price retraces back into this candle, we should see a reaction. This doesn't guarantee an ultimate low, but indicates a strong draw when price is above it.
*   Earlier this year, price moved lower, and the fair value gap acted as resistance.

### ICT Concepts: Simplicity in Understanding
Many people view ICT (Inner Circle Trader) concepts as complicated. However, I aim to provide a deep but simple understanding of price action:

*   **Price Direction:** Is price going higher or lower?
    *   **Higher:** Targeting an old swing high or relative equal highs (buy-side liquidity).
    *   **Lower:** Targeting a single swing low or relative equal lows (sell-side liquidity).
*   **Imbalances:** If bullish with an imbalance (e.g., this and that), or bearish (as I was initially), price will draw to those levels.

### Fair Value Gaps and Order Blocks: Detailed Examination
I identified two points of interest:

*   Sell-side liquidity.
*   Potential dig into the imbalance and order block once sell-side liquidity was broken.

Specifically, price went to the **midpoint (consequent encroachment)** of the gap.

Whenever there's an imbalance:

*   **Buy-Side Imbalance Sell-Side Inefficiency (BISI):** A fair value gap category.
    *   This is a concept frequently used and annotated by myself and my students.
    *   It consists of three levels, **NOT supply and demand:**
        1.  **Actual High:** Framed by the candle's low.
        2.  **Middle (Consequent Encroachment):**
        3.  **Low:** Least likely price objective.
        *   The two primary levels are the high of the gap and the midpoint.
*   We observed a reaction at the midpoint.
*   Last week, I was framing shorts on the S&P as we traded into this imbalance.

### Current Market Position and 9:30 Expectations

*   The market has already posted a risk-off scenario with the dollar rising.
*   This suggests potential weakness in foreign currencies and equities.
*   **Shorting Opportunities:** If S&P charts show a potential low resistance liquidity run.

*Important Note:* I'm not providing specific predictions for 9:30; I need to see the market's behavior at that time. The goal is to understand the procedures to follow and what to focus on independently.

### Learning Objectives
Throughout this year, you'll learn to focus on what is truly important and disregard irrelevant price action. My primary focus will be on **low resistance liquidity runs.**

### Advice and Disclaimer
Do not be discouraged by setups that I may not take. Focus on your own model and what works for you.

*   I'm not here to change your trading style.
*   My goal is to teach new traders how to "read the tape" before even using a demo account.
*   This information may be boring or less helpful to seasoned, profitable traders.

### Current Dollar Index Scenario and Potential Targets

The market has already traded up for the dollar into this area.

*   I like the idea of it trading up into the midpoint of this up-close candle, which is a **bearish order block.**
*   The midpoint of an order block is called the **mean threshold.**
*   The midpoint of a gap is called **consequent encroachment.**
*   A bearish order block is not simply the last up-close candle before a down move. There must be alignment and signatures.

*I'm interested in whether we trade through the mean threshold.*

*   **Above Relative Equal Highs:** Buy-side liquidity exists with a small gap.
*   Potential for the dollar to move up to this area.
*   Throughout this week, I'll be watching for signs that it wants to press up into this area.
*   If it does, there's a potential (not a guarantee) for lower prices in forex, stocks, and stock averages.

### Alternative Scenario: Reaction and Sell-Off
I will be watching to see if we see a reaction and start to sell off a little bit. If we do:
*   How far can it go?

Potential Targets
*   **Breaker**
*   **Low High Lower Low**
*   The up close candle in here can trade down as far as 102.30 to 102.55-ish.

### Final Thoughts on Dollar Index
I am focusing on the relationship between levels and why I expect to see either one potentially drawn to.

I don't have a concrete prediction.

We haven't seen a lot of overnight movement. There are no heavy news events. There is an 8:30 report which could produce some movement.

## 2. Euro Analysis
I mentioned earlier in the year that we were going to draw up into these relative equal highs for the buy-side.
*   We could potentially trade up into this fair value gap.

Review previous videos for confirmation.

The bodies are perfectly respected.
*   Observe the close and open on this candle after running up into that.
    *   It's a fair value gap by classification, but specifically a **sell-side imbalanced buy-side inefficiency.**
        *   This means it only delivered price on the downside.

*How does the market algorithmically rebalance and reprice this range?*

It has to deliver it on the upside.
*   It trades up into it, offering the buy-side that was inefficient over here.
*   The market then displaced lower.

We took out a short-term swing low here.
*   I like the idea that we traded down into a **buy-side imbalanced sell-side inefficiency.**

This is a fair value gap, with a singular candle.
*   We could dig down a little bit further.

*Just like we mentioned on the dollar, there's a little bit more upside to fill in its gap.*

This doesn't mean much in terms of opportunity, it just means that's where my focus is.

Just because we're sitting in front of the charts and we have time to be in front of the charts, doesn't mean let's take a trade.

*That's gambling.*

There has to be something for me to lean on logically to frame a condition that would be hopefully high probability.
*   I only want to encourage you to focus on those types of opportunities.

There's a plethora of opportunities intraday that are not really good risk well framed with real good risk reward models.

*   I'm not a big fan of risk to reward, because I think it's a fallacy.

You don't know if your trade's going to pan out that much, and you don't know if your stop loss is going to get hit.
*   No one knows that.

You might look to trade with a specific risk model, five to one, ten to one, three to one.
*   Going into this industry thinking that you're always going to get what you're setting your trade up for is a fallacy.
*   You have no control once you enter the marketplace.

I'm going to be teaching you hopefully to ferret out these opportunities where price action can deliver with the highest degree of probability reaching from one level to the next.

*   I didn't say I'm going to put you in winning trades.

That's a stark contrast to what I'm trying to do here.
*   I'm trying to teach you how to read price.

If you're here to try to like keep score or something like that, that's not what this is.
*   I have other live streams that I'll do things that I'll showcase stuff here.
*   Here, it's lectures teaching getting down to the Brass tax of what you're supposed to be doing before you even press a demo account using the things I'm teaching on my channel.

*Hopefully I've communicated that clearly.*
*   It's not meant for you to follow along and press a live trade.
*   Don't try to trade your funded account with the things I'm going to say today in any future live stream.

It's very important that you understand that.

### Twitter Update

Also, today marks the day where I'm not replying or hearting or liking any posts on Twitter.
*   It is now just a medium for me to alert you if there's something that's got my attention and I'm not live streaming.
*   I'm going to bring something to your attention there.

I don't care to know what your responses are.
*   I don't care if you like it.
*   I don't care if you don't like it.

Don't communicate to me through it, because I'm not reading any of it.

My attention is dialed in the markets for now between now and the second Friday of November.
*   It's all work, no play.

## 3. Cable (GBP/USD) Analysis
Before I transition to cable:
*   Euro posted higher highs up into its Fair Bay Gap.
*   Cable was really weak.

We had this imbalance here, and I wanted to see it run above, take buy-side.
*   It failed to do so.

It looks likely that we'll get down into this sell-side here, if we accelerate through this.


Here is the organized version of the provided text, retaining all details and nuances while improving readability and structure:

## 3. Cable (GBP/USD) Analysis

*   Be mindful that **Cable** has already posted weakness comparatively to the **Euro**.
*   If we see acceleration on the upside for the **Dollar** again (risk-off):
    *   Higher dollar means lower prices for foreign currencies.
    *   Likely lower prices for stock indices, equities, and index futures.
*   If we take out this low, and the dollar accelerates on the upside:
    *   We could see **Cable** draw down into this imbalance here.

## 4. ES (E-mini S&P 500 Futures) and NQ (Nasdaq Futures) Analysis

### Chart Layout
*   **Upper Left:** Hourly chart
*   **Lower Left:** 15-minute time frame
*   **One-Minute Chart:**
    *   Toggled between 5-minute, 4-minute, 3-minute, 2-minute, and 1-minute intervals.
    *   Mimics the static setup in front of the speaker, as seen in the Twitter "Stinger" video.
    *   Eight monitors are used for trading real estate.
    *   One screen displays 1-minute, 2-minute, 3-minute, and 4-minute charts for both Nasdaq and ES, the primary markets for index futures trading.

### Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)
*   The speaker does **not** trade the Dow.
*   The Dow may be flashed when necessary for mention.
*   The speaker is not discouraging others from trading the Dow if they are successful with it.

### Trading Philosophy
*   Focus is on reading price from a classical point of view.
*   Completely "naked" charts, without indicators.
    *   Exception: The red line represents the NASDAQ price; it's not an indicator.
    *   It's a line chart representing NASDAQ price plotted on the ES chart for comparison.

### Adding Comparative Charts on TradingView

1.  Click the "+" symbol on TradingView.
2.  Type in the front month code for the index to compare (e.g., **NQ** for NASDAQ, **YM** for Dow).
3.  **ES** is the base chart for comparison.
4.  To add NASDAQ: Type `NQH2023` (H for March, M for June contract).
5.  Select "New Pane" to plot the comparative chart below.
6.  To compare market breadth:
    *   Toggle the box on the price source.
    *   Select "High" to plot the relationship of highs.

*   When the March contract expires, change "H" to "M" for the June delivery month.

### Market Breadth Analysis
*   Compare highs of NASDAQ, Dow, and E-mini S&P.
*   The speaker is looking at the relationships between highs in one market versus another.
*   Benefit: Can help determine the likelihood of continued price movement higher or lower.
*   Example: If S&P looks stronger but weakness is seen across averages, it indicates a stop run. This is based on **Dow Theory**.

### Upcoming News
*   News is coming in about 25 seconds.
*   It is not considered terribly exciting.

### New Week Opening Gap

*   These are **not** indicators or oscillators.
*   Used to observe relationships between averages.

### Annotating the New Week Opening Gap

*   The levels displayed are the **New Week Opening Gap high and low**.
*   Only interested in seeing where the market opens on Sundays; no Sunday trading.
*   Annotate the opening price on Sunday and the closing price on Friday.
*   The range between these prices is the New Week Opening Gap.
*   This gap acts as a strong price magnet if the market is not trending.
*   The market gravitates back to it, acting as support and resistance.

*Important Note:* Journaling is essential when watching this content to note repeating patterns.

### Key Levels Within the Gap

1.  **Opening Price (Sunday)**
2.  **Closing Price (Friday)**
3.  **Midpoint:** Calculated by applying a Fibonacci retracement from Sunday's opening price to Friday's closing price.

*   The midpoint is especially sensitive, with the low, high, and midpoint being critical.

### Visual Differentiation

*   Use bold, black lines to distinguish the New Week Opening Gap levels.
    *   This indicates the levels originate from a higher timeframe.
    *   Contrasts with blue or red lines used for liquidity pools.

### Current Market Observation
*   Price has traded up to the New Week Opening Gap.
*   Previous attempts to probe above have failed meaningfully.
*   Little price action has closed in or offered buy-side liquidity above the **consequent encroachment** (midpoint).

### Potential Scenarios

*   Even if the market goes lower and takes out the low this morning:
    *   It could reject and attempt to move back up into the New Week Opening Gap if the dollar weakens.

*Important Note:* This analysis is not based on supply and demand.

### Trading Philosophy (Continued)

*   **Focus:** Areas and markets where manipulation is obvious or expected.
*   **Setups:** Repeat using phenomena based on markets trading to liquidity.
    *   **Buy-Side Liquidity:** Above a high or relative equal highs.
        *   Can be an entry to a new trade or a closing target for an existing trade.

### 2022 Trading Model
*   Primary focus will be on the 2022 model taught last year.
*   The speaker wants to get the audience thinking beyond that model.
*   This allows those who have outgrown the model to broaden their horizons.
*   Just because the speaker might not trade a specific price swing doesn't mean it's not valid.
*   The goal is to be a mentor that allows traders to bring their own flair.

### Current Market Analysis (5-Minute Chart)

*   Liquidity exists below the current low.
*   Classical technical analysis suggests placing stop losses just below the low.
*   This area contains sell stops, creating **sell-side liquidity**.

### Market Behavior
1.  Price rallies up, then breaks down below the low.
2.  Market shifts bearish.
3.  Look inside the price leg for any inefficiency.
4.  Once the low is broken, enter with the expectation of the 2022 model setup.

### Rationale

1.  **Buy-Side Taken:** Relative equal highs above the area.
2.  When the market is dropping, shorts place their stops above the high.
3.  The market rallies up, engaging all the buy-side liquidity (buy stops) above these highs.

### Expectation

*   Price will show a willingness to go lower because it went up for real orders.
*   No need for Level 2 data to see this.

### Smooth Edges

*   The market tends to make smooth edges jagged (e.g., relative equal highs).
*   The market runs up, spends time there, then breaks lower.
*   Taking out the lows is the market model from 2022.

### Entry Point

*   After the displacement, go back through the price leg.
*   Look for inefficiencies or fair value gaps.
*   The fair value gap is the entry point (do not chase).

### Contrarian Approach

*   The speaker will teach how to enter shorts when the market is going up.
*   Requires practice and desensitization.
*   The goal is to be profitable, not just correct.


Here is the organized version of the provided text, retaining all details and nuances while improving readability and structure:

## Profitable Trading: Risk Management and Mindset

### Profitability and Risk Control
*   The primary goal of trading should be to be profitable and to control and manage risk.
*   This should be the number one factor driving trading decisions.

### Ego, Pride, and Uncertainty in Trading

*   In the beginning, entering the marketplace is driven by the desire to be profitable.
*   Over time, this can morph into a need to always be right, driven by ego, pride, and an inability to embrace uncertainty.
*   Fear arises from this inability to embrace uncertainty.
*   Humans tend to overemphasize individual transactions or ideas.
*   A single trade is insignificant, yet beginners often make it paramount, defining their worth as a profitable trader.
*   This is a common experience.

### The Illusion of Perfection

*   The desire for trading to be black and white or perfect is unrealistic.
*   The idea of never taking a losing trade is a fallacy.
*   Instead, focus on the probabilities of repeatable patterns.
*   Analyze historical data to identify patterns that tend to occur under specific circumstances.
*   For example, observe what happens when relative equal highs occur.

### Example: Relative Equal Highs and Displacement

*   With relative equal highs, the market runs up.
*   Wait and observe the market's behavior.
*   If the market drops, further observation is needed.
*   If the market rallies again and runs above the rejection block (as shown on the speaker’s YouTube channel), followed by a displacement lower:
    *   This willingness to break sharply below a swing low after taking buy-side liquidity frames a high-probability short.
    *   It indicates that buy-side liquidity has been taken.
    *   Wait for displacement: the market dropping sharply lower and taking out a specific low.
    *   After this, go back through the price leg and look for inefficiencies, specifically a fair value gap.

### Analyzing the Price Leg

*   Identify the price leg using multiple time frames (5-minute, 4-minute, 3-minute, 2-minute, 1-minute).
*   The example uses a 5-minute chart.
*   The price leg is from high to low.
*   The low represents a break in market structure, or more precisely, a shift in market structure.
*   Anything at this level or higher is considered a potential fair value gap.

### Mentorship vs. Condensed Information

*   Being mentored provides insights that cannot be gained from short, condensed videos.
*   Trying to learn complex concepts, like ICT (Inner Circle Trader) techniques, in a short time frame (e.g., 5 minutes) is insufficient.
*   Just as studying CliffNotes is not a substitute for reading the full book, short videos cannot replace comprehensive learning.

### Equilibrium and Premium/Discount Markets

*   Analyze the run from the midpoint of the price leg (high to low).
*   This specific price leg is analyzed because it took out a short-term low on a candle, indicating a bearish shift in market structure.
*   Lower prices are expected.
*   Any rally is not considered a sustainable run.
*   Stops have already been taken above the high.
*   The shift in market structure below that low means that any rally after establishing the midpoint is seen as a move to go down.
*   Algorithmically, the market will create a premium market, where long positions should be sold (as partials) or short positions entered during rallies.
*   Selling in down candles is chasing price.
*   The speaker teaches the PD (Price Delivery) array matrix to frame a price leg.
*   The focus is specifically on the highlighted price leg because it created a swing low, unlike other price runs.
*   Once this occurs, wait for the price to turn and go back up.

### Fibonacci and Market Structure

*   After a price run down, wait for the price to go back above equilibrium (the 50% level on a Fibonacci retracement).
*   The only benefit of using a Fibonacci retracement, according to the speaker, is for targeting.
*   Observe live executions, position management, and trailing stops.
*   A run above equilibrium within the price leg sets the stage.
*   The market is now in a premium, or overbought, market.
*   Indicators are not needed to derive this.

### Premium and Discount Zones

*   From the starting point to the equilibrium, it's considered discount.
*   The area above the equilibrium is premium.
*   Ideal shorts are in the premium zone.
*   Crossing the midpoint of the discount level indicates that the highest probability short entries have been exhausted.
*   Focus should then shift to taking partials and trailing stops.

### Pyramiding Entries

*   Pyramiding entries are built until the price breaks through the midpoint of the discount range.
*   Review examples to observe this in practice.
*   The speaker learned to pyramid incorrectly from Ken Roberts’ book "The World's Most Powerful Money Manual."
*   Look for the best entry points with the highest probability and levels that the market will respect.
*   Once the price leaves the midpoint of the discount range, the expansion phase is unlikely to offer high-probability pyramid entries.
*   There is a threshold where adding to existing positions stops.
*   Within the premium area of the price leg, there is the highest degree of probability for delivery from entry to targets.
*   Avoid chasing the move and building positions once the price breaks through the threshold.
*   It is crucial in the beginning to do these types of things.

### Advice for Seasoned vs. New Traders

*   For seasoned traders with experience and profitability:
    *   They can glean what they want from the teachings.

*   For new traders with no direction:
    *   The goal is to provide guidance on using the information, framing the logic, and understanding the rules to follow.

### Identifying Fair Value Gaps

*   When the market starts to draw back up into the premium area, analyze time frames and look for fair value gaps.
*   From low to high, check for a fair value gap at or above equilibrium.
*   If a short position were taken there, it would be profitable.
*   However, the stop would need to be at the high, which could be a large range.
*   To address this, be more selective with entries.

### Volume Imbalance and Order Blocks

*   Look closer within the price leg.
*   This approach is not based on supply and demand.
*   Identify volume imbalances (the separation between a candle's close and the next candle's opening).
*   Volume imbalances can occur between a higher close and a lower opening, or vice versa.
*   Wicks overlapping are also important to note as a signature or "glitch in the Matrix."
*   Cutting through candles during retracements can reveal an imbalance.
*   Is there an imbalance in that area?
*   There may be an imbalance between candles.
*   If there are multiple fair value gaps, look for the bearish order block.

### Bearish Order Block and Consequent Encroachment

*   The last up-close candle is a bearish order block.
*   The opening price on this candle is 4130.00.
*   The high on this candle is 4130.00, and the high on the next candle is also 4130.00.
*   If there are a series of fair value gaps, look to trade or enter at the bearish order block, a volume imbalance, or a fair value gap on the other side of the drop.
*   Extend it through the candles.
*   The speaker is trying to explain the logic used to get to the delivery on this setup, which is exactly out of the 2022 model.
*   The volume imbalance and the fact that it's above equilibrium on that price leg.
*   Trading at the first one with the volume imbalance and the fair value gap.
*   Remember the half of an order block is not consequent encroachment. Consequent encroachment is any inefficiency or efficiency. Mean threshold is the midpoint of a candle, a range, or a specific candle that's been delivered in price.
*   If taking this fair value gap, joining it with the volume imbalance, and it’s a bearish order block, the price should not trade above the midpoint of that up-close candle.
*   If the low to high is 4131.5, a stop could be at 4132, resulting in a two-handle or two-point stop loss when entering within the volume imbalance within this fair value gap.
*   The speaker has walked through similar examples in the stock indices before.


Here is the organized version of the provided text, retaining all details and nuances while improving readability and structure:

## Advanced Trading Concepts: Fair Value Gaps, Volume Imbalances, and Market Structure

### Introduction: Studying Hindsight and Real-Time Data

*   A **fair value gap** can act as a resistance level, causing price to halt.
*   Studying hindsight is crucial for profitable traders.
    *   Understand the concept.
    *   Identify the pattern.
*   Learning to identify patterns is like learning to track prey.
    *   Examine past occurrences to understand the basics of patterns and setups.
*   After grasping the primary framework, study **real-time data.**

### The Importance of a Systematic Approach

*   Avoid rushing into live or demo trading.
*   There is an intermediate step that traders often skip: taking time to be systematic.
*   Focus on:
    *   Doing things correctly.
    *   Avoiding pitfalls.
    *   Preventing emotional and psychological influence.
*   The pressure of real money can shift focus from **risk management** and **price action** to fear of losing.
*   Profitable traders are not in a hurry to move stop losses to break even.
    *   They understand that a single losing trade does not invalidate their entire model.
    *   They learn from losses without drastically changing their approach.

### Avoiding the "This Doesn't Work" Mentality

*   New traders often abandon a strategy after the first losing trade.
*   Consistent tinkering with a winning model can be detrimental.

### Identifying and Using Fair Value Gaps Correctly

*   Locate the right fair value gap by considering:
    *   **Volume imbalances.**
    *   The presence of a fair value gap on the other side of the displacement leg.
*   If no volume imbalance exists, use the first fair value gap above the equilibrium.
*   When planning a large, pyramided position:
    *   Identify the run-up before the drop that creates a shift in market structure (the **displacement leg**).
    *   Split the displacement leg in half.
    *   Use any fair value gap at this level as support.
*   If there's no volume imbalance, frame the entry on the fair value gap created from the low to the high of the price movement, using the equilibrium level.

### Volume Imbalances and "Glitches in the Matrix"

*   The speaker emphasizes the importance of journaling, not just passively watching.
*   **Volume imbalances** are key areas to watch.
    *   They are "glitches in the Matrix" or coded occurrences.
    *   Occur when there's a separation between a candle's close and the next candle's opening.
*   Train your eye to immediately recognize:
    *   Fair value gaps.
    *   Swing highs and lows.
    *   Volume imbalances.

### PD Arrays and Reacting to Price

*   From a high point to a low point, a volume imbalance is a **PD array**, signaling a potential price reaction.
*   The speaker indicated that they expected the price to go below a certain low.
*   The teaching focuses on a five-handle run as a starting point.
    *   This doesn’t limit a trader to only seeking five-handle moves.
    *   This offers a low-hanging fruit objective.
*   Consistency with even small moves (five handles) can be sufficient with proper **money management**.
*   Money management leverages compound interest, increasing monetary risk while maintaining a fixed percentage-wise risk.
*   Large, heavy-handed trades are not suitable for beginners.
*   Learning to read price action and achieving frequent, smaller wins builds confidence.

### Liquidity and Market Dynamics

*   **Sell stops** create **sell-side liquidity** below a certain level.
*   **Buy stops** create **buy-side liquidity** above a certain level.
*   Smart money and algorithms target these levels.
*   Smart money traders accumulate short positions against buy stops, anticipating a move down to sell-side liquidity.
*   The market "remembers" and returns to previous lows and highs.
*   The game of tag analogy:
    *   Buy stops are "it," leading to sell-side liquidity being "it" next.
*   Smart money sells to buy stops, expecting to buy sell stops later.
*   This understanding of the market turns conventional wisdom (buy support, sell resistance) "upside down."

### Managing Positions and Avoiding Over-Trading

*   Once price breaks through the midpoint of the discount range in a bearish scenario, do not take new entries.
*   Focus shifts to managing the existing core position.
*   The stop loss should not be placed below the volume imbalance.
*   The volume imbalance should prevent the rally from continuing.
*   The speaker’s stop could be above a certain high point or at the midpoint, the "mean threshold".

### Understanding Delivery and Balanced Ranges

*   Consider the range between a low and a high point.
*   If that range has been delivered to a specific low, then price action has balance.
*   If price rallies, drops through that point again, and then leaves, a **volume imbalance** remains.
*   It's unlikely that the market will revisit that area.

### Consequent Encroachment and Stop Management

*   A wick represents a gap to an algorithm.
*   **Consequent encroachment** is the midpoint of that wick which is another way of referring to an inefficiency or efficiency.
*   With a volume imbalance in mind, the stop loss should be above consequent encroachment.
*   Understanding these nuances is vital for effective stop management.

### Dollar Index and Risk Assessment

*   The speaker also briefly touched on the dollar index.
*   The repricing of a down-closed candle (sell-side imbalance buy-side inefficiency, or **SIBI**) leads to upside delivery.
*   After hitting that level, especially near the New York opening, the market may consolidate.
*   Because a level has been reached, it doesn't give much to work with, and one would probably trade specifically the afternoon session.
*   **Risk On**: Dollar is dropping, foreign currency and stocks likely to go higher.
*   **Risk Off**: Dollar is rising, stocks and foreign currency likely to go lower.
*   The dollar and other assets act like a teeter-totter.


Here is the organized version of the provided text, retaining all details and nuances while improving readability and structure:

## Market Analysis: Dollar Index, Euro, Gold, and S&P Futures

### Introduction: Macro Analysis and Market Interrelation

*   If the **dollar is going lower**, it's going to be easier for buy signals in **S&P Futures and/or Forex** to go higher.

### Euro and Cable Analysis

*   **Euro:** Revisiting the five-minute chart on Euro.
*   **Cable:**
    *   Analysis reveals "cable is ugly."
    *   There was nothing tradeable, and a short position likely would have been stopped out.
    *   A specific short entry point is identified, along with the likely stop-loss point that would have been hit.

### Gold Market Outlook

*   Significant drop observed.
*   Watch a specific level on a water block.
    *   Breaking through the middle of the candle on a closing basis could lead to a move into a specific area with sell-side liquidity.
    *   Otherwise, the market might rally into a down-closed candle with a high and a "kinda low" SIBI (Sell-side Imbalance Buy-side Inefficiency).
    *   This fair value gap could act as resistance before a potential move lower, especially if the dollar continues to strengthen.
*   The drop in the gold market aligns with a macro perspective of dollar strength.
*   Macro analysis should be revisited regularly to avoid being misled by lower time frame charts.
*   Trading against core macro analysis is possible, but not recommended for beginners.
    *   Focus on consistent application and improvement of core analysis.
    *   Avoid "insanity," which is jumping between methods, models, educators, markets, time frames, and trading styles.

### Pre-Market Preparation: Fair Value Gaps and Liquidity

*   Assessment of a fair value gap.
    *   A fair value gap is observed but deemed unsuitable for trading due to prior price action.
    *   Price has already moved significantly and tapped into sell-side liquidity.
    *   At the open, a potential sell-off could entice short positions before a rally.
*   **Volume Imbalance:** Identifying the only exposed area in price.
    *   Absence of overlap between the preceding candle and the current candle defines a SIBI (Sell-side Imbalance Buy-side Inefficiency) or fair value gap.
    *   The speaker clarifies this is an observation, not a recommendation to buy.
*   The importance of understanding what to do with identified patterns is emphasized.
    *   The current price action has already fulfilled several objectives on the dollar and a run on liquidity ahead of 9:30 AM.
    *   If price were higher, a short position targeting a specific low would be considered.
    *   Because prior models have already delivered, one must be cautious.

### Market Structure Analysis: Electronic vs. Regular Trading Hours

*   Electronic trading hours show a different chart compared to regular trading hours.
*   Electronic trading shows a gap from yesterday's close.
    *   The market might perceive this as a gap lower, enticing "street money" to sell.
    *   A rally back into that range is more probable than chasing the market lower.
*   Not every fair value gap or imbalance warrants a trade.
*   The market is opening.
*   Desire to see the market take out a specific low.
*   Reaction from the fair value gap is noted for study.
*   Rallying above the low and finding support would be a bullish sign.
*   Otherwise, the market could continue lower, potentially finding another opportunity later in the morning or afternoon.
*   Regular trading hours perspective: a gap down is visible, potentially leading to selling pressure.
*   4106.50 level identified as significant due to consequent encroachment on a wick.
*   The range from the close of yesterday to the open of today is likely to be traded back into, potentially reaching a fair value gap.

### The Importance of Observation and Developing Independence

*   The importance of patiently observing candle formations and their logic.
    *   Crucial for independent analysis and avoiding reliance on social media or other people's opinions.
    *   Following successful traders may lead to codependency rather than independent trading skills.
    *   While some individuals prefer to follow others, developing independence is a stronger trait.
    *   Some individuals are better suited to follow because they understand their limitations.

### Recap: Market Structure and Liquidity Runs

*   The market delivered a low resistance liquidity run, supported by the dollar index going higher and the Euro and Gold going lower.
*   Emphasis on journaling these observations to improve morning sessions.
*   If the drop had not occurred before 9:30 AM, it would have been an obvious opening session trade.
*   The speaker emphasizes that the setup had already transpired by 9:30.
*   Patience is essential, as trades will repeat themselves.
    *   Avoid rushing into low probability, uncertain times due to FOMO ("fear of missing out").
    *   Hearing information on the charts is not a reason enough to enter a trade. It's gambling.

### Trade Examples: Fair Value Gaps and Support Levels

*   4106.50 level should be monitored.
*   A trade that the speaker wouldn't take is described, trading the fair value gap.
    *   Despite offering five handles, it doesn't meet the speaker's criteria.
*   If the market finds support after breaking above, a run up to a specific level is possible.

### Market Dynamics: Fair Value Gaps and Order Blocks

*   The market has traded up through the fair value gap.
*   Observation of down-closed candles to the left (order blocks).
*   The midpoint of those ranges is potentially a bullish order block.
*   The speaker is watching the midpoint of that level and does not want to see price move back below it.
*   If it was a trading day, less than full leverage should be applied, due to the market undertone of a stronger dollar.
*   The risk off environment could pressure long entries in Forex or index futures.
*   Effective risk management involves measuring various factors, not just identifying patterns.

### Capital Preservation and Risk Management

*   Primary role as a trader is to preserve capital and manage risk.
    *   Without these, patterns and strategies are ineffective.

### Volume Imbalance and Market Resistance

*   The next point of interest is the volume imbalance.
*   Desire to see price trade through the volume imbalance with speed and without retesting it.
*   The speaker does not want to see price stall short of the box and then retest.
*   The dollar index has been bullish, and could pressure this trade.
*   Trading in a high resistance liquidity run.
*   Despite potential targets, the speaker is teaching about high resistance liquidity runs to help avoid them, or at least to reduce risk.
*   Trading in these conditions increases the probability of being wrong.
*   The speaker teaches students to specifically target times when the market is likely to move in one direction.
*   Describing the current market conditions makes it harder to defend a trading argument.


Here is the organized version of the provided text, retaining all details and nuances while improving readability and structure:

## Market Analysis: Navigating Low Probability & High Resistance Conditions

### Identifying Low Probability Trade Setups

*   A low probability trade setup is defined as one where you can argue both the buy and sell sides.

    *   Example: "I could see a sell here, I could see a buy here."
*   A high probability trade, conversely, is overwhelmingly likely to move in one direction due to multiple supporting factors.
*   This definition is nuanced and more applicable to experienced traders.
    *   New traders may not fully grasp it.
*   Profitable traders understand their specific setups.
*   New traders are just "floundering around," chasing hot tips without understanding their own model.

### Recognizing High Resistance Liquidity Runs in Real Time

*   Scenario: Being unaware of the **Dollar Index's** behavior and entering a trade.
*   Discovering you're in a high resistance liquidity run.
*   Action: Implementing a time filter.
    *   Looking for favorable price action within the next two to three minutes.
    *   Specifically, wanting to see the price trade higher, take out the short-term high, and touch the volume imbalance.

### Lower Timeframe Analysis: 5-Minute, 4-Minute, and 3-Minute Charts

*   Lower timeframes reveal a lot of "chop."
*   The speaker is only explaining what is *likely* to occur.
    *   Price has already moved down, taken out the low.
    *   A volume imbalance exists.
    *   There's a fair value gap within the gap established from yesterday's trading to today's opening.

### Identifying Relative Equal Highs and Market Manipulation

*   On the 3-minute chart, clean relative equal highs are visible.
*   The speaker favors the idea of the market running below the low one more time, hitting **4106.50** (possibly piercing it).
*   Rejection of these levels could indicate significant opportunities.
*   Currently, there's a lot of uncertainty.
*   These conditions arise after the delivery of an objective on a setup, particularly on the sell-side, before the 9:30 AM opening.
*   This pre-9:30 AM delivery contributes to morning chop at the open.
*   The "easy setup" (going short) has already occurred and reached its target.
*   The market might be trying to force a narrative that it's going lower.
*   Presenting relative equal highs to entice retail traders (street money) to see it as resistance.
*   Stop-loss orders are likely resting above those highs (buy-side liquidity).
*   The market could "rip" above that and the volume imbalance.
*   Potential target: the gap, refined by the current candle on the 3-minute chart.

### Anticipating Chop and High Resistance Conditions

*   Goal: Learning to anticipate chop and when the market will "rip" higher.
*   Even in the presence of a high resistance liquidity run.
*   The market has traded to the volume imbalance.
*   Observation: The speaker doesn't want to see the price go down and close below the midpoint of the down-closed candle.
    *   Touching it is acceptable if it "rips" higher aggressively afterward.

### The Emotional Toll of Choppy Market Conditions

*   Imagining traders who have already entered positions.
*   Experiencing anxiety and questioning the analysis.
*   Worrying about the outcome of a trade that shouldn't have been entered in the first place.
*   Contrast: Having peace of mind by understanding the market and not being emotionally committed.
*   Those not pushing the button are learning more today.
*   Learning about fear, greed, and buyer's remorse.
*   Current conditions shouldn't inspire confidence; they're choppy.
*   Market conditions feel like being "strangled," creating a sense of impending doom.
*   Aim: Finding trades that are easy, where the price moves in your favor quickly, resulting in large, rapid gains.
*   That's a low resistance liquidity run signature.
*   The speaker is teaching how to *recognize* these conditions, not just *know* when they exist.
*   High resistance liquidity runs can still deliver, but with stress and potential failure.
*   Failure is always a possibility, but more likely in these conditions.

### Post-Liquidity Run Analysis and Key Levels

*   The market has taken out relative equal highs, traded into the volume imbalance, and returned.
*   Monitoring the fair value gap for potential resistance.
*   Possible target: the 4106.50 level.
*   "Tug of war" market conditions.
*   The speaker is glad to be uninvolved.
*   Younger traders might feel compelled to participate.
*   Monitoring the **4121** level.

### Identifying Breakers and Recognizing Market Difficulty

*   The market appears to be respecting a breaker (though not a perfect one).
*   Observation: Lower low or low.
*   Watching price reaction in this area, focusing on the bodies of the candles, not the wicks.
*   Recognizing that this choppiness is difficult to read and comes with experience.
*   Caution: Identifying correctly doesn't equate to skill in these conditions, especially without executing a trade.
*   The purpose is to feel and recognize the difficulty in reading the market.
*   Action:
    *   Upon discovering you're in these types of environments, close the trade.
    *   Closing the trade prevents spending more mental capital than potential profit.
    *   Even if it reaches the target, the stress isn't worth it.
    *   Focus on cleaner setups.

### Avoiding 50/50 Scenarios and the Value of Patience

*   Avoiding trading at the open when the move has already delivered pre-market.
*   It becomes a 50/50 scenario.
*   The speaker hopes the market doesn't reach the red box (target) to demonstrate the validity of the teachings.
*   Wanting to be proven wrong to emphasize the risks of these conditions.
*   Aim: Demonstrating why these conditions should be feared.
*   Avoiding the urge to force a trade.
*   Instead, closing the trade and waiting for cleaner opportunities.
*   "Cleaner" means:
    *   Efficient price runs without excessive retracements.
    *   Retracements to specific, visible levels.
*   Question: Is it easier for the market to reach 4121 or 4106.50?
*   Currently a 50/50 probability.
*   Attributing the outcome to skill is a fallacy.
*   The speaker acknowledges falling victim to this as a young trader, attributing luck to skill.
*   Wisdom is gained through experience and pain.

### Analyzing Candle Behavior and Fair Value Gaps

*   The bodies of the candles aren't showing a willingness to get back above the original 5-minute fair value gap (green box).
*   Reviewing the one-minute chart.
*   Reinforces the 50/50 nature of the market (4106.50 or 4121).
*   Traders should be at peace knowing they're not influenced by potential moves.
*   Numerous cleaner, easier opportunities will arise.
*   The current candle touched the fair value gap as resistance.
*   If it goes below, the likely target is the sell-side liquidity at 4106.50, with a consequent encroachment wick.

### Addressing New Traders and Emphasizing Education

*   Acknowledgment that new traders might find this analysis overwhelming.
*   Emphasizing that it becomes familiar with repetition.
*   It requires more effort than the average person is willing to put in.
*   Commendation for wanting to learn.
*   Trading is one of the hardest things in the world.

### Late Entry Scenario: Analyzing the Current Chart

*   Scenario: Arriving late to the charts and seeing the current price action.
*   Feeling: Confident about a move to 4106.50.
*   But not feeling compelled to enter immediately.
*   Assessment: Does anything resemble taught setups? No.
*   Entering now would be gambling.
*   It's a 50/50 condition.
*   Falling victim to this type of day if you can't recognize it.
*   Warning: YouTubers are likely trying to force a particular direction right now.
*   Avoid being influenced by others' opinions in live streams.
*   New traders should avoid public trading to prevent impulsivity.
*   Instead, focus on sound logic, risk management, and following a model.
*   Avoid performing for an audience.
*   Task: Study whether the volume imbalance acts as resistance for a run to 4106.50.

### Encouragement and Market Recap

*   Praise for disciplined traders who haven't traded today.
*   Those chasing the market lower at the open haven't seen much downside delivery.
*   Despite breaking below the old low at 4113.
*   The market has run short-term buy-side multiple times, only taking out a couple of lows.
*   Likely, the morning low has been established, and 4121 will be the next target.

### Applying Filters to Manage Risk

*   Analyzing a down-closed candle, focusing on the midpoint (close to the wick).
*   For devil's advocates holding long positions:
    *   Wanting to see the price run higher in the next two to three candles (on the one-minute chart).
    *   Reaching back into the old box (a specific area).
*   If in a trade and recognizing a high resistance liquidity run, use the two to three-minute filter.
*   If it doesn't deliver as expected (above the blue line), close the trade.
*   This time filter prevents holding onto potentially worsening or stagnant positions.

### The Pitfalls of "Easy" Setups and the Fear of Missing Out

*   Eventually, you will fall victim to these conditions.
*   Markets often present seemingly beautiful, easy setups.
*   But once you enter and pay commissions, you regret it.
*   Resisting the urge to close out of fear of missing a subsequent move.
*   More often than not, you'll regret holding onto the trade.

### Conclusion: Observing Choppiness and Uncertain Conditions

*   Everything points to choppiness and uncertainty.
*   Briefly reviewing the NASDAQ and Dow charts.
*   Closing any open positions and being content with not trading.
*   The market isn't delivering as expected.


## Market Commentary: Navigating Time Filters, Liquidity, and Market Psychology

### Implementing the Time Filter Parameter and "Cutting Bait"

*   The **time filter parameter** was activated, but the anticipated price delivery didn't materialize to the minimum extent desired.
*   Action: **"Cut bait"**.
    *   Definition: Either closing an existing position or ceasing interest in pursuing any opportunities for the current trading session.
    *   Transitioning to the sidelines, remaining flat, and refraining from further market engagement.
    *   Avoiding retrospective analysis of potential missed moves ("oh, I wish I would have").
*   Longevity in trading is achieved by:
    *   Consistently executing correct actions.
    *   Dilgently avoiding incorrect actions.
*   Experience reveals that regretting premature exits due to problematic conditions is less frequent than regretting holding onto losing positions.
*   In **"crummy conditions,"** moving to the sidelines is the optimal strategy.
*   Dismissing claims of consistent profitability from specific chart patterns (**"XYZ patterns"**) as **"nonsense."**

### Piercing the Daily Low and Targeting 4106.50

*   Another instance of the daily low being pierced.
*   Desire to see the **4106.50** level tagged.
*   Observing a **breaker** pattern.
*   Analyzing lows on both the **E-mini S&P 500 (ES)** and **NASDAQ** charts comparatively.
*   Expected target: the **4106** level.
    *   **4106.50** specifically refers to a wick on a five-minute chart.
    *   Consequent encroachment occurred at **4106.50**
*   Assessment: Evaluating the potential for a return move back into the gap formed between Friday's close and today's opening.

### Afternoon Session Outlook and Trading Plan

*   Anticipating improved price action during the afternoon session.
*   Preference for a setup involving a run during the afternoon (1:30 PM to 4:00 PM EST).
*   This preference is contingent on current market observations.
*   Acknowledging the potential for unforeseen events during the lunch hour.
*   Identifying this framework as a potential plan for the afternoon trading session.

### Analyzing the Gap Between Yesterday's Close and Today's Opening

*   Price has advanced approximately halfway through the gap.
*   Gap range defined by yesterday's day session close and today's 9:30 AM opening.
*   Acknowledging the potential for chart clutter but emphasizing the importance of visualizing the gap representation.
*   Importance of having these levels marked on the chart.

### Session Conclusion and Emphasis on Patience

*   Ending the morning session.
*   Describing the session as uneventful.
*   Highlighting elements of price action that are typically favorable.
*   Emphasizing the importance of recognizing situations where inaction is warranted.
*   Acknowledging the difficulty for new traders to appreciate the value of patience.
*   Counteracting the feeling that constant engagement is necessary.
*   Reinforcing that market movement cannot be forced through analysis or desire.
*   The market must be naturally predisposed to move higher or lower with minimal resistance (**low resistance liquidity runs**).
*   Recognizing the potential for this lesson to be perceived as unprofitable.
*   These types of conditions can lead to:
    *   Needless trades.
    *   Chasing breakouts.
    *   Attempting to recover losses quickly.
    *   Compounding losses.
    *   Account drawdowns.

### The Dangers of Trading Before 9:30 AM in Choppy Markets

*   If the anticipated move occurs before 9:30 AM, expect chop at the 9:30 AM equities market open.
*   Focus on trading the afternoon session instead.
*   Addressing the apparent contradiction of sometimes trading before 9:30 AM.
*   Clarifying that trading between 7:00 AM and 9:00 AM is acceptable if a valid setup forms.
*   However, understand the potential for messiness at the 9:30 AM market open.
*   Avoiding the self-deception of viewing this messiness as an opportunity.
*   Recognizing that such conditions can lead to:
    *   Reckless trading.
    *   Account churn.
    *   Drawdowns.
*   Drawing parallels to experiences with hucksters on America Online in the early 1990s.
*   Stressing the importance of knowing where these conditions are likely to form.
*   This knowledge can prevent:
    *   Loss of control.
    *   Over-expecting price delivery.

### The Value of Experience and Avoiding Forced Trades

*   Acknowledging that recognizing these conditions is easier in hindsight.
*   Emphasizing that recognizing market conditions only comes from lived experience.
*   Highlighting the interesting reaction at the **410650** level.
*   Monitoring whether the price can reach and find support at the **breaker** candle.
*   Personal "addiction" to price action over the last 30 years.
*   Observing the behavior of **NASDAQ** relative to the **S&P 500** at the **410650** level.
*   Noting NASDAQ's failure to make a lower low.
*   Hypothetical scenario: "Gun to my head," favoring a long position.
*   Preference to see a trade down to the fair value gap, followed by a rally.
*   Stop loss below the midpoint of the down-closed candle.
*   Warning against interpreting this as a trade recommendation.

### High Resistance Liquidity Runs vs. Low Resistance Liquidity Runs

*   **High Resistance:** Creates pausing, deeper retracements, and potential failure.
*   **Low Resistance:** Would have resulted in a rapid move past **4119** given the existing lower low and divergence.
*   Describing high resistance liquidity runs as "give and take" and frustrating.
*   Highlighting the difficulty in getting excited about such moves.
*   Advising new traders who haven't traded with real money to appreciate the pain they are being spared.
*   These types of environments often lead to account losses.
*   Traders attempt to "fix" problems by taking trades they know they shouldn't.
*   This often results in bigger drawdowns.

### Overcoming the Urge to Fix Losing Trades and Recognizing Market Ugliness

*   Recognizing that if the market is ugly, feeling heavy-chested, breathing heavily, or experiencing heart palpitations, that would warrant a stop out.
*   Emphasizing that recognition of the market's ugliness should override the impulse to fix a problem.
*   Acknowledging that forcing trades in such conditions can lead to losses.
*   Drawing a contrast between these difficult conditions and the examples shared on Twitter, which typically occur during low resistance liquidity runs.
*   These easier runs don't involve struggles at particular price levels, sloppiness, or chop.
*   The problem is that sometimes you see these situations allow you to fix a problem, fix an error if it's a losing streak that you had that morning and you'll think that that's skill.

### Divergences, Buy-Side Liquidity, and Afternoon Session Potential

*   Noting a lower low on the S&P 500 that wasn't confirmed by NASDAQ.
*   Emphasizing that this observation alone is meaningless.
*   Context: Large gap lower, multiple instances of taking out the low, and many buy-side levels have been taken out.
*   Anyone selling a breakout is short, and anyone already short feels confident.
*   Large unfulfilled gap above in S&P 500 derivatives between the averages.
*   Averages did not confirm the lower low in NASDAQ.
*   Assuming no crash lower before 1:30 PM, there is a potential opportunity for the market to run up to the **4121-4123** level during the PM session.
*   Having this narrative allows for detachment and observation.
*   If the market has already reached this level by 1:30 PM, the trade is missed, which is acceptable.
*   Acknowledging that failing trades are a normal part of trading.

### Combining Indicators and Market Context

*   Reviewing a combination of technical indicators:
    *   Fair value gap.
    *   Smart Money Theory (SMT) divergence.
    *   Breaker.
    *   Buy-side liquidity.
*   Expressing a younger self would have paid money for these lessons.
*   Relating these conditions to past experiences of blowing up accounts by forcing trades.
*   On any other day, this setup would be treated as a long entry.
    *   Short-term high taken.
    *   Retracement and sell-side taken out.
    *   Divergence (SMT).
    *   Failure to accelerate downward despite gapping lower.
*   Under these circumstances, a rapid move higher to attack buy-side liquidity would be expected.
*   However, the context of a high resistance liquidity run changes everything.
*   The "wind" is against the trader, creating a frustrating experience.
*   This frustration can lead to emotional trading and recklessness.
*   Example: Removing a stop loss, which in this case should be at the mean threshold.
*   Candlesticks reflect psychology.
*   They are Rorschach tests, interpreted according to one's desires and biases.
*   The desire to make money is a powerful drug and is what causes people to push trades and ignore rules.
*   Significance is a powerful drug, as seen in social media.
*   On a day without high resistance, this would have been another entry for adding more to the position.
*   But not possible because we have all of these other factors fighting against you.
*   These are the same challenges experienced during the first-year mentorship.
*   Recalling being in a webinar with hundreds of participants.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining all details and nuances while improving readability:

## Navigating Market Frustrations, Avoiding Forced Trades, and Understanding Liquidity

### The Distraction of Live Chat and the Importance of Focus

*   There were **864** or so participants in the chat window.
*   The speaker admits to making the mistake of being able to see the chat, which proved to be a significant distraction.
*   Attempting to teach over the charts live while simultaneously addressing a thousand questions ("what about this?" "what about that?") created a state of confusion.
*   The speaker felt:
    *   Unable to focus.
    *   Frustrated with himself.
    *   Frustrated with students who weren't willing to listen and see the lessons being presented.
*   The core lesson being taught: Understanding that a **high resistance liquidity run** might present price action that doesn't necessarily deliver as desired.
*   While such runs might eventually deliver, actively seeking trades in those conditions makes maintaining peace of mind difficult, creating unnecessary hardship.

### Avoiding Forced Trades and Recognizing Market Ugliness

*   Desire to see price hit a specific red line and trigger a hypothetical stop out.
    *   This outcome would effectively communicate the lesson of **what to avoid**.
    *   Specifically: Don't try to force trades in these adverse conditions.
*   If price were to run up and hit the buy-side liquidity (indicated by a rectangle on the chart), assuming that represents skill would be foolish.
*   The lesson's focus is *not* about replicating such potentially lucky outcomes.
*   The primary objective is to demonstrate, by contrast, how easily trades work during **low resistance liquidity runs.**
*   **Low resistance liquidity runs** appear easy because:
    *   Everything is aligned in the trader's favor.
    *   Time of day, risk-on/risk-off sentiment, and price delivery are all supportive.
    *   Price action exhibits precision.
*   The Twitter examples shared typically showcase these types of scenarios.
*   The speaker emphasizes the avoidance of forcing trades in Twitter examples when conditions are difficult.
*   Addressing comments and questions received on Twitter: "How is he able to do this?" "How does he know?"
    *   Answer 1: Experience.
    *   Answer 2: Actively avoiding difficult market conditions.
*   Even a very skilled trader will appear like a novice when trading in fickle market conditions that don't present favorable opportunities.

### The Value of Patience and Understanding Market Dynamics

*   It's unfortunate that new traders often lack the patience to appreciate good wisdom and sound logic.
*   New traders often weigh everything on the basis of "right or wrong" and "making money or not making money."
*   The speaker aims to prove the underlying logic, even if immediate profits aren't apparent.
*   Emphasis on showing how to avoid problematic conditions going forward.
*   Analogy: If you don't understand where the potholes are, you will drive straight into them, messing up your "alignment."
    *   Hitting a pothole in a car throws off the alignment, leading to premature tire wear and increased costs.
    *   In trading, failing to recognize problem areas leads to unnecessary losses and account drawdowns.
*   Lesson: Don't "floor it" (drive at 55 mph) into a pothole you know is there.
*   New traders often lack the understanding of these lessons and focus instead on "pushing a button" to make money like in a video game.
*   Trading is far more complex than that.
*   Traditional books and courses often fall short in conveying these nuances.
*   It often requires sitting with someone and walking through the process candle by candle over time to truly grasp the concepts.
*   Asserting that nobody on Twitter or YouTube could have outlined all of this mess beforehand and navigated it efficiently.
*   Those who claim to do so and present themselves as profitable in these conditions are likely experiencing luck, not skill.
*   The speaker recalls attributing early successes to skill when they were actually due to blind luck, a bitter pill to swallow.

### Analyzing Price Action and Potential Trade Setups

*   The speaker wanted to see price take out the highs at the consequent encroachment of the fair value gap.
    *   Specifically, price needs to "rip through" the area, not simply go above it and then return.
*   Example Scenario:
    *   Hypothetically, a trade might have yielded five handles.
    *   The stop loss would have to be placed below a specific level for any partials.
    *   If something was already taken off, stop would be below the fair value gap and the order block.
    *   If the price went down and the trade was hit, one would have to be content with the five handles of partials.
*   Highlighting the difficulty of even securing five handles in the current market conditions.
*   Emphasizing that the price action is "bumping up against that old low".

### Divergences, Correlations, and Potential Trade Re-engagement

*   Noting the price action: low, lower, lower.
*   Observing that this wasn't confirmed by NASDAQ.
*   This observation isn't necessarily an indicator in itself.
*   Explanation of the speaker's belief:
    *   Since NASDAQ was unwilling to make a lower low when the S&P 500 did, it creates a "cracking correlation."
    *   Ideally, S&P 500, Dow Jones, and NASDAQ should move in the same direction.
    *   If higher highs are being met in E-mini S&P 500 (ES), they should also be met in NASDAQ and Dow Jones.
    *   When these correlations break, it signals something noteworthy occurring behind the scenes.
*   Such instances often indicate an intermediate-term shift in the market.
*   However, in the current conditions, these divergences are harder to rely upon and can lead to stop outs.
*   Trader would then have to be content with any partial profits taken.
*   Expressing a desire to do more, but accepting that the market will give what it will give.
*   Interest in seeing if the market "rips" now that the level has been shared.
*   Presenting a scenario:
    *   Trader took a partial profit at five handles into the breaker and rolled the stop up.
    *   The trade is then stopped out.
    *   Question: Would there be a way to re-enter the market if it weren't such a difficult day?
    *   Answer: Yes.
    *   Using the mitigation block (a closed candle that is a breaker), the trader would wait for the price to trade above it, come back down, and touch it as support.
        *   This would be used as an entry technique.
        *   The consequent encroachment of the fair value gap would be used as a stop.
        *   The first partial target would be at a particular area on the chart.
        *   Then they would aim for the consequent encroachment of the gap.
*   Explanation of using each PD array as a step-by-step guide, like a mountain climber finding the next handhold or foothold.
*   This approach avoids relying on trend lines or other indicators.

### Filtering Out the Lazy and Recognizing Hard Work

*   This market environment is one of the best things that could have happened.
*   Because it will filter out who's lazy.
*   Recalling many people who initially expressed enthusiasm about learning, only to be deterred by the amount of work involved.
*   These individuals often seek easier solutions, such as indicators.
*   The speaker anticipates seeing them again in a couple of years.
*   Noting the range that has formed between 9:51 AM and 10:28 AM.
*   Describing the market as "disconciliating sideways."
*   Everyone is waiting for a breakout.
*   The speaker believes the market is likely to go higher.
*   There is still a significant divergence on NASDAQ versus the low in the S&P 500.

### Reviewing Market Factors and Emphasizing Patience

*   Encouraging listeners to take a step back and think about what has been discussed.
*   Recap:
    *   The sell-side liquidity below the 4113 level was expected to be attacked, and it was.
    *   Movement below that level hasn't been significant.
    *   Each low has been shallow.
    *   While lower lows are being made, they are shallow.
    *   The 4106.50 level was identified from the regular session hours (refer to the video for the exact location).
    *   This lower low is not being met by NASDAQ.
    *   After taking sell-side liquidity and hitting 4106.50, nothing significant happened after the session opened at 9:30 AM.
*   Conclusion: Given all these factors converging, it's best not to force trades or try to trade in these conditions.
*   It's far more difficult than it needs to be.
*   There are other market conditions and setups that are far better for traders to focus on.
*   Trading shouldn't be forced simply because one has time off or because the speaker is live streaming.
*   Now observing a "nice run" above the breaker.
*   Advising against the knee jerk response to immediately enter or thinking one "has to wait" for it to trade away and come back down.
*   One can "trade right in that breaker," but with caution.
*   Watch and see if the price can come back down and just touch the top of the breaker in the same candle.
*   This movement doesn't necessarily need to leave and come back to it, although that is also acceptable.

### Recognizing Turtle Soup and Combining Indicators

*   Reiterating mindfulness of the low and removing chart clutter for better focus.
*   Describing the divergence between NASDAQ failing to make a lower low as a "turtle soup" pattern.
*   How to treat "turtle soup":
    *   It takes the low out at a pre-defined level (4106.50 in this case, mapped out earlier).
    *   Then, wait for something to indicate that it's going to go higher.
*   What is that indication?
    *   A failure in NASDAQ to make a lower low when the S&P 500 does.
    *   Then, a rally.
*   Does this require a shift in market structure?
    *   No. Turtle soup trades don't require that.
    *   You're trading external range liquidity when trading turtle soup.
*   What is that?
    *   The low has sell-side liquidity.
    *   It takes that sell-side liquidity.
    *   Then it breaks away.
*   All that's needed is one PD array:
    *   It could be a fair value gap.
    *   It could be the last down-closed candle.
    *   If there's a fair value gap afterward forming.
*   Outlining the current scenario:
    *   See the volume imbalance - it trades down into it and then rallies.
    *   The stop would be below the volume imbalance, consistent with the speaker's teachings.
*   Logic: If you're bullish, you need to find a PD array that's at a discount.
    *   It has to show a defined level where, below the midpoint of a fair value gap or order block after sell-side liquidity has been run, you can trust where your stop can be placed.
*   The speaker would like to see the price run from here and doesn't necessarily need it to trade back into this area.
*   If it did hit it, the speaker would expect it to react and go get the buyside.
*   New traders often encounter trouble when they get into a trade, get stopped out, and then have to get back in to capture the final portion of the move they were hoping for.
    *   They mistakenly believe this indicates a lack of skill.
    *   It's *not* a lack of skill if you're aware that you can still engage the marketplace and enter again.
    *   You're simply seeing opportunity and re-engaging.

### Re-engaging After a Stop Out and Recognizing Market Difficulty

*   Now observing the price hitting the breaker, running above it, and trading back down into it.
*   A complete re-pricing through the breaker is occurring.
*   Focusing on a down-closed candle and the fair value gap or order block.
*   The mean threshold (half of that) is useful.
*   But the stop has to be below the old low, because that's what this level is here.
*   If trying to use this as an entry, the stop would have to be below the old low.
*   Using the rejection block (the closing price at 4112.50) as a reference point.
*   Again, observing how difficult or how fast the price action fails.
*   Emphasizing that in a cleaner market day, these setups would be much more straightforward.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining all details and nuances while improving readability:

## Analyzing Market Dynamics, Identifying Liquidity, and Navigating Consolidation

### Evaluating Recent Price Action and Potential Scenarios

*   The speaker suggests that in a cleaner market environment, price action around 12:50 would exhibit faster and clearer runs, leading to a more "carnival-like atmosphere."
*   Currently, the market has rallied but failed to surpass a recent high and has returned below an "old low."
    *   This "old low" is the level previously identified as a source of sell-side liquidity.
*   The market is revisiting this "old low," and while a minor rally is possible, driven by an old fair value gap (the only inefficiency yet to be repriced), further decline is probable.
    *   If price trades below this level, it suggests a broader downward trend for the day, not just a temporary liquidity grab.
*   The speaker believes repeated attempts to move lower below the "old low" (this specific level), followed by multiple failed attempts to rally above it, indicate weakness.
*   The "last line in the sand" for a potential rally towards the old gap from the previous day is contingent on a successful climb into that fair value gap. Failure to do so implies further downward movement.
*   Referencing a daily chart, the speaker points to a candle high at **4091.25**. If the low is breached again, price could potentially decline toward that area.

### Examining Daily Chart Levels and Standard Deviation

*   The speaker notes that the market is currently below the fair value gap.
*   Acknowledging the complexity of communicating live with numerous chart elements, the speaker justifies this approach as necessary for tracking market observations.
*   Despite the NASDAQ divergence (not making a lower low), the market is mainly consolidating.
*   The speaker provides daily chart levels to monitor if the market takes out the low.
    *   **4095.25**
    *   **4091.25**
*   Advising caution, the speaker emphasizes that these observations are for study, not trade signals. Viewers should evaluate which scenario aligns best with their trading style and risk tolerance.
*   The speaker is measuring one standard deviation from the high to the low, using it as a "fulcrum point."
*   The speaker is monitoring if the market demonstrates sensitivity to that fair value gap, particularly the consequent encroachment.
*   The speaker’s Fibonacci retracement tool is anchored to specific points.
    *   The high
    *   The low
    *   The tool is acting as a "fulcrum point."
*   If the price moves below the low, the projected target is the same distance from the low to the high, projected downward from that low (one standard deviation).
*   Another potential target is the daily old high, which would reprice the entire buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency.
*   The speaker acknowledges the density of information, advising viewers to review the daily chart explanation for clarification.
*   This area would be a key level if the market breaks the low.
*   A significant down day could lead to further declines.

### Addressing Conflicting Signals in Consolidation and Identifying Clear Trends

*   In a clean market, traders wouldn't encounter an abundance of conflicting Potential Derivation (PD) arrays, simplifying decision-making.
*   The problem with the present trading environment: uncertainty about which Potential Derivation (PD) array to prioritize.
*   This uncertainty arises during consolidation periods.
*   During a clear trend, the market establishes a clear trajectory towards an old high, low, or inefficient area, making it easier to identify relevant PD arrays.
*   In contrast, the current market presents numerous converging PD arrays (Fair Value Gaps, Volume Imbalances, Order Blocks) within a narrow range (9:51 AM high, 10:28 AM low).
*   The speaker emphasizes that market consolidation creates conflicting analyses.
*   Consolidation presents both buy and sell scenarios simultaneously, creating a "conflicted" analysis.
*   Trading within such consolidation is problematic, regardless of methodology, due to constantly opposing signals.
*   The speaker argues that in a choppy, consolidated market, both bullish and bearish positions have equal opportunities to lose money.
*   The speaker stresses that without a strong conviction about the market's likely direction ("where is it going?"), trading becomes gambling.
*   While acknowledging the inherent uncertainty, the speaker emphasizes the importance of assessing price action and past market behavior to gauge likely outcomes.
*   However, past performance is not a guarantee of future results.
*   All factors being equal, a run to an old low or high is more likely in a cleaner environment, free from the constraints of consolidation.
*   In a consolidated market, the trader is forced to be patient.
*   The speaker suggests waiting for the market to move and escape this "mess."
*   The speaker is not a breakout trader.
*   Once the market moves to a higher timeframe key level, anticipating a specific price run becomes easier.
*   This is because when those occur, a volume imbalance is present.
*   The speaker notes the market is touching the top of the Fair Value Gap and returning to the volume imbalance, remaining at the midpoint of the 9:51 AM to 10:28 AM range.
*   Observing a potential Fair Value Gap after a high is broken, the speaker advises monitoring for reactions after repricing.

### Analyzing Liquidity and Identifying Market Tendencies During Consolidation

*   Noting current market consolidation, the speaker suggests identifying recently taken liquidity (sell-side).
*   The speaker then asks, "where is the buy side?"
*   During consolidations, the market tends to move between buy-side and sell-side liquidity.
*   Recently, sell-side liquidity was targeted, so the buy-side is next, with a potential delivery to the 4121 level.
*   Despite the short term moves, the speaker emphasizes that this means "absolutely nothing."
*   Reviewing key lessons from the session:
    *   Anticipating choppy market opens at 9:30 AM.
    *   Understanding the nature of high resistance liquidity runs (frustrating, nerve-wracking).
    *   Recognizing potential turning points using SMT (Smart Money Technique) divergences between NASDAQ and the S&P 500.
    *   Acknowledging conflicting analyses, even with PD arrays (Fair Value Gaps, Order Blocks, Volume Imbalances), without a clear directional bias.
*   The speaker states that if the Market's not going to move, nothing's going to work and it's going to go back and forth.
*   The speaker emphasizes that proximity to the lunch hour (typically 10:50 AM to 11:10 AM) is significant.
*   The speaker instructs listeners to annotate their charts daily, recording observations about price action during this period (10:50 to 11:10).
*   The speaker encourages listeners to study when the Market's consolidating.
*   New York lunch macro happens around 10:50 to 11:10.
*   The speaker explains that this period represents a "last-ditch" effort before traders take lunch.
*   This lunch hour can be a pause, continuation, or reversal of the existing trend, or it can remain sideways.
*   The speaker states it doesn't matter which one of those conditions are there you're going to see a move form between 10:50 and 11:10.
*   Regardless of the condition (consolidation, reversal, or trend continuation), a price movement will likely originate during this time.
*   This movement represents a smaller segment of price action focused on tapping into untapped liquidity.
*   The speaker explains that they have done executions of this on their Twitter feed based on this logic.
*   The trader needs to identify which liquidity pool has not yet been targeted.
*   The speaker then references how they have already seen sell side taken.
*   The levels inside the consolidation between 9:51 and 10:28 are going to be conflicting.
*   Once reaching 10:50 to 11:10 (the lunch macro), the approach shifts to identifying untapped liquidity.
*   Within the 10:50 to 11:10 window, a price run originates, regardless of overall market conditions.
*   This run targets liquidity that hasn't been tapped.
*   Anyone with a stop Above This High felt safest especially when it dropped from here.
*   A short-term High traded back down in and then rallied after that fair value Gap.
*   Rallying higher above this point signifies a shift in market structure during the 10:50 to 11:10 timeframe.
*   The speaker states that this is algorithmic, not harmonic or related to supply/demand.
*   The speaker believes that it is internally built, codified, code, and it runs for liquidity that has not been tapped.
*   The speaker says many times this can be a key point for the day and it never returns back down below it or above it in reference to if it was you know going lower.
*   The speaker’s goal is for the listener to study how these consolidation days work between 10:50 and 11:10 and look for a price run.
*   They encourage them not to take his word for it and go back and forward through the charts.
*   The speaker references the open and how they worked that old low multiple times inducing new shorts to chase it going lower.
*   They mentioned this level down here that's a falcon point, and it has to go below that low if it goes below then you can see lower prices.
*   The speaker says this return back down into that fair bag you got right here that price run to here is your last like bus stop before you get to your your destination.

### Demonstrating Close Proximity Entries and Analyzing Short-Term Price Action

*   Returning to the analysis, the speaker points to a specific fair value gap.
*   A price run to this area represents the "last bus stop" before reaching the ultimate target.
*   If a trader misses this entry, they likely will miss the entire move.
*   The speaker said watch this one here as soon as it traded into it or into this candle here it's close as you can get inside that volume and balance that's it now watch what happens.
*   The speaker is going to look in this small little segment of price action right here.
*   The area the speaker is looking at has been changed to the color yellow.
*   Dropping down into a 15 second chart the speaker is looking for 2 down close candles.
*   A high low everybody got order block inside the volume imbalance it trades down to it and then boom that's your lunch macro right there using the 15 second chart.
*   The speaker uses this type of analysis often and has used a one minute chart to record the executions.
*   He then says "don't run away from this lesson thinking I'm beating my chest look how smart I am because I was showing you even in these conditions it's difficult for me as well and how you need to identify what it's likely to do to you as a Trader how does it how did it feel for you today watching price action where you frustrated were you anxious were you second guessing were you thinking that you know they changed the algorithm they're not changing."
*   The bottom line is it's gonna stay like this it's going to continuously do this but the markets are going to do one of three things.
*   The speaker believes that the markets are going to consolidate or it's going to go higher or it's going to go lower.
*   The speaker concludes it is important to frame the outcome to the markets likely to go higher to this level this is my magnet and prices draw on liquidity this is where the Market's going to reach to.
*   The speaker closes by stating that if you can't clearly see that in your analysis you are gambling.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining all details and nuances while improving readability:

## The Importance of Time and Market Awareness

### The Futility of Methodology Without Direction

*   The speaker emphasizes that the specific methodology used, the teacher, or the lineage of teaching is irrelevant without understanding the market's *likely direction*.
*   Consistency is impossible without this knowledge.
*   Even the speaker’s "PD arrays" (Potential Derivation arrays) will fail if the market is stagnant.
*   The most important element is **time**.

### The Role of Time in Price Action

*   Price action is contingent on reaching a *specific time*:
    *   Time of day
    *   Day of week
    *   Week of the month
    *   Month of the year
    *   Seasonality
*   All these factors must align, like "pins in a tumbler."
*   A trade idea cannot solely rely on simple concepts like order blocks or fair value gaps.
*   Additional difficulties highlight the necessity of considering factors like time.

### The Impact of Time in the Final Trading Hour

*   **Time** is a key component for clearer market understanding.
*   Three specific macros operate during the final trading hour (3:00 PM - 4:00 PM).
*   While not all three occur daily, at least one is always present.
*   The speaker intends to teach these macros later in the year during PM sessions.

### Encouragement for Self-Reflection and Future Sessions

*   The speaker wants listeners to record their feelings from the session.
*   He requests that they refrain from communicating on Twitter, as he uses it only for broadcasting information.
*   The speaker is not looking for likes or engagement on Twitter; it's solely a tool to reach the audience when live sessions are not possible.
*   If the session was insightful, particularly in understanding difficult market conditions and how to navigate them, a thumbs-up is appreciated.
*   The next session is tentatively scheduled for Thursday or Friday of the current week (Tuesday).
*   The schedule will be announced via Twitter.

### Accepting Market Realities and Preparing for Future Opportunities

*   The speaker apologizes if the session was unhelpful, acknowledging that he cannot control the market.
*   He waits for the market to behave predictably.
*   He promises better market conditions in the future.
*   Viewers should appreciate learning how to identify situations that lead to losses and account blow-ups.
*   Recognizing these conditions beforehand is crucial to avoid falling victim to them.
*   The speaker concludes with "Until next time, be safe."

### Musical Outro

*   The content concludes with a "[Music]" tag, indicating the presence of background music as the speaker signs off.

# Daily Market Review - A Detailed Breakdown

**Video URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH1e-TVrK6k

## Introduction: Live Streaming Adjustments

*   Good afternoon, folks. This is a quick market review.
*   **Live Streaming Setup:** I learned today that my truck toggling setup wasn't correct during live streams. This has been adjusted for future sessions.
*   **Recording vs. Live Reviews:** Initially, I was considering recorded reviews, but editing is too time-consuming. Live reviews, with their "one and done" nature, are more efficient.
*   Expect rough cuts with occasional errors, as I'll skip the extensive editing process.
*   With 40 weeks of these reviews ahead, efficiency is key.

## Dollar Index Analysis

*   **Daily Dollar Index:**
    *   Mentioned this morning: we were trading within the fair value gap.
    *   Price touched the top of the gap later in the morning, followed by a retracement lower.
    *   This retracement was a cause for concern.
    *   I indicated slight upside potential for the dollar, translating to minor downside for Euro/Dollar, Cable, and E-mini S&P.
*   **Hourly Chart:**
    *   Price moved up to the top of the fair value gap.
*   **Apple Daily Chart:**
    *   Candle bodies respected the fair value gap high.
    *   This demonstrates **Precision, Organization, and Boundaries.**
    *   Price respecting these boundaries suggests a higher probability of similar behavior in the future when other factors align.
    *   The market traded up, then weakened intraday.
    *   This weakness was attributed to "smoking mirrors" from **Fed Chair Powell**.

## Euro/Dollar Review

*   **Euro/Dollar Performance:**
    *   As predicted, a bit more downside was observed before a rally.
    *   The market rallied up, attacking buy-side liquidity.
    *   **Imbalance Analysis:**
        *   Delivery from the candle's low back up to the close.
        *   The subsequent candle delivers to the downside, starting near the previous candle's low.
        *   **Specific Price Levels:**
            *   Candle low: 1.07619
            *   Following Candle High: 1.07622 (Slightly above)
        *   Complete retracement back to the range.
    *   **Stalling Point:**
        *   Price stopped at 1.07663, bumping into this candle's high.
        *   A small fair value gap remains.
    *   **Balanced Price Range (BPR):**
        *   Why did it stop dead in its tracks?
        *   We left the BPR, tested it upon return, left it again, and came all the way back.
        *   Revisiting the entire range is possible, but unlikely, especially with the presence of a fair value gap.
        *   The fair value gap will likely be revisited later.
        *   The high of this candle is interesting, reaching 0.07666.

## S&P, Dow, and NASDAQ Analysis

*   **Not Indicators:** The charts displayed are NOT indicators, despite appearing as such.
*   They represent the Dow Jones Mini and NASDAQ Mini respectively.
*   These are simple plots on an online basis.
*   This was covered extensively in the morning's live session.
*   I will try to provide a brief review to save time since everyone has a lot to review from the livestream.

## E-mini S&P 5 Minute Chart and Observations

*   During the 8 AM session I mentioned the following:
*   **Potential Afternoon Scenario:** If the market failed to move significantly lower to shake off lower prices, it would likely revisit this area in the afternoon.
*   This scenario played out as predicted.
*   I ended the live session around this point.
*   **Price Action Difficulties:** I covered the difficulties of interpreting price action when focused on a very small time frame.
*   Zooming out provides a better overview, avoiding overreaction to minor fluctuations.
*   This is especially important within a consolidation pattern.
*   **Predicting Choppy Conditions:** I also discussed how to anticipate a choppy morning session.
*   **Micro Market Structure:** While one-minute and sub-one-minute structures (e.g., 15-second, 30-second) can be useful, they are best applied when the market is dynamic and trending, rather than consolidated.
*   Navigating within such a tight range is not recommended until a specific time of day.
*   This was the "diamond" of the day's session.

## Twitter Communication and Level Updates

*   I will check Twitter later for questions/comments.
*   **Twitter's Purpose:** I use Twitter primarily for one-way communication.
*   **Level and Draw on Liquidity Updates:**
    *   I will post levels and draw-on-liquidity points I'm observing.
    *   **Important:** These are NOT trade signals or invitations to trade.
    *   They are for observation purposes, allowing you to follow my real-time analysis.
*   **Notification Settings:**
    *   You can turn off notifications if you prefer not to be disturbed during market hours.
*   **Boss's Time:** Take on the risks without slacking too much on work.

## Five-Minute Chart Level

*   The level identified on Twitter corresponds to a five-minute candle from **February 3rd, 2023 at 12:55.**
*   Locating this candle on the ES chart helps you identify it.
*   By providing the date and time, you can find the specific candle.
*   Prior to the market reaching that level, I tweeted about it: **"Note that right there."**
*   After the price reached that level I said **"Leave it alone and rest"**
*   **Seek and Destroy Market Profile:**
    *   All of this is considered to be a Seek and Destroy Market Profile
    *   Requires you to be very careful or you will be destroyed.
    *   You will regret holding onto trades for too long.
    *   Market dips down taking out sell side liquidity.
*   **Morning Session Level:** I discussed the 4106.50 level this morning.
*   The market hit 4106.00, two ticks below that level.
*   The level of opportunity presented by knowing this is significant.
*   The reasons this level was considered at all was covered in the morning session.

## 15-Minute Chart Analysis

*   **Imbalance Identification:** A candle for the blue shaded area, where price dipped down for a discount.
*   **February 1st, 2023 at 14:30:** Timeframe for this event (New York local time).
*   Calibrating your charts to New York time is crucial for following my Twitter updates.
*   **15-Minute Imbalance Extends Further:** Keep the extension on your chart.
*   **Current Buy-Side Liquidity:** Buy side liquidity Resting just at the current High.
*   And also here.

## Further Observations

*   Apologies for the airplane noise.

## New Week Opening Gap

*   **Fair Value Gap and Order Block:**
    *   Fair value gap identified.
    *   Two down-closed candles acting as an order block.
    *   Market trades back down into that.
*   **Potential Targets:**
    *   Market may reach up to 4130.
    *   The ideal target is 4134.25, which is the low of the new week opening gap (Sunday opening price).
*   **Friday's Close and Consequent Encroachment:**
    *   These levels are marked on the chart.
    *   Consequent encroachment: the midpoint between Friday's close and Sunday's open.
*   **Consolidation Patterns:**
    *   When the market is consolidating, these levels become important.
    *   Price reacts to these specific levels, not zones.
    *   Observe how price respects these levels, gravitating back to them.
    *   Through the buy side to look for the upper portion of that range.

## Seek and Destroy Detailed Explanation

*   The run up and down is the the reason why this is called "Seek and Destroy."
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Starts off consolidated and appears as if you can find a trade.
    *   Takes out the short-term high, then the short-term low.
    *   Continues back and forth.
    *   Then, a big run occurs.
    *   A large pull back occurs shortly after.
    *   Anyone long from earlier is now stopped out.
    *   Then the market continues up.
*   **One-Minute Chart:** Sell side taken out ran out a small little Gap in here.

## End Of Day Tasks

*   11 minutes remaining in the session (the last hour of trading).
*   Perform a detailed study every day.
*   **Annotation Strategy:** On days with live streams, I will not log anything on TradingView. Use my live stream annotations instead. On days without live streams, I will log annotations on TradingView.
*   Pull back into this by side of balance outside efficiency does it want to run run up into and touch the high end of the 15 minute City?
*   **Expanded Range:** Calibrated the range to the 15 minute time frame after initially calibrating for 5 minutes.
*   **Intimidation:** It was a little intimidating to see how many people were watching today's live stream.

## Conclusion: Gratitude and Results

*   Gratitude for the large audience (70,000+ viewers at some point).
*   Achieved a live stream without using any F-bombs.
*   The trading session yielded a five-handle run.


# Decoding Market Entries and Future Sessions

## Favorite Fair Value Gaps (FVG)

*   **Definition:** A specific price range identified by one candle's high and the subsequent candle's low.

## Entry Points: Leveraging Consequent Encroachment

*   **Consequent Encroachment:** Represents the highest probability entry point within the FVG.
    *   It's defined as a single pass through the high of previous candle and the low of the next candle.
    *   It is located between the high and low of two candles.
*   **Institutional Order Flow Entry Drill:** An alternative entry strategy, positioned at the low of the FVG candle or one tick below.
*   **Precision Over Zones:** Emphasizing specific price levels rather than ambiguous "demand zones" for entries.
    *   Demand zones are too ambiguous
    *   Specific criteria is needed to use price levels as entry points.

## Profit Targets: Setting Realistic Expectations

*   **Handle Range:** Example from 4175 to 4182 equates to seven handles.
*   **Ideal Target:** Aim for setups with a potential of at least 10 handles.
    *   Even if the top of the 15 minute fair value gap isn't reached.
*   **Risk/Reward Philosophy:** Prioritize opportunities with the *potential* for 10 handles, not necessarily requiring it.
    *   This was taught to his son
    *   Looking for five handles requires a range that can get 10 handles

## Example Trade: 15-Minute Fair Value Gap

*   **Consequent Encroachment Entry:** 4175.25
*   **Target:** High of the 15-minute fair value gap (4185).
*   **Result:** Successfully delivered over 10 handles in the last hour session.
*   This was expanded to the 15-minute time frame.

## Addressing Complexity and Promoting Simplicity

*   **Initial Perception:** Acknowledging that the strategies may initially seem complex due to unfamiliar terminology.
*   **Simplified Execution:** Highlighting the ease of identifying key elements after repeated exposure.
    *   Waiting for a favorite Vega
    *   It is only two price levels
    *   Looking for institutional order flow into drill or consequent encroachment.
    *   This is easy.
*   **Crucial Skill:** Emphasizing the importance of reading candlestick patterns in real-time to anticipate market movements.
*   **Managing Risk:** Recommending respect for risk and patience in applying strategies, especially with funded accounts.
*   **Commitment to Consistency:** Assuring ongoing delivery of precise, logical, and algorithmic trading concepts.
    *   These are all time and price oriented
    *   No cherry picked, no hindsight after the facts.

## Future Live Session Plans

*   **Session Timing:** Anticipated to be at 8:15 AM New York local time.
*   **Chart Preparation:** Plans to pre-annotate charts for efficient presentation during live sessions.
*   **Delivery Method:** Will show the charts, so that users can screenshot them, and when he goes off that chart to use live data, then the user will have the screenshot in front of them with the levels that he is referring to.
*   **Session Goal:** Providing valuable content efficiently, balancing YouTube presence with other commitments.
*   **Content Focus:** Walking through the morning until the session is satisfying to him.

## Community Engagement and Encouragement

*   **Call to Action:** Encouraging viewers to show support through "thumbs up" on the video.
*   **Twitter Updates:** Promising to provide updates via Twitter regarding the next live session.
*   **Gratitude:** Wondering what is on twitter.
*   **Disclaimer:** Let everyone know that they should be safe, and until next time, he will talk to you later.

Okay, here's the reorganized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining all details and nuances while improving clarity and structure.

# **Market Analysis and Trading Insights (October 26, 2024)**

## **Disclaimer**

Please understand that trading involves risks.

## **Introduction: Feeling Under the Weather**

Foreign folks, I apologize for being a little late today. I'm grappling with what feels like a head cold. I suspect I caught it from my friend Sean when I took them out to dinner the other day. Thanks, Sean!

## **Dollar Index Analysis: Daily and Hourly Charts**

### **Chart Overview**

We'll examine the **Dollar Index** using both daily and hourly charts. The daily chart is on the left, and the hourly chart is on the right.

### **Daily Chart: Within Consolidation**

Looking at the **daily chart**, we're still within the cell-side imbalance, buy-side inefficiency. I'm not convinced that we're going to go higher yet.

### **Hourly Chart: Shaded Areas and New Week Opening Gap (NWOG)**

The area shaded in pink on the daily chart corresponds to the shaded area on the hourly chart.

*   **New Week Opening Gap (NWOG):** This is the area between Friday's close and Sunday's opening.
    *   **Definition:** The range between Friday's close and Sunday's opening price.
    *   **Magnet Effect:** This range acts as a magnet, drawing price back to it unless it's a runaway trend.
    *   **Consequent Encroachment:** Dividing the NWOG range in half gives you the consequent encroachment, which is where bodies (price levels) are resting.
*   **NWOG Calculation:**
    1.  Identify the range between Friday's close and Sunday's opening.
    2.  Divide that range in half to find the consequent encroachment.

### **Algorithmic Price Delivery**

This isn't just the ES Futures tactic; it's algorithmic. Price levels are very specific, and the market refers to them consistently. It's predetermined, whether you agree with that concept or not.

### **Trading in Trending vs. Consolidation Environments**

*   **Trending Environment:** Price may touch a level once and then continue in the trending direction.
*   **Consolidation Environment:** Price returns to levels multiple times within a week, indicating a lack of a significant near-term price run.

### **Trading Strategy in Consolidation**

*   Be nimble with intraday trades.
*   Avoid forcing trades, especially when looking for a large run.

### **Utilizing NWOG Levels as Support and Resistance**

Treat the NWOG range like support and resistance. The high and low of the range will be represented by either Friday's close or Sunday's opening.

*   **Scenario 1:** Friday's close is higher than Sunday's opening price.
*   **Scenario 2:** Friday's close is lower than Sunday's opening price.

The three levels (Friday's close/Sunday's Open, Consequent Encroachment) are highly sensitive, and price will gravitate towards them.

### **Personal Belief vs. Practical Application**

You don't have to believe that markets are delivered by an algorithm. You can still subscribe to the idea of free markets driven by supply and demand. Regardless of your belief, these concepts will serve you well.

## **Current Market Observation: Hourly Chart**

### **"Too Clean" Price Action**

The price action on the hourly chart is "too clean" for me, raising concerns about tomorrow's trading.

### **Retail Sentiment vs. Potential Breakdown**

Retail sees this as a bull flag on the daily chart. If we break below the lows on the hourly chart, there's not much to rebalance below. Everything is overlapped, indicating efficient price delivery.

### **Efficient Price Delivery Explained**

Think of it like a painter using a roller. Every time the roller goes on the wall, it distributes the paint evenly. Similarly, price is distributed on the chart, filling any gaps.

### **Areas of Inefficiency**

The only area of inefficiency on the hourly chart is a very small separation between a down-closed candle and its subsequent candle. We've essentially repriced back down into this candle's high with this opening.

### **Current Market Sentiment: Indecisiveness**

This price action is difficult to work with. I'm requiring the market to show me more. The daily chart shows strong upside momentum, so a pause or slowdown is reasonable due to the fair value gap.

### **Bullish Scenario**

If the market rallies above the fair value gap, my focus goes to the buy-side liquidity pool, which was previously an old volume imbalance.

### **Trading Plan: Lacking a Hard Line Bias**

I have no hard-line bias going into tomorrow. I can argue both sides of the equation (bullish and bearish).

*   **Bullish Scenario Requirements:**
    *   Rally above the fair value gap.
    *   Price comes down and touches the fair value gap as support, preferably before taking out the high.
    *   The target would be the midpoint (mean threshold) of the up-close candle on the daily chart.

### **Hallmark of Transparency**

When I don't know, I'll admit it.

*   Students often expect me to know everything that will occur next.
*   It's unrealistic and unhealthy to hold that expectation.
*   When the market communicates indecisiveness, I don't know what the algorithm will reprice to.

## **Defining Bullish and Bearish Scenarios**

### **Bullish Scenario Details**

If price rallies above the fair value gap overnight or tomorrow, and then comes down to touch it as support (preferably before taking out the high), I would be comfortable that it would likely run up to the mean threshold of the bullish candle on the daily chart.

### **Bearish Scenario Details**

We've left relative equal lows. Ideally, I would have preferred to see the market come through these lows and then deliver higher. Since we've left both equal highs and equal lows, it gives me peace of mind to rest on my hands and not trade.

### **Avoiding Gambling**

In this instance, trading right now would be gambling because there's no hard line, high probability signal for either direction. The bodies are respecting the low end of the range, which is the fair value gap on the daily chart.

### **Bearish Breaker**

The low between the high and high is a bearish breaker. The two down-closed candles together are considered one for the hourly chart.

*   Take a rectangle and place it on top of these two down-closed candles and extend it to the right.
*   We have traded up into that breaker block.

### **Bearish Trading Plan**

If we break lower, come back up, and touch the small fair value gap, I would look for potential weakness going down to the low. If we take out that low, I think we're really going to run for the sell side below. This doesn't mean the dollar will collapse but I would look for this intraday tomorrow.

### **Current Market Profile: Indecisiveness**

We're currently in an indecisive market profile. One could argue either case (bullish or bearish), and neither is high probability, making it basically gambling.

## **High Probability Setups and Low Resistance Liquidity Runs**

### **Characteristics of High Probability Trades**

If my concepts are present and it's a high-probability setup, it's next to impossible to argue the other side of the equation.

*   **Bearish Scenario:** I see no way whatsoever for a bullish scenario.
*   **Bullish Scenario:** I see no opportunity for a shorting opportunity.

This indicates a high-probability, low-resistance liquidity run.

### **Identifying Low Resistance Liquidity Runs**

Low-resistance liquidity run signatures are easily identified when the market is one-sided.

### **Applicability Beyond Trending Markets**

It doesn't need to be in an existing trending market. It's when I'm looking for the liquidity runs, once they're obvious.

### **Confidence in Low Resistance Liquidity Run Signatures**

I have strong conviction when trading because I'm inside of a low-resistance liquidity run signature within a market structure that's predisposed to go in the direction I'm trading. Everything is heavy-handed in my favor, not against me.

*   How do I trust when it's going to do these low resistance liquidity run signatures?
    *   Because I'm inside of a low resistance liquidity run signature within a market structure that's predisposed to go in the direction I'm trading in.

### **Importance of Experience**

These conditions in price action deliver that understanding to you. But you have to do this for a number of months and weeks and see it and it'll start communicating by experience. It's forged through experience daily, seeing it. That's the only way you're going to get that skill set.

### **The Challenge for Some Students**

Failed students don't want to wrestle with this. They want it easy: "one, two, three." This is how it is when you can identify the low-resistance liquidity run signature. But the market doesn't always deliver those conditions, and you have to identify what that is, navigate it, or stay out of it.

## **Navigating Market Resistance and Immediate Gratification Setups**

### **Avoiding High Resistance Liquidity Runs**

Don't try to trade in high-resistance liquidity runs. You saw the way the market was holding it back the other day when chair was trying to jawbone, holding it down. It was consolidating, then it finally went where I said it was going, but not easily.

### **Aiming for Immediate Gratification**

Look for immediate, instant gratification setups where you're not wrestling around and it doesn't give you that much time to be worrying about whether you're on side or off side.

*   It means you're either on the right side of the trade or not on the right side of the trade.

### **Timeframe and Performance**

If you're getting into trades and it's not moving for you within a reasonable amount of time, you're probably not on the right side, or you entered too early, or you're absolutely just completely wrong.

### **Defining "Reasonable Time"**

What's a reasonable time for a trade to perform?

*   I don't know. It's relative to your personal appetite for patience (or lack thereof).

If you're using a one-minute chart, you want to see some movement within 10 minutes of your entry, minimum. You've got to see something showing you. If you're in there for 10 minutes and it's not performing for you, then you're probably not on the right side, or you entered too early, or you're completely wrong.


Okay, here is the well-structured, readable format of the provided text, retaining every detail, context, and nuance of the original content.

# **Market Analysis and Teaching Insights**

## **Introduction**

There are many benefits to me, as a teacher, for using these one-minute charts. It provides lots of practice and instant feedback.

*   While teaching on a **daily chart** wouldn't be as effective, the same logic applies.

I don’t know:

*   What we’re going to do with the **Dollar**.
*   How that’s going to impact the **stock market**.
*   How it’s going to impact **Forex**.

We’re going through this so you can sleep soundly tonight. I don’t think it's going to be a big explosive move that I need to be worrying about because I can't see it yet. It's not there yet. The cards are still being shuffled. Obviously, we’ll see what happens in the morning.

## **Euro Dollar Analysis**

### **Daily Chart Overview**

**Euro Dollar** on the left-hand side is the daily chart. We went up into our **sell-side inefficiency**, which is a fair value gap.

*   Hit that beautifully and came back down into this **buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency**.

### **Hourly Chart Relationship**

This shaded area (on the daily chart) corresponds to the shaded area on the hourly chart on the right-hand side.

### **Price Action Details**

*   We have this drop into this **Fair Value Gap** on the daily chart.
    *   It goes down into **consequent encroachment** (about the midpoint of it).
    *   Then, we have this really nice run trade them to **bearish order block**, buy-sides taken, trades up, and then rejects.
    *   It immediately comes back down into the **order block**.
*   We rally, then we slop, and we just increase and then run one more time up into this, but leaves the high intact.
*   Then, we just fall off today and now we're resting right on top of that same fair value gap.
    *   This is the up-close candle.
    *   You should already have it in your chart based on the analysis and charting I already did for you on YouTube the other day.

### **Inverse Correlation with Dollar Index**

Everything I mentioned for **Dollar**, just reverse it. Everything I mentioned for the **Dollar** applies here, but in reverse order, because everything is inversely correlated.

### **Current Market Sentiment**

*   I like the fact that there's a **buy-sell liquidity pool** here.
*   I like the fact that we're sitting at the **fair value gap** again.
*   I like the fact that we've had all of this back-and-forth price action in here and we moved higher and left that there.
*   We dropped today.

To me, it feels – and this is just me speculating right now, it's not me forecasting, I'm not co-signing because for me to say that would be indicating that I have an opinion or bias already for a dollar, and I don't – but I like that the market is sitting at this level and we have all this rejection in here, and it just looks too obvious, in my opinion, that they left this here.

### **Speculation vs. Forecasting**

Does that mean that the Euro Dollar is going to rally up and Dollar is going to go lower?

*   Well, if it goes here for Euro, then yes, the **Dollar Index** would drop.
*   But I don't know that yet, and there's nothing in here that would get me excited to take a trade. I wouldn't be able to do anything, so I'd have to wait and see what we get tomorrow.

### **Key Times to Watch**

*   What do we see at **8:30 AM** in New York time?
*   What do we get **9:30 AM**’s opening?

So, it’s a matter of wait-and-see, versus when there are other instances where the market is really giving me clear indications about what it’s likely to do.

*   I'll talk to you about it, and I'll say, this is what I think it’s going to do, and there it is, and it'll be one-sided. There won't be the both sides of the equation.

### **Trading Strategy for Students**

I'm telling you the things I'm looking for. If you're watching price action, and you see something that you know has been taught to you that would expect to see delivery to that level, whether it be going lower or going higher, you'll know what I'd be looking for if I was there with you at the time saying, "Okay, what do you think is going to go to, ICT?" Well, I would think the draw would be here.

### **Importance of Independent Analysis**

I'm giving you both sides only in those instances where I don't have a bias that’s determined. I give you both sides that way you can study it, and you can also beat me to my analysis and/or my review, so that way you can compare and contrast what I show in the next video review versus what you already have in your annotation. So that way it’s interactive.

### **Encouraging Organic Development**

It allows you to be progressive about learning, not just simply listening to ICT and hear me talk about the things I'm talking about. It allows you to go in and let your eye and your attention go to where you like within price action – things that you want to see as a signature for your model. So, it allows you to develop organically, not me trying to shove you into a mold, which won’t work.

### **Current Market Profile**

We’re indecisive right now for Euro, just like Dollar.

## **E-Mini S&P Analysis**

### **Previous Analysis**

I mentioned that we had a **buy-sell liquidity pool** here a week ago or so, and we ran up into that obviously.

### **Volume Imbalances**

We have a **volume imbalance** here, and we have a **volume imbalance** in here.

*   Ran up, failed to go above the high today.
*   We had a little bit of a give back.
*   These two **volume imbalances**, while I don’t have them noted, you want to have them both annotated on your daily chart.
*   Extend them through price action for Thursday and Friday's trading because those levels may be impactful.

### **Annotation Guidelines**

You don’t want to just do, like, one big bulky area. Don’t use the highest high and the lowest low of the volume imbalances collectively; do them individually and then label them respectively in your chart.

### **Monitoring Price Action Response**

That way, when you watch price action, if it responds to those levels – and I’ll explain what that means, what it would look like – they're going to behave just like the new week opening gap, which is what’s being shown here on the hourly chart.

### **Hourly Chart: NWOG**

*   The **S&P** hourly chart Friday's close, that’s what this level is here, and then Sunday’s opening down here. Actually, I just realized I have that one – I already tried to... No, that’s not accurate.
*   And that should be on a different level. The Friday closing price and Sunday’s opening price, make sure that’s on your chart.

### **Gap Analysis**

Then, whatever that range is every new week, and you do the same thing every time there’s a gap opening.

*   So, when we close our session at 5 PM each day, Monday through Friday... Well, not Friday, but Monday through Thursday, when we open again at six o'clock, when there’s that one-hour gap of no trading, you want to do the same thing I’m teaching you to do with the new week opening gap.

### **Applying NWOG Principles to Daily Gaps**

Use the closing price, and then the new opening price at six o'clock, and then that that range, divide that in half and extend that throughout the next 12 to 16 hours, and that right there will also act much like you see with the new week opening gap.

### **Intraday Trading Conditions**

So, we have the **News Hour Release** here. It was kind of wild today, really a lot of uncertainty in the beginning of the day. It was a mess. I wasn’t feeling well on top of it, and I just didn’t... I didn’t like what I was seeing, and I was able to look at a couple different little small moves and such, but it wasn’t until later in the day where I felt very strong conviction about what it is I was looking for, and I’ll explain that now.

## **Lower Timeframe Analysis**

### **15-Minute Chart Homework Assignment**

Now we go into the lower timeframes. On the left-hand side, there’s our 15-minute timeframe. Here’s a homework assignment on your 15-minute chart on ES.

*   This high, you want to put your Fibonacci on the closing price and the high and get the 50 level.
*   Then take your fib and place it on the 50 level down to the close.
*   That new 50 level is 25% of this wick. That’s what this level is here.

### **Price Sensitivity Observations**

Go down to your lower timeframes, and you’ll see, much like you see over here, look how price is sensitive to that. It’s that level trades down.

### **Usefulness of the Level**

Now, how’s that useful? Why is it even useful? Because I’m sure some of you are thinking, well, that’s cherry-picked.

*   If you think that the market is bearish, and you’re going to come to these conclusions in your own analysis, in your own good time, if you think the Market's not likely to go through an old high that has a big long wick like that, if it’s extremely challenging for it to go higher, it will not likely do what? Trade the consequent encroachment, which is the midpoint of the gap.
*   So, if it’s not going to go there, where could it go?

### **Precision over Zones**

I don’t do things in zones. I don’t just go out there and say, "Well, here’s a big area where, you know, if it goes there and turns around, I can come back and say, look how smart I was."

*   I give you very specific levels because that’s exactly what the algorithm is going to do.

### **Algorithm vs. Randomness**

If there is no algorithm, then there would be what? Randomness.

*   But the argument is there's all this buying and selling pressure that always completely delivers precision when you're looking for it with the lenses that I'm providing you.

### **Evidence of Algorithmic Control**

If you look for the algorithm with these signatures as the footprints to look for, and you’ll see the evidence is all over it. But if you go in with the argument that there is no, or there is no algorithm, it’s buying its own pressure, it’s all completely random, and you know, retail things and organized, usually usage of a indicator-based strategy, that's the real reason why price is going up, then you'll see what you want to see because you're going in looking for what you want to see.

### **Challenging Conventional Wisdom**

Let’s strip it away and say, okay, if there is control, if there is a management function behind price and how, where, and how and when it goes where it’s supposed to go, how is it possible? Because this, I mean, I already know there's an algorithm. I mean, when you’re talking to it. So, if you’re on the offense about it, then how does one argue how all these things with buying and selling pressure and you know, all these theories and approaches to trading, how is it that price stops and turns on a dime and goes to the levels that I'm outlining beforehand, and their logic repeats itself over and over again, and it makes this perfect sense.

### **Personal Conviction**

It makes perfect sense when you look at it that way. I can’t be convinced. No one could convince me. Like, if I didn’t know it for a fact, no one would be able to convince me after seeing this, like this, that there's something behind it all. There’s something controlling the ebb and flow.

### **Debunking Depth of Market**

It feels like it’s organic. It feels like it’s, you know, it’s a free market. Yes, the market's going to fluctuate. There’s all kinds of movement around there. It’s fine, but the argument you see, and this is what's proposed all the time, all you have to do is look at the depth of market, look at the DOM, look at the level two data, you’ll see the orders. That’s what’s going on. Those orders are spoofed. They’re not necessarily there. Just because you see them on there does not mean that that’s exactly resting there. It can be there for a little while and then pulled.

### **Everything is in the Chart**

Don’t think it can’t happen. Oh, there’s people at Goldman Sachs that got fined for doing it. Oops. So, that’s a gimmick. You don’t need depth of Market. You don’t need level two. Everything is in the chart. It’s being told to you with the open, high, low, and close – those three... I’m sorry, there’s four price levels.

### **The Big Lie of Market Control**

Remove the idea of a free market because when you study price-based with time, certain times of the day the market will do certain things, but you’re told over time and indoctrination that buyers are controlling the market higher and sellers are controlling the market lower. Oh, sellers are coming in, they’re muscling the market. No, they’re not. Buyers are coming in, they’re muscling the market. No, they’re not. You may be buying when price is going up, but you didn’t push it there.

### **Challenging Volume-Based Analysis**

Volume, we have a new high, but it’s on low volume. That doesn’t make any sense now, does it? Here, we have a higher high. Look at this big old run-up, these candles, these huge, it’s really big. It goes up and takes out a previous High, but it does so in lower volume, and you’re going to argue and say that it’s buying pressure took it up there. How’s it arguable that buying pressure was less than the previous time it rallied up there, but yet it outperformed it in magnitude and delivery?

### **Market Efficiency Paradigm Shift**

That’s make-believe. That’s a fairy tale. But the big lie that’s told over and over and over again eventually is accepted, and it feels uncomfortable to wake up and see things aren’t really like this anymore. There’s something that has transitioned, so there’s something different in these markets now, and they’re highly efficiently delivered, and there’s nothing to be afraid of.

### **Invitation to Learn Price Action**

You guys that are arguing about it all the time, you don’t want to come to this team. There is no ICT team. You want to learn how to read price. That’s it. That’s all you want to do. And when you identify these signatures that repeat, and there’s a number of them that I’m going to teach new this year, you will see there’s absolutely nothing to be fearful of. They’re not going to stop it. It can’t be stopped.

### **Access to Data is Key**

As long as there’s a market, it will repeat, and that’s the wonderful thing. It cannot be hidden from you. It can’t be, as long as there’s going to be an open and a close to a market and the valuation that we can measure at the highest high and the lowest low. When that stops, when the ability for us to be able to see that and have that information in our hands, when that is kept from you, then and only then should you have something to worry about because as long as you have access to data, guess what? You have everything you need.

### **Understanding Market Manipulation**

Because everything you’re reading here is how we’re going to fleece the retail. We’re looking at these moments where the market is likely to do damage or trick, entice, lure traders in, go up, and engage a pool of liquidity for buyers. If it meets a criteria that fits a narrative, why should it go up there?

### **Smart Money Strategies**

Well, if there is an entity that is collectively referred to as smart money, they will use that liquidity above an old high to get short and aim for what? An old low or an inefficiency below market price, and then they will offset their short position at a discount price, while those discount prices are being viewed by retail Traders as, "Oh, this is our stop loss because we’re trying to be long," and their willingness to sell below an old low is ideal for smart money that wants to buy at a very low price. That’s how they cover their short.

### **Changing Perspective on Market Efficiency**

So, when you change your perspective, and you have that market efficiency paradigm shift in the awareness of how price is actually being booked, listen, it’s not something they want widely understood. That’s why it’s not taught. That’s not, that’s why it’s not shown, and that’s why you’re going to see resistance to it because there’s a lot of people in this industry that don’t want you to know what you’re learning here. Too [ __ ] bad because it’s happening.

### **Revisiting the S&P Chart**

So, back to the **S&P**, this quarter level of this entire wick, that right there, you want to study that. And in your notes, in your in your journal, like something's up in here, in this area here, you want to write that when there is a heavy bearish stance on price, consequent encroachment of a wick is likely not to be traded to. If you suspect that is the case, you get the very specific price level of one quarter of the wick. Don’t take my word for it; go back to your charts, and your jaw will drop.

### **Classic Model 2022 Pattern**

But with that said, the market trades below this short-term low here, breaks lower, and then we have the classic Model 2022 that I taught last year on the YouTube channel. Mark trades up into it, sells off, consolidates a little bit. We go into the New York session with relative equal highs here. That’s buy side.

### **Addressing Potential Confusion**

Now, here’s one of the things that you also will feel uncomfortable about. You’re you’re going to look at certain candles that I’ll refer to, and you’re probably looking at this and saying, well, why didn’t you use this old high here? Well, look what happened.


Okay, here is the well-structured, readable format of the provided text, retaining every detail, context, and nuance of the original content.

# **Market Dynamics and Liquidity Analysis**

## **Fair Value Gap and Market Repricing**

We have a **city** here; it's outside and balanced by sudden efficiency, which is a **fair value gap** by classification.

*   Specifically, it is **sell-side imbalance, buy-side inefficiency**.
*   The market's repriced up into essentially that entire range here, and then we left it.
*   What is this becoming? A balanced price range.

We have to factor in the time of day.

*   Everything being shown here on the 15-minute timeframe, go over here to the five-minute chart; suddenly, things become a lot more clear.
*   Here, we have one, two, three times the market has provided what? A smooth edge.

In your journal, you write: **smooth edges tend to be made jagged.**

*   These smooth edges that look like resistance to a retail trader.
*   You're asking me why am I not using this high here when I've already explained that what I'm teaching you is once it's already done its work here, and then it creates a lower level of smooth relative equal highs.
*   Two highs now, you have three, what's the retail crowd gonna think about that? Oh, that's strong resistance.
*   Therefore, they can think what? They can go short and put their stop loss, which is what kind of stop? A buy stop.
*   They're going to try to go short; the market provides them the reason, the one goes short, what's above here? Buy stops.

### **The Quadruple Top Scenario**

The market rallies up, fails to really bump through it much here, so what does this look like?

*   That's a **quadruple top**. Man, we got to write a new chapter in the books now, right?
*   They're thinking it's really, really strong resistance.

They drop it down; they drop it one more time, take out the previous low here, everybody's on board now, they think it's going lower, and where does the market go?

*   We'll run right back up, takes out all this high, solid liquidity.
*   I was looking for this this morning, but I was fading in and out of sleep because I don't feel well, and I'm watching it, and watching all of a sudden, I woke up from a daze, and I saw the **volume imbalance** sitting there on the chart, and it was coming back right up into them.

### **Camtasia Recording Delay**

Let me please get this thing on because whenever I start Camtasia, it doesn't just start right away recording; it makes you wait these three seconds or whatever, and it's like, come on, man.

*   You gotta wait for this thing to start up, and the whole business.
*   While I'm doing that, I'm trying to figure out, okay, what I gotta say? What am I going to say on the chart?
*   I was like, I'm just gonna just enter and then I'll annotate as I go.

### **4160 Target and Narrative**

Because it has created this relative equal high here, and we ran up, took that. I mentioned this morning on Twitter that I said that you note 4160, which is the **new week opening gap high**.

*   That's basically Friday's closing price of last week on ES.
*   When we're up here, I'm thinking 4160.

What's the narrative that gets us there?

*   Whenever you see smooth edges like this, always, always expect that type of scenario, and it runs up into it here.
*   Once it does that, you're in a deep premium; the market participants are going to see that as well, that's a bullish breakout, resistance is broken.

### **Breakout Buyers vs. Short Protectors**

There's buyers that have buy orders sitting there protecting a short position, but there's also traders that's thinking, okay, this is going down.

*   Maybe all the divergences that may be occurring in your indicators, which I don't need to see an indicator to know that they were diverging in here foolishly.
*   Market rallies up, and they think, all right, now I gotta have confirmation, what's the confirmation?
*   We have to see these levels here broken out because if it breaks out like that, then they're going to feel confident that they can go long, wonderful.

You have buyers that want to break out and go long, and you have buyers that want to protect the short.

*   Beautiful, that's a very, very well-saturated area for buy-side liquidity.

### **Smart Money and Liquidity Pools**

Who would benefit from price just going up there just a little bit?

*   Buyers ran out of steam here; buyers ran up here, buying pressure took us up to here, and then all of a sudden what?
*   Buying pressure ran out, why? Why would it do that when there's a huge pool of liquidity resting right here of buy orders? Oops, oops, oh, we got a problem with that narrative now.

Retail just failed with that logic; it doesn't make any sense.

*   You have a huge pool of liquidity here with real buyers, why didn't that send it higher?
*   Because it's designed to do that; it's only going to go up there and trigger those buy stops so that way smart money, the collective entity that does what I'm teaching you to do in price action, they're going to go in and gather up all that liquidity to be counterpartied to to go short.

They're going to sell it to those buy stops as the market runs right up in there.

*   When the algorithm prices it right there, that's when their orders come in, boom, boom, boom.
*   Where's it go? The level I told you this morning on Twitter, 4160. I'm sorry, 4146.

### **4146: The Draw on Liquidity**

So, 4146, the closing price on Friday, that was a draw on liquidity.

*   A lot of manipulation, a lot of just back and forth back and forth, and once it cleared these relative equal highs, then it was off to the races real quick, sudden decline.

But now, let's go into a lower timeframe chart and take a closer look at it.

*   We'll still stay on the five minutes right here, here's that same zoomed-in area where buy-sell liquidity is resting here.
*   It only bumps up right there like that; once it hits, does it spend a lot of time waiting around? No.
*   Market reaches lower, and while we're inside of this area here, we're still at a premium.

## **PD Array Matrix and Implied Dealing Range**

I'm going to show you how we can use the **PD array matrix** to map out a premium to discount market in a implied dealing range.

*   This is the part where you take notes, folks.
*   We're zoomed in in that same area here, but now in a one-minute chart.

This is the PD array matrix, and the range I'm using here, so that way you can do it on your own charts, not just simply take my chart and think you've done the work from this high down to the 4146 even level.

*   Why am I referencing that? Because that's the target I told you price was going to go to today this morning on Twitter.
*   It's going to return back to what? The new week opening gap.

It's going to be like a magnet, folks.

*   It's going to want to draw back to that, why?
*   Because for the weak, for the entire weekly candle from between the highest high and the lowest low, if it's not a trending market, what's it going to do?
*   It's going to treat the new week opening gap as fair value, and it's going to want to revert back to that continuously, and that allows for a new sentiment to come in.

Oh, it goes back to that that gap.

*   A lot of algorithms, not the algorithm that's the price engine, but the algorithms that operate on the fund level, they will likely use that opening gap to constitute their new trade idea based on a new sentiment idea because it trades back to it, much like I'm teaching you to view it as what? Support and resistance.

So, if it's up here, and I'm telling you all focus on 4146 because it's likely to pull back to that weekly gap that opens on Sunday, what's the nearest price above the gap?

*   It's the Friday's closing price, which is 4146.

If that's the level we're looking for price to go to, and we're above it, and we're looking for lower prices, we create a high here, it starts to pull back and go below the high here in the relative equal highs that we've had now four times, remember the slide before I went to this one?

*   Four times it banged into that level, and then we hit it here and then started to sell off, where are we at?

When price is trading right here, are we in the red area, which would be considered premium relative to the high to the target where we're looking to trade?

*   We're looking for the draw on liquidity, the Terminus.
*   Where is it likely to go to?

Remember, that's the thing I'm teaching all of you to focus on.

*   The part of this puzzle is not knowing where it's going to next, and you're focusing on all the order blocks and what fair aid gaps and when they're staying open, you're missing the whole entire plot.

You have to be trained this year, use this time with me to understand how, why I'm teaching you how, I'm teaching you where is it likely to go to next.

*   Because all that question of what you're looking for and why it doesn't shouldn't do that, that becomes much easier to figure out when you know what the market's likely to do.
*   Also, if I don't know what I'm doing, I won't be right, will I?
*   That it means there's no algorithm, that means there's no way that there's an algorithm if I'm calling specific price levels as an extra on liquidity, and they don't continuously, consistently deliver, guess what that tells you? There is no algorithm.

Every friggin day I'm telling you, I'm only tweeting the wins, I'm not deleting anything, so come on, join the party here.

*   Okay, this is the real this is the real [ __ ] okay, I'm just gonna tell you like that, this is the way it is, this is it, this is the thing you're looking for.

You cannot learn this with one video or video series.

*   You have to be walking it with me, and you see it, and you understand it, and you'll understand what each candle means each time it creates a new one, it falls into place into a storyline.
*   The storyline is they ran the buy stops above those highs, ran it right up in there, broke lower.
*   You already knew 41-46 was where we were looking for the draw on liquidity.

I guarantee when you were seeing this rally up here, you're like, oh ICT got it wrong.

*   I'm not gloating; I'm just telling you I I see this happening, it's like I'm reading all of your minds with these candlesticks.
*   When this thing starts to break down, and we have a target 4146, you need to take your high, if you're short or if you're looking to be short, the high that forms it, you think is a suspect high.
*   A suspect high is a high that's been blown out, and you want to see if it maintains the rejection.

We don't know if this high is going to be well taken out, if you will, until we trade from premium to discount.

*   We have that right here, then the market does what?
*   Returns back up into a premium.

I'm scrambling to get Camtasia open right here, finally, it gets open, I get my chart open, and then right here what's occurring?

*   Look closely, I've already shared it with the Twitter community, and actually showed a execution, so I traded this, not to Simply me talking about in hindsight.

So, you can look at the video on YouTube, I'll take the annotations off in a second, but look what we have here.

*   We have the high to 4146 even, which is the Friday closing price, which is the high end, the top of the new week opening gap with that price level as a magnet.

If price is up here relative to that target, and the high is here, if we go short in here, we're shorting what?

*   At equilibrium or premium, either one is okay, but you can't go in and start pyramiding once we get down into here because once we start Crossing into the halfway point of the discount level, you're too much in a discount to add more to it, which is the reason why you see me do one and done.
*   There it is, I got in, there was no opportunity for me to pyramid, it was just a straight shot 4146, thank you very much, William, bam, thank you, man.

Let me take the annotations off, and you can see.

*   Pay no attention to the fact that the standard deviation one takes us down to that really nice low, but that's just extra, no charge.

Here's the level that's equilibrium.

*   Do you see the volume of balance right here?
*   I've been teaching it that volume imbalance is at equilibrium, and then a very small premium by entry was short, instantly delivered.

This type of movement right here, this, that is exactly what a **low resistance liquidity run** signature performs like.

*   Do you want to be in a move like that, or do you want to be in a move like this, buying down here, hoping it gets to this level up here, buying here, riding it rolls all the way down this deep against you, Rally's okay, it's going to give it to me, it's going to give a take note, the rules back against you, if you put your stuff here, you're just taken out, then it rallies up here, but you've been taken out, but it went to your target?

That still happens to me.

*   If I trade in high resistance liquidity run signatures, I can trade in them, but it doesn't give me peace of mind, I don't want to be in a trade that has this roller coaster back and forth and still gets to where I think it's going to go, there's other days to trade where I won't have that, which is how I teach my students to trade.
*   When we get in, we're looking for very quick responsiveness in price, we want to see instant feedback, we want to see how price goes right to what we're looking for, we don't want to be messing around, we won't be sitting around worrying about twiddling our thumbs, hyperventilating, huffing and puffing, cussing, curse in the market.

### **Past Trading Frustrations**

I've been there, folks, I put my fists through several minders over my career, I've done it, I don't do that anymore.

*   It's boring to me, if I got it wrong, I got it wrong, I'm not going to lose my mind over it, I know what I'm looking for in the future, it will repeat, it just means I've done something incorrect, and I assume that responsibility as a traitor.

But you won't hear that in books.

*   You're going to hear people say push your Edge, don't worry about the drawdown, trade your way out of it, everything that's wrong, that's what's promoted, and there is a logic to look for opportunities that deliver instantaneously, powerfully, energetically, and it repeats over and over and over again.

Look closely, the volume of balance here, why am I even looking at that?

*   Because of everything that is outlined, how fast we move from this high, it's not likely to do what?
*   Come back up to any of this imbalance, it's showing us what? Volume and balance here, a fair that you got another favorite you got another volume and balance that did what?
*   We traded up into it here with that little bit of a wick, and we went down into discount halfway between the high here and target of 4146.

### **Simplifying Complex Concepts**

I know some of you are thinking, okay, this is really complicated ICT, it's not.

*   It's only because you're seeing explained to you for the first time, it gets easier as you see it with me, you start walking through it, and you'll see it's exactly what I'm utilizing, I'm not creating new things each time to keep you from ever learning it.
*   My whole time with you this year is for you to learn this, not hold my hand ICT, I don't want to hold anybody's hand, I got a wife, and that's the only hand I'm trying to hold.

This return back into that volume and balance right there, that's it, that's the last, that's it, that's the last bus stop, and then we're out of here, Elvis left the building.

*   Here we have it delivered right where I said it was going to go when nobody else up here was expecting that price there.

### **Narrative: Sell Short to the Buy Stops**

So, the narrative was run the buy stops, accumulate, that is a short position for smart money, so the composite mean sell short to the buy stops, and buys the sell-side liquidity to cover the short, and the market rallies up to some random level between this candle's low and this candle's high, which is consequent encroachment.

*   That's exactly what you're seeing right here in the market trades lower, so the market trades down to midpoint rally midpoint sloppy sloppy sloppy sloppy, and then between 1050 and 1110 there's going to be a macro.
*   I already know some of you are thinking, okay, but you said at 1050 to 1110 and then there's 11 there's two of them, okay, what can I teach you with Forex? What happens between


Okay, here is the well-structured, readable format of the provided text, retaining every detail, context, and nuance of the original content.

# **Algorithmic Order Flow and Liquidity Runs: A Deep Dive**

## **Time-Based Macros and Order Flow (New York Local Time)**

*   **10:00 AM - 12:00 PM (Noon):** Enclosed order flow. Macros occur during the 10 o'clock and 11 o'clock hours.
*   **12:00 PM - 1:00 PM:** Algorithm runs, returning to morning stop levels.
*   There's a teaching coming in video format to time and date stamp and establish its origin, protecting against others claiming the material.

### **10:50 AM - 11:10 AM Macro Details**

*   This macro makes a run on liquidity that hasn't been taken yet.

**Scenario:**

1.  **Rally:** The market rallies up.
2.  **Breaks Short-Term Low:** Breaks a short-term low, forming relative equal lows.
3.  **Trades Down:** Trades lower, creating a fair value gap.
    *   Specifically, a **sell-side imbalance, buy-side inefficiency (SIBI)** gap.
    *   Lacking delivery on the upside, overshooting the downside.
4.  **Stop Loss Considerations:**
    *   If a small gap exists, stop losses must account for it.
    *   If two fair value gaps are present, the stop loss must respect the higher gap, necessitating less leverage.

**Leverage and Risk Management:**

*   Avoid excessive leverage based solely on funded account allowances.
*   Funded accounts profit from traders' failures.
*   Manage risk responsibly, not maximizing potential gains or leverage.
*   Be wary of influences promoting excessive risk-taking and stacking funded accounts.
*   Greed can lead to repeated account blow-ups and re-ups, benefiting the funded account.
*   With two fair value gaps, use less leverage to respect the stop loss requirements.

**Trading Philosophy:**

*   Focus on consistent risk management and precise execution, not social media bragging rights.
*   Take partials, acknowledging that targets may not always be hit.
*   Progress gradually, mastering each stage (green belt, blue belt, etc.) before aiming for full Terminus holds (black belt).
*   Be content with incremental learning and progress.

**Macro Execution:**

*   The market rallies into a small fair value gap, followed by a move lower.
*   Trades down to the low, potentially returning to the midpoint before breaking lower again.
*   Every London close, between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM, and at noon, algorithmic events occur.
*   Specific details will be provided regarding formation, timing, and days to disregard (trending days).
*   Trending days typically lack macro formations, moving directly "off to the races."

**Potential Trading Model:**

*   These repeating quirky patterns can form the basis of an entire trading model.
*   It is possible to schedule trading down to a 20-minute window.

**Closing Price and Surge:**

*   The market rallies, fails to reach Friday's closing price, and then experiences a significant surge lower.
*   It trades down to a low, aligning with the Fibonacci retracement from the high down to 4146.
*   Sloppy conditions prevail into the afternoon session.

## **Lunch Hour Liquidity Run**

*   If the market has traded lower from a high, the lunch hour will likely involve a run on buy stops.
*   Focus on the high between Friday's close and Sunday's opening.
*   Specifically, the **4146 level**, aligning with the weekly gap opening.
*   The market will likely draw back into that level.
*   Short positions are profitable during this time.

**Stop Loss Placement:**

*   Short traders trail their stop losses to the next relative high.
*   Focus on the most recent high, not necessarily the highest high of the AM session.
*   Consider the worst-case scenario for short traders and where they would logically place their stops.

**Noon Hour Dynamics:**

*   The noon hour begins, focusing on the AM session's buy stops, particularly the most recent high.
*   Between noon and 1:00 PM, a high resistance liquidity run occurs, characterized by roller coaster movements.
*   Ultimately, it targets the AM session's most recent high, where trailed stop losses are likely positioned.
*   This is crucial for understanding market dynamics.

## **Carnivore Trading: Predatory Tactics**

*   Avoid retail-minded theories that are flawed and designed to fail.
*   Be a "carnivore," preying on these flawed retail concepts.
*   Reject the "Judas Theory" of attributing losses to randomness.
*   Recognize that consistent losses stem from being trained to lose.

## **Post-Lunch Analysis and Setups**

*   Buy stops resting above the high are targeted post-lunch, around 1:30 PM.
*   The market runs through this high.
*   The tick high aligns with the candle's opening price, which is the low of the volume imbalance.
*   Consequent encroachment sits just above that, but isn't reasonable if it's going to run there.
*   The market needs to run a bit higher to grab stops
*   Above that high is the volume imbalance, it will hit it, failure.
*   This induces new buyers who perceive the opening gap as a breakout.
*   The market reverts back to the weekly opening gap.

**Large Fund Strategy:**

*   If the market can get back above that opening gap, large funds will buy, expecting continued upward movement.
*   They are buying on a stop, anticipating further gains.

## **Cleaning Up Inefficiencies**

*   The market moves back down into here, cleaning up all this inefficiency.
*   There's sell-side liquidity below, stacked heavily at the AM session low.
*   A small fair value gap exists, and the consequent encroachment of that gap is a notable level.

**Homework Assignment:**

*   Analyze the wick between 4:15 and 4:30.
*   Determine the consequent encroachment level (midpoint of the wick).
*   Extend that level through the fair value gap.
*   This will reveal the precise tick high of the candle before the downward movement.

**Order Flow and Liquidity Dynamics:**

*   The market trades back up into old order flow one more time.
*   A pattern forms: one, two, three, break lower.
*   Below relative equal lows, there's sell-side liquidity.
*   The market rallies up for buy stops, then runs down below these lows.
*   Rallies, someones is going to buy that, they see this is a bull flag.

**Smart Money Positioning:**

*   Smart money sells short to old buy stops, establishing a net short position.
*   It adds to shorts, takes partials, and covers at Terminus below the morning session low.
*   The market engages in choppy behavior, preparing for the next day.

## **Key Takeaways: Opening Gap and Weekly Trend**

*   The opening gap should be extended through the entire week.
*   If the market consistently returns to it and isn't moving decisively away, it's not in a trending model.
*   Trade short-term price approximations, focusing on buy/sell liquidity and inefficiencies.
*   Be nimble, securing profits and avoiding emotional attachment to trades.
*   Avoid assuming intraday trades will evolve into longer-term holds.

**Market Logic and Repetition:**

*   If the market were destined to trend strongly, it wouldn't repeatedly return to the Sunday opening gap.
*   The described logic repeats every week and day, consistently delivering predictable patterns.
*   This codified approach to trading is reliable and repeatable.

**Concluding Remarks:**

*   This level of insight can always be used if you have a foundation of information to back it up.

## **Live Stream Schedule**

*   Check Twitter for updates on whether a live stream will occur tomorrow or Friday.
*   A live stream will definitely happen by Friday if not tomorrow.

Until next time, be safe.

Okay, here's the organized and refined version of the provided text, focusing on clarity, readability, and preservation of all details and nuances.

# Market Analysis and Trading Commentary - [YouTube Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFdWahZUNOw]

## Initial Audio Check and Stream Introduction

*   "Hello, hello, hello. Okay, I can hear myself now." The speaker confirms the audio is working.
*   Acknowledges being "totally new" to live streaming.
*   Intended to do a Twitter Space but is now doing a live stream.
*   Will discuss this morning's market analysis.

## Market Outlook and Target Levels

*   Looking for an opportunity for the market to drop below the **4105.25 level**.
*   **Target projections** from earlier in the stream included **4098.50**.
*   Mentions thinking about **4098.50** approximately two weeks prior.

## Fibonacci Analysis and "Target Shooter" Concept

*   Using a **Fibonacci tool** to measure potential moves.
*   Measuring from a high to a low, with the low acting as a **fulcrum point**.
*   Emphasizes that measuring high to low doesn't guarantee the market will reach that level. The market needs to continuously prove it wants to go lower and break below the fulcrum.
*   The move from the low to the high is treated as a measured move.
*   Attributed the "Target Shooter" concept to **Larry Williams** from a **1995** series.
*   Williams used a transparent plastic piece with lines (one, two, three, four lines, with a line in the middle).
*   The speaker is adapting this with the **Fibonacci tool**.
*   Planning to take another partial profit at a specific level.

## New Week Opening Gap (NWOG) Explanation

*   Referring to the **New Week Opening Gap (NWOG)**.
*   Explains the use of abbreviations to simplify communication and typing during live examples.
*   NWOG definition: Taking a fib and laying it on the low to the high finding **50**, and then from **50** lay a fib there to here, finding **50**. Another way to measure NWOG is to use **25, 50, and 75** Fibonacci levels.
*   The speaker had previously discussed the **NWOG** with his son and annotated a chart accordingly.
*   The original chart included the entire **gradient new week opening gap**.

## Current Trade Management and Mindset

*   Having already hit a target and taken a partial profit.
*   Currently holding **two contracts** remaining.
*   Not necessarily needing to hit **4098.50** or **4099** for a "moral victory".
*   Planning to "eyeball" the midpoint between the current target and the next level.
*   If the market reaches halfway, will close one more contract.
*   **Stop loss** is currently "completely out of mind".
*   Focusing on **price action** due to the "weird, fickle day".

## Addressing Critics and Defining Tape Reading

*   Addressing critics who post after the fact without live examples or executions.
*   Criticizes those who lose large sums on live streams and claim to be mentors.
*   Distinguishes between **tape reading** and simply taking trades.
*   Defines **tape reading** as directing attention to specific **PD arrays** (Premium/Discount arrays) and stating what he wants to see.
*   Clarifies that these aren't necessarily trade recommendations.
*   Admits to taking a losing trade earlier that morning but closing it before a larger stop-out.

## Demo Accounts and Indecisive Market Conditions

*   Recommends using a **demo account**, even when trading with live funds.
*   Suggests demo accounts are helpful when the morning trading session is indecisive.
*   Despite having a bearish bias, he was open to taking a long position up to the **4070.25 level**.
*   He wanted to "nail down the high today" to post it on Twitter.
*   When calling out **PD arrays**, his goal is to focus attention on specific areas.
*   He recognizes that some followers may be tempted to immediately take trades based on his analysis.
*   Emphasizes that the intent is for followers to learn by observing and engaging with the chart.

## Embracing Uncertainty and Avoiding FOMO

*   Encourages embracing uncertainty in trading.
*   Acknowledges his son's perspective of listening to the analysis without seeing the full context.
*   Expresses concern that followers might be prematurely entering trades based on his tweets.
*   Estimates that about **30%** of followers might be attempting to trade based on his calls.
*   Considers breaking his rule and explicitly stating when he is taking a trade.
*   Notes that when he tweeted he was going short, many people seemed to follow ("dog piled").
*   Hopes that his calls have helped followers correct any mistakes they might have made.

## Target Refinement and Risk Management

*   Watching the midpoint between two levels (**4103.25**).
*   If the market touches that, he'll peel off one more contract.
*   He is okay with being wrong and the market going in the opposite direction.
*   Likes the idea that the market traded up into the volume imbalance he mentioned live.
*   Currently in new lows but only has two contracts left.
*   Willing to risk it for a slightly deeper move.
*   "You gotta risk it for the biscuit."
*   "Just a little bit more ICT."

## Addressing a Comment and Age Reference

*   Responding to a comment about "cherry-picked" results.
*   Answering to a comment implying his live stream is not live: "Is it live or is it Memorex?" A cultural reference to advertisements for Memorex tapes.

## Volume Imbalance and Order Flow

*   If he wanted, he can take the profit here.
*   Wants to come in here a little bit tighter and show the volume imbalance.
*   Explains that his Twitter calls are meant to draw attention to specific areas, not necessarily trigger trades.
*   **Order flow** is defined as how price moves from one level to another.
*   He identified the **50% level** between two levels (**4103.25**).
*   The low of the relevant candle was **4103.00**.

## Manual Exits and Precision

*   Explains his preference for manual exits rather than limit orders.
*   Finds it frustrating when limit orders miss his target by a few ticks.
*   Treats manual exits like a timing game, aiming for positive slippage.
*   Compares it to a Chuck E. Cheese game where you try to hit a target at the right moment.
*   While some exits are satisfactory, most are not.
*   He is striving for the best execution of a perfect trade, which is unachievable, but worth pursuing.
*   The goal is to continuously improve the skill set.

## Level Analysis and Future Expectations

*   If he had more than one contract, he could have taken off one more as it hit the low (**4103.00**).
*   Discusses the significance of wicks at the **4103.00** level.
*   Doesn't want to see the market trade back up into that area.
*   Wants it to remain heavy, acting as a balanced price range.
*   If it trades back up, it would likely lead to a deeper retracement and a move towards his target.


Okay, here's the organized and refined version of the provided text, focusing on clarity, readability, and preservation of all details and nuances.

# Market Analysis and Trading Commentary

## Understanding PD Arrays and Market Interpretation

*   When calling out **PD arrays** (Premium/Discount arrays), specific **fair value gaps**, and **volume imbalances**, the speaker states what he'd like to see the market do.
*   It is emphasized that these calls are not trade entries.
*   The speaker critiques individuals ("goober", "Mr. talker") who claim expertise but repeatedly fail in trading (e.g., "blow out three times in Robin's cup").
*   Whenever a **PD array** is mentioned, it is intended as a reference point.
*   Referencing a previous market review, the speaker highlights the importance of observing price reaction.
*   The goal is to gauge whether price respects the identified **PD array**.
*   If price trades through a **PD array**, the speaker doesn't react negatively but uses it as insight.
*   If price breaks through multiple **PD arrays**, it suggests the speaker's interpretation of **order flow** may be inaccurate.
*   In such cases, the speaker may neutralize a trade (as done earlier that day) to avoid hitting a stop loss.
*   The speaker mentions that the market is trading up into an area that he didn't want to see it trade into.
*   Focusing on the mean threshold of a specific candle (an up-close candle), identified as **4107.50**.
*   If price goes through **4107.50**, the speaker is likely to close the trade and accept the outcome.

## Addressing Trading Challenges and Exit Strategies

*   The speaker acknowledges challenges faced as a trader, particularly regarding desired outcomes at exits.
*   He addresses the scenario where price hits a target level and continues moving lower.
*   The speaker focuses on managing trades and aiming for precise levels for closing trades.
*   This approach stems from a rule that has proven more beneficial than trying to "finesse" exit strategies.
*   The speaker is pursuing perfection in his exit strategies.
*   If the market goes through the mean threshold, he would close the trade.
*   The speaker describes a scenario where he would have discounted the idea and sat through it. The market would move in the other direction, and he would be upset with himself.
*   Closing the trade is based on criteria indicating a diminished likelihood of reaching objectives.
*   He acknowledges instances where deviating from this rule has resulted in negative outcomes.
*   The speaker notes the market might hit the **4098.50** level.

## Interpreting Price Action and Identifying Patterns

*   Reading and interpreting individual **PD arrays** can be done without relying on depth of market tools (e.g., ladders, volume profile).
*   The key is to observe whether price consistently encounters resistance in the form of **PD arrays**.
*   The **PD arrays** are used to key up a new trade.
*   The speaker clarifies that he is not necessarily taking or entering on a trade when he mentions a **PD Array**.
*   Referring to a previously mentioned volume imbalance, the speaker clarifies he didn't explicitly suggest going short.
*   The speaker teaches viewers to observe how price reacts to specific elements of price action.
*   The reason for teaching this approach is to allow viewers to discover their preferred models and approaches.
*   The speaker recognizes that individuals will gravitate towards different **PD arrays** based on their preferences.
* The speaker mentions that fair value gap is a popular pattern, however viewers may prefer a volume imbalance.
*   The speaker emphasizes the importance of real-time identification of these patterns, either through live analysis or his Twitter feed.
*   Calling out specific candles is not an invitation to buy or sell.
*   He clarifies that he openly communicates when he is taking a trade.

## Personalization and Mentorship in Trading

*   By watching price and observing these elements of price action, viewers can learn.
*   Watching price action will allow you to see if the **PD arrays** are repeating.
*   The speaker mentions that if he refers to himself when he is mentioning that he knows that the viewer will recognize that the viewer has been paying attention.
*   The speaker advocates for a personalized approach to trading, encouraging individuals to incorporate their own observations and preferences.
*   He believes this approach is more effective than a dogmatic one.
*   The speaker aims to provide a mentorship that allows students to discover themselves within the framework of the concepts taught.
*   The speaker wants to give his students the opportunity to bring something of their own personality and internalization of price action.
*   There are many different ways to trade the concepts that he teaches, and the students can have completely unique models using the same information.
*   He contrasts his approach with mentors who simply encourage copying their methods.
*   The speaker references advertisements for trading schemes promising funded accounts or signals.

## Live Streaming and Market Review

*   The speaker notes that every individual **PD array** called out this morning is a skill set for the viewer to look for.
*   The speaker mentions times when he will not be live streaming or on Twitter.
*   The speaker states that he didn't want to live stream today due to not feeling well.
*   He explains that Friday is the next day, and he does not want to miss the second live stream that he promised this week.
*   Because of this, the speaker will incorporate a little bit of a review in this live stream.
*   The speaker suggests engaging in live **tape reading** during periods when he's not actively sharing insights on Twitter or live streams.
*   If live **tape reading** isn't possible, he recommends using old data preferably recorded live.
*   The speaker notes that Market Replay is unfortunate, because it is not the same as watching the candle form.
*   **Market Replay** only shows two fluctuations per candle on trading view, which to him is "next to nothing".
*   He recommends recording your screen and letting the chart paint while you are away.
*   Then the viewer can come back and study the chart at real time, pause it when something is seen, screenshot it, and annotate it.
*   The speaker then recommends using **OBS** (Open Broadcaster Software) for screen recording, noting its popularity and ease of use.
*   He suggests setting up charts to record and reviewing them during weekends.
*   He then uses a metaphor of people wasting their time watching sports on the weekend.

## Applying Trading Concepts and Identifying Market Imbalances

*   Referencing a specific area on the chart, he points out a remaining balance of a gap between a high and a low.
*   He uses the following analogy for illustrating the concept of fair value gaps:

    *   Imagine price is going down to the **4103** level.
    *   You see a price trading up into this fair value gap.
    *   Illustrates a candle's low, a candle's high, and the next candle passing through between the previous candles low and the next candle is high with no overlap.
    *   The fair value gap is like a paint roller applying paint to a wall.

*   Illustrates a candle's low, a candle's high, and the next candle passing through between the previous candles low and the next candle is high with no overlap.
*   Uses an analogy of a painter using a paint roller to apply paint to a wall.
*   The area with the gap is like a pocket where the paint wasn't evenly distributed.
*   When the roller applies paint to the wall, the paint is thick, but eventually small porous pockets appear where paint didn't distribute.
*   In an ideal world, the painter would apply more paint to the roller and roll back up over this area.
*   The speaker states that this analogy would have made more sense than overbought, swing highs, divergence, trend lines, or moving averages.
*   The speaker mentions he wants to be looking at where the market can go back in and replenish paint to the canvas.
*   The algorithm will want to go down to that area, but it has to deliver the market efficiently otherwise it's a straight line like **CPI** (Consumer Price Index).
*   **CPI** is an absolute freight train coming to hit you, and it will drag you for miles.


Okay, here's the organized and refined version of the provided text, focusing on clarity, readability, and preservation of all details and nuances.

# Market Analysis and Trading Concepts Explained

## Understanding Price Action and Market Dynamics

*   The speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding **where price is going to go**. This is likened to a painter needing to know where to start on a wall, be it the left, top, or bottom. This starting point is the **point of inception** for applying paint.
*   Once the paint is applied, the painter's job is to cover the entire surface.
*   The speaker uses the analogy of watching a painter use a paint roller on YouTube to illustrate this concept.
*   Imagine starting on a wall in the lower right-hand corner, or alternatively at the top. Applying the roller and dragging it down results in a **thick and even delivery of paint** for the first 12-20 inches, **without pockets or porous areas**.
*   The painter continues rolling until they feel like they're not getting any more paint.
*   The painter then rolls back over the same pathway to gather excessive amounts of paint and evenly distribute it, filling in any pockets where paint hasn't been distributed.
*   This **reapplication in old areas** is analogous to price action.

## Inefficiencies in Price Delivery

*   In the context of price action: In a particular area, price was offered in both directions from a candle's high and low.
*   The next candle opens, trades down, and runs over the previous candle's low, then rallies back up, leaving a **hole or pocket** where price didn't go back over.
*   The hole left behind is an **inefficiency**.
*   This occurs because price operates on a **price continuum**, specifically an **efficiency continuum**, meaning the market must continuously offer fair value.
*   Whenever it creates an inefficiency, it seeks to correct it.
*   The market will **over-deliver**, just like a painter overlaps strokes with a paint roller.
*   You can't paint a wall with separate, non-overlapping strokes; you have to overlap to avoid seams.
*   This overlapping is exactly what occurs in price action.
*   Look at the range between a candle's high and low: The market trades down and up within that range.
*   On a micro scale, this is a small balanced price range.

## Fair Value Gaps and Algorithmic Efficiency

*   When the bodies of candles come back into a **fair value gap**, specifically in the highlighted area, observe where the bodies stop.
*   For example, the closing price on one candle is **4116.75**, and the low of the next candle is also **4116.75**.
*   The speaker describes this specific matching of candle closing prices and lows or open prices as **perfect**, a **signature** that shows the Market's **algorithmic retail logic**.
*   No one explicitly teaches trading with levels like this, nor do they provide precise levels for drawing trend lines.
*   The speaker contrasts this with a hypothetical scenario where a thousand traders are asked to draw a trend line on the same chart; they would all draw it differently.
*   This inconsistency is why retail traders struggle, as they lack a consistent premise.
*   The speaker's approach is based on **rigid, rule-based ideas centered around PD arrays**, within the context of market structure, a bias derived from narrative, and a higher timeframe premise (weekly chart).
*   The speaker does the same things constantly, but with very specific levels, such as knowing that the low of a candle, **4116.75**, agrees with the closing price of another candle.

## Overlapping Price Action and Identifying Market Structure

*   Just like a paint roller delivers over old areas, watch how the painter overlaps to ensure there are no seams.
*   This buttons everything up, smoothing out and feathering the edge of an old run of paint.
*   Similarly, when cutting grass, you overlap the mower to avoid wasting time going back over missed spots.
*   The algorithm is coded to efficiently reprice, so you'll see these small areas where the market returns.
*   The speaker highlights a specific area defined by a candle's low and high, where price has passed back and forth in both directions.
*   When price passes back into the **fair value gap** defined by that low to high range, the speaker's eye is trained to look for that, and he teaches his students to do the same.
*   You can try to enter short at the candle's high or the midpoint, aiming for precision. However, the speaker notes that attempting to get a fill at the high often fails, leaving a small portion open.
*   What is illustrated here is the efficiency of the algorithm coming back into an area that's already balanced, covering up and overlapping an area where it's already traded.
*   That's not an error or a deficiency in precision; it's simply ensuring there are no seams.
*   The bodies of the candles tell the real story; that's where the damage is done, not the wicks.
*   The real narrative is in the bodies of the candles.
*   You must accept that your trades will have that much drawdown if you're entering in **consequent encroachment**.

## Time-Based Charts and Retail Logic

*   In the example range, price is balanced, having made passes in both directions.
*   The candle went down to the low, and the next candle opened and went up.
*   The speaker is focusing on the difference between the candle's low and high, presenting a range of price action that, in a four-minute interval (each candle being two minutes), sees price going back and forth.
*   The speaker disputes the notion that lower timeframe charts are "noise." They are telling you what price is doing.
*   Whether you're looking at this chart timeframe or an hourly or daily chart, price is doing the same thing.
*   If you watch price on a daily candlestick from 9:30 to 5:00, it's doing the same thing as on the lower timeframe charts.
*   Some will say that time-based charts don't work, and that's true if you trade retail logic.
*   The speaker is teaching how to use time-based theory to identify what the market algorithm is doing.
*   There is only one algorithm, the price engine that delivers this.
*   The speaker rejects the idea that market movements are simply the result of coincidental buying and selling pressure from retail traders.
*   The speaker immediately mutes those who make such comments because he finds it triggering to see people deny the evidence.

## Fair Value Gaps and Market Overlap

*   The speaker then mentions: We had this overlapping into this area.
*   What is this entire range from this low to this high right there? There is our **fair value gap**.
*   If you know that the algorithm is going to do the same thing you're going to do when you cut your lawn, overlapping the mower to prevent seams, you understand the market better.
*   He then gives an analogy: You are going to go out there with your mower, or the guy that you're going to hire to cut your grass for you like I do because I ain't cutting the overlapping of that mower where you just pass through, you know cutting the grass down the first pass then you're going to turn the mower around and they're going to lay their wheel over top of what was already cut so that way there's no seam right so when you make a new pass you're always cutting through cutting through and not leaving that little segment of grass where you got to go oh I left a mohawk got to go back in here my sons the few times I've asked them to do the lawn they hate it because they know my obsessive compulsiveness is gonna force me to go to the window and see what they're doing and I'm waiting for them to leave a little Mohawk in the grass and as soon as I see it I'm out there hey hey go back and get that and they flip out because they thought they were going to get away with it but you can see it you can see it in the grass you don't want to leave that so that's what these little things are here preventing any little Mohawks in the lawn
*   These small market overlaps prevent "Mohawks in the lawn," ensuring efficient repricing.
*   If that balanced price range between a candle's low and high is your target, that's good.
*   That range gives you a midpoint level that is the **mean threshold**.
*   If it were a gap, like the **fair value gap**, the midpoint is **consequent encroachment**, which is what's permissible within a range.
*   The speaker recalls: "Let's see if we get that 98 50 level I mentioned on Twitter because I feel like a peacock if it hits that my wife is going to see me doing the Mick Jagger walk got my moves like Jagger".
*   The speaker then follows up by saying: "Don't worry I'll come back up to that balance price range in a moment some of you already figured out what I'm going to go and talk about in a second".

## Consequent Encroachment and Market Faith

*   The speaker mentions: Over here we have **4117.50**. It just so happens randomly with buying and selling pressure being as it is completely random how far can it overshoot this fair value Gap.
*   The question then is: what's the midpoint between this candle's low and this candle is high for that balanced price range **4117.50** what's the high on this candle right there four thousand one hundred Seventeen point five zero.
*   It takes more of a "religious faith-based Madness" to believe that all these things the speaker is teaching, and telling viewers to look for in the market, keep happening by chance.
*   He shares: These are the things I was sitting in my aunt's bedroom after working 13 and a half hours a day doing a 45-minute commute in 20 minutes speeding I guess I was breaking the law never wore seat belts either and I rarely wear one still today but I'm a rebel I would sit in there and I'd look at these charts and I started looking at these things and these turning points and I'm like what happens continuously all the time at these turning points and I started seeing this in the bond market in the s p Market and then I said well let me see if it occurs in the currency futures it was it's there so I said okay I need to know I need to know did I see something I'm not supposed to see.
*   The speaker states that they took all of my money every time I made new money I would buy more books and more courses and more books and more courses.
*   The speaker mentions: and for the yahoos out there that say that I have rebranded things old terminology rebranded with new terms this stuff is in notebooks no other author ever talked about it it's never been touched on until I've said it which is the reason why I challenge every one of my viewers unless it's going to hit our Target here I Told You So moments oh look at that so Random acceleration down I told you we'd probably get a big down day earlier in the day if we get through that uh new week opening Gap.

## Teaching and Personal Struggles

*   The speaker then mentions: So I had a lot of fun I'm not I'm not beating my chest I'm just thumbing my nose at the people that like to say I can't do this that these things don't work and it's cherry-picked and I have a small win when I had the win of the day I called everything you've seen it it's here again I want you to learn but if you can't get out of your way of your own ego and your pride because you don't know this and you can't do it yet and I'm probably killing your business because you can't sell your stuff anymore and you're getting on your live streams and losing fifteen thousand dollars of fake money but calling it live I get it it's a struggle point for you but I'm not trying to be your adversary just learn from me you don't ever have to mention.


Okay, here's the organized and refined version of the provided text, focusing on clarity, readability, and preservation of all details and nuances.

# Market Analysis and Trading Concepts Explained (Continued)

## Supporting Student Success and Addressing Market Dynamics

*   The speaker reiterates that they want to see students succeed and avoid harm in the markets.
*   The speaker highlights the non-random nature of the markets.
*   The speaker directs the attention back to the balanced price range, indicating they will revisit it later.
*   There's an acknowledgement of opinions that the speaker should not have closed a trade when they did, but suggests there's a lesson to be learned.
*   The speaker refers to the price action nailing a level perfectly, moving lower, and then trading to an area above it once more, ensuring "no Mohawks in the lawn," meaning it's seamless.
*   The price then breaks lower and trades up again, moving into the **consequent encroachment** of a gap's midpoint.
*   The speaker suggests that this touching of the midpoint might be the last time it happens.
*   This is because price has already moved to the midpoint, and the levels that the speaker is expecting and looking for are the areas that price is going to be drawn to.
*   The speaker draws an analogy to cutting a lawn: once you start mowing, you continue until you reach the end.
*   Similarly, one must keep applying paint to the wall or pushing the mower until completion, which is defined by time and price.

## Market Objectives and Price Efficiency

*   The speaker mentions that it's the last hour of trading (3 o'clock hour), and the market is delivering into their objectives, specifically one given on Twitter.
*   The speaker observes that the price went past the given objective, and that that is okay with him.
*   The speaker anticipates that when the price goes up into a certain level, it will never go back up there.
*   It is permissible for the price to re-enter a fair value gap because it is an old inefficiency in price.
*   However, the difference between a specific candle's low and another candle's high is efficient because it has traded in both directions.
*   This creates balance in order flow and price delivery.
*   **Price delivery** is defined as every new price tick and fluctuation in price action, representing a new valuation of an asset.
*   The speaker describes measuring how often the delivery of price occurs within a specific range and timeframe (two specific candles).
*   A specific candle's high is noted as **4118.25**, and another candle's low is **4116.75**.
*   The price went down and then up within those price points.
*   The speaker considers the entire range between the candle's high and low to be balanced.
*   It's normal for price to move back up into the midpoint of that range, which the speaker allows for in their analysis.
*   It's rare for the price to go all the way back up to the top of a balanced price range.
*   If it does, the speaker will probably exit the trade.

## PD Arrays and Algorithmic Signatures

*   The speaker treats PD arrays as support and resistance, but notes that the common ways of using support and resistance don't work correctly.
*   The speaker states that the algorithm goes into specific signatures and price actions that cannot be hidden.
*   The speaker jokingly mentions that market makers can't simply turn off candlesticks.
*   The speaker likens it to stopping using a clock, which is presented as absurd.
*   The speaker identifies time as the primary function of price action.
*   Price does things at specific times, and then it delivers price based on efficiency and the price delivery continuum.
*   The market must continuously offer fair value.
*   If the market moves too quickly in one direction, leaving a separation between a candle's low and another candle's high, there's no overlap, creating a "porous price action hole."
*   The speaker emphasizes that this hole needs to be filled.
*   The speaker uses an analogy of a pothole on the road, where a damaged car owner would contact the state to fix it.
*   The speaker jokingly mentions that his wife sees his trading as a video game.
*   The **fair value gap** can be revisited entirely.
*   The wicks trade up into the same old inefficiency.
*   This is a **reclaimed fair value gap**, meaning price went back to it and is respecting it like a resistance level.

## Market Retracements and PD Array Characteristics

*   The speaker conveys that one should not be alarmed when the market rallies back to these areas.
*   The balanced price range behind the fair value gap is the "defender" or "linebacker" of price action, acting as an "Iron Wall."
*   Retracements back into a fair value gap are reasonable.
*   The speaker's experience and explanations will demonstrate this.
*   Sometimes price will move through the fair value gap, which the speaker experienced that morning.
*   There was nothing in there for a trade until a fair value was retraded.
*   The speaker attempted a trade that wasn't working and had to exit, potentially stopping out.
*   This is an example of human error in interpreting price and objectives while teaching.
*   The speaker asserts that viewers will learn the characteristics of PD arrays as they observe them.
*   The speaker describes some common behaviors when people watch their videos:
    *   They are not interested in expounding on the logic required to understand the concepts.
    *   If someone is lazy, they will not learn this approach.
*   The speaker encourages those who are offended by this to unsubscribe.
*   The speaker stresses that there are no shortcuts to learning this, and one must study charts, backtest, and tape read for months.
*   The speaker notes that those who simply push buttons to enter trades will fail because they aren't getting the same type of feedback and insight as those who study the market deeply.

## Volume Imbalances and Market Perfection

*   The speaker emphasizes that they have been consistently calling out specific market phenomena.
*   He references an example of calling out to "watch this volume imbalance here" and observing it deliver to the candle's closing price.
*   The candle's closing price was **4111.75**, and the high of the candle was also **4111.75**.
*   The speaker dismisses "Mickey Mouse supply and demand" concepts.
*   The speaker shares anecdotes of students' reactions when witnessing these concepts in action on bond and S\&P charts, often expressing surprise and disbelief at the apparent perfection.
*   The speaker suggests that if the markets were truly designed for the betterment of investors, they would exhibit similar patterns.
*   However, the speaker states the markets are often treated like a casino.
*   The speaker notes that casinos often have no windows or clocks to make people lose track of time and money.

## Indicators and Hiding in Plain Sight

*   The speaker believes the way they hide this stuff in plain sight is through indicators.
*   The speaker notes how they are always pushing what a new round of indicators.
*   The speaker claims that they are already starting to do it with his stuff like Fair Value Gap Indicator.
*   The speaker claims that it will not bring in the most important criteria to that, so you will lose money and say he is a scammer.
*   The speaker claims he is doing it live and calling it.
*   The speaker claims that people that are learning are excited because they are seeing evidence.
*   The speaker notes that even facetiously said oh you are going to tell me that small little range yes and what does it do it overshoots it so why there's no Mohawks in the lawn over suits a little bit so it's seamless then it does what comes right back up.
*   The speaker asks what the close is but then changes to the low of this candle here that frames the high of the volume imbalance.
*   The speaker said that he loves them too and they should be thankful that they sat down and listened.
*   The speaker states that the low of the candle is 4109.25.

## Market Objectives and Personal Philosophy

*   The speaker points out that the low of that candle (4109.25) equals the high of the relevant candle, which is a perfect alignment that he predicted.
*   He reiterates that this was not a deleted tweet or an incorrect call, but an exact prediction.
*   The speaker refers to unrealized objectives at 4101.25 and 4098.50 (mentioned on Twitter).
*   The speaker states that he doesn't care if it went further and has no regret missing a move.
*   The speaker claims that if you know what I am teaching you and I know it.
*   The speaker mentions that the sun might not come up tomorrow, but he is always ready.
*   The speaker notes if the Market is going to open tomorrow he will see these things occurring in price action.
*   The speaker emphasizes that these patterns cannot be hidden, assuring listeners they shouldn't worry about his algorithm being changed.
*   The speaker claims that his flesh The Sinner in me would keep it to myself if he thought it would be changed or augmented by sharing openly like this.
*   The speaker thinks that you are wasting time worrying about stuff that has no bearing on your development and providing perfect excuses for you not to even start.
*   The speaker refers to one of the soundclouds he did are you deserving because some of you probably don't believe that you are and that is going to be a amazing barrier to you ever getting good at this no matter who you learn from whatever style or approach the trading you don't want to fail a deep-rooted fear of failing so you will make perfect excuses to justify why you're not going to try hard.
*   The speaker believes people say I am just never gonna be able to do it I won't be able to follow the rules so why bother I just might as well call it a scam he's a scammer he's never gonna live stream.
*   The speaker claims that he is doing it now I am calling it I am telling you I am on Twitter and I am telling you here come on wake up man you're gonna burn through this whole entire year and waste this opportunity.

## Trading Models and Draw on Liquidity

*   The speaker suggests to look at the last hour of the day through the lens of your trading model from three o'clock to four o'clock New York local time.
*   The speaker claims that you have to understand where the Market is likely to go.
*   The speaker mentions that the draw on liquidity is the number one thing as a Trader.
*   The speaker forces his students to learn you may not be good at it quickly and that is the reason why I teach that premise first because if you start working on that as your first hurdle that is the first thing you are trying to learn and you are doing it correctly by time devotion doing it over and over again the other skill sets are which are very easy which are entering which sounds crazy because you heard me say multiple times now my my hard part about trading was what Conquering the fear of getting in now my strength is getting in like I just I mean I could have said all this stuff and been wrong.
*   The speaker claims that he is on live stream and out here without a safety net and the market makers can hear and see me and they know me do you see them crash in the market because I said it no manual intervention is always a risk that means something is going to happen that you didn't expect some Black Swan event and boom marxist is gonna go crazy.
*   The speaker expects that in 4X soon that is why I am not trading Forex.
*   The speaker is trying to be a good Steward with this information and also be a good human being because I feel that that is exactly what is about to happen.
*   The speaker said that you are going to trade whatever you are going to trade I understand that but it would be unethical for me.


Okay, here is the refined and organized version of the provided text.

# Market Analysis and Trading Concepts Explained (Continued)

## Risk Disclosure and Forex Warning

*   The speaker emphasizes that they have warned listeners and have a clear conscience.
*   If listeners choose to trade Forex and "get burned," the speaker does not want to receive complaints, as they have issued multiple warnings.
*   The speaker believes a damaging event, similar to the Euro/Swiss depeg, is coming soon in Forex.
    *   The speaker does not provide a specific timeline.
    *   The speaker wants listeners to avoid being hurt in those markets.
*   While losses can occur in any market, the speaker anticipates a Forex move with greater magnitude, speed, and velocity than other markets.
*   The speaker advises listeners to research the Euro/Swiss depegging event.
    *   Brokerages were shut down and became insolvent instantly.
    *   Such moves are unsurvivable.
*   The speaker is sharing this information to help listeners prepare and avoid harm.

## Market Analysis and 4088 Level

*   The speaker mentions the **4088** level as the next one of interest, noting that he was expecting it to be reached the following day.

## Tom Hougaard and Market Commentary

*   The speaker enjoys listening to **Tom Hougaard**, comparing his voice to **Arnold Schwarzenegger**.
*   Hougaard is usually sophisticated and articulate, but he became particularly animated on one occasion.
*   The speaker found Hougaard's animation funny, clarifying that he was laughing *with* him, not *at* him.
*   Hougaard’s presentation was referencing the speaker's comments about a "shitty" morning market session.

## Focusing on the Last Hour Trader

*   The speaker states **4088** was the level, and the listener should look at his chart and find that for his homework.
*   The speaker notes the higher time frame chart will help you.
*   For traders focused on the last hour, the speaker advises against trying to trade at the beginning of the day (9:30 AM).
*   Last hour traders should not try to guess the range or be concerned with the "Judas swing."
*   They shouldn't panic about missed opportunities or have any fear over it.
*   Instead, they should wait for the afternoon session.

## Afternoon Trading Session

*   If trading the afternoon session, focus on the market from 1:30 PM onwards.
*   Specifically, pay attention to the last hour, from 4:00 to 4:15 PM.
*   Trading continues until 5:00 PM, followed by an hour closure until 6:00 PM.
*   The speaker states that, personally, they would be done if the price were to “rip” through the 4088 level.
*   He emphasizes that taking all positions off at this point would be his approach, which he'd be content with it.

## Benefits of Concentrated Trading

*   The 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM hour provides a small, concise, and encapsulated data set.
*   This allows traders to benefit from what has already happened during the day.
*   Similar to Forex, where traders focus on the New York session to leverage London's activity.
*   Knowing the market's likely direction on a higher timeframe helps avoid whipsaws and premature entries.

## Understanding Market Dynamics

*   The last hour of trading provides the advantage of hindsight from the morning session.
*   Manipulation against the stops of the morning session often occurs between noon and 1:45 PM.
*   Traders should watch price around 1:30 PM in anticipation of afternoon trading.
*   For those with limited time, start chart analysis around 2:45 PM.
*   In those 15 minutes, a trader should look to see what has been done and what is being reached for.

## Draw on Liquidity and PD Arrays

*   The speaker emphasizes the need to understand where the "draw on liquidity" is.
*   Identify the overwhelming magnet or target price on daily, four-hour, and one-hour charts.
*   Determine the higher probability draws on liquidity and the direction of movement using a weekly chart.
*   Focus on PD arrays (Fair Value Gaps, Order Blocks, etc.) that resonate most.
*   The speaker highlights the inevitability of missing trades when specific PD arrays do not form.

## Live Market Analysis and Volume Imbalance

*   The speaker states that they are performing live analysis and wants viewers to learn from it.
*   The speaker referred to calling out to watch a volume imbalance.
*   He references an example of calling out to "watch this volume imbalance here" and observing it deliver to the candle's closing price.
*   Delivery occurred perfectly to the candle's closing price.
*   The speaker states they facetiously said there's no way the market would care about this tiny range.
*   The speaker asserts that an algorithm exists, whether listeners believe it or not.
*   The speaker claims that it could be proven in front of anyone every day.
*   The speaker attributes the inability to see these patterns to the distraction of indicators (RSI, etc.)
*   He claims that those indicators are a misdirection and one can't see the "magic" because of it.
*   The speaker likens it to a magician showing misdirection in one hand when the magic is done with another.
*   The speaker claims this has been occurring for a long time and to look at charts from 1930s.

## Historical Market Manipulation

*   The speaker discusses the historical context of market manipulation, even before the existence of algorithms.
*   The speaker promises to reveal more about this later in the year, introducing a "Mr. Smith."

## Volume Imbalance and Market Structure

*   The run-up into the volume imbalance starts the "show."
*   The speaker questions what happens when the market respects that level and repels price away.
*   The speaker mentions needing to remove something from the presentation to be able to zoom in to talk about this.
*   The speaker believes enough has been proven, and viewers can watch **Carl's Futures** introductory course on YouTube.
*   After the swing low is taken, a fair value gap is noted.
*   The speaker states it is not needed for price to close below the swing low.
*   The speaker notes one only needs to wait for this swing low.

## Trading Strategy and Expectations

*   The speaker emphasizes the importance of knowing what he teaches regarding the market structure shift.
*   The speaker expects the price to gravitate lower towards 4098.50 or 4098.25 (a previously shared target on Twitter).
*   The speaker was expecting a large range day, confirming that the new week opening gap was delivered.
*   He held a majority of the position open the entire day but missed a significant run-off.
*   The speaker then outlines where those signals were in front of the listener.

## Perfect Delivery and Algorithmic Precision

*   Price trades up into the volume imbalance and creates a swing low.
*   The price rallies up and hits it one more time and then the candle high is **4109.00**
*   The speaker said let that sink in and do you believe people were teaching this.
*   The speaker claims it did not ever happen before him.
*   The speaker claims that some big name authors have been talking to him in private for 3 and a half years to 4 years now.
*   The speaker claims that there will be future books, but it was never mentioned before him.
*   The speaker claims it matters to him.
*   The speaker said this is a source of intention with me being a mentor and constantly repeating it.
*   The speaker claims that this is like a nervous tick in me.
*   The speaker wants everyone to get over it because he will never stop.
*   The speaker describes that when we trade up into that volume imbalance and we want to see it respect it and repel the price away.
*   The speaker states that when that candle closes and the next one opens, we're looking for no return to where they removed any "Mohawk in the lawn."
*   While going above the candle's high is not permissible, encroachment into a fair value gap is acceptable.

## Building Barriers and Trusting the Algorithm

*   The speaker explains how the market builds barriers.
*   The speaker claims that people are worrying about other things instead of taking notes.
*   The speaker states he is like a fire hose and doesn't know what he has said after he said it.
*   The speaker emphasizes the logic will be different but because it is in his nature to ramble.

## Turning Points and Market Structure Shifts

*   The turning point is confirmed when the candle fails to make a higher high.
*   The turning point doesn't have to touch back into that volume of balance.
*   The candle's low is taken out.
*   This is going to act in much the same way as the candle being pierced.
*   It's like a small little shift in Market structure.
*   It's an early confirmation that this is most likely going to get tripped, preparing you to get ready.
*   This candle drops below this low, and the speaker is looking for this low to be pierced.
*   We now have a valid shift in Market structure with this low being taken there.
*   The speaker frames this as a fair value gap but you don't know when this candle opens and how it closes that creates this volume imbalance.
*   The speaker is going to use this volume imbalance on this candle here if it opens here.
*   The speaker claims as soon as it rallies up into that between this candle's open and this candle is closed and it trades there and right then and there while that candle is bullish, it is going short right in there.
*   That is the entry technique.
*   The speaker claims he is selling short in up candles and pyramiding entries when bearish in up close candles when the candle is forming going up and he is selling into that.
*   The speaker says that you have to know those PD arrays he is teaching to observe and study and you don't know which one you are going to.


Okay, here is the refined and organized version of the provided text.

# Trust, PD Arrays, and Market Analysis: A Deep Dive

## Trusting Your Analysis

*   The speaker expresses trust in their own analysis, stating, "I trust all of them, they're mine."
*   The speaker is often asked how they trust certain things and what they look for in PD arrays.
*   The speaker says when they take the time to respond they ask which one the person is using, and it's crickets.
*   This is attributed to a lack of personal work and real-time data analysis.

## The Importance of Work Ethic and Real-Time Data

*   The speaker emphasizes the importance of analyzing real-time data to determine preferred PD arrays.
*   Traders need to be content with the idea that *not every* price run will have their specific PD array.
    *   This teaches patience and selective trading.
    *   It prevents over-indulgence, a common problem in the industry.

## Dangers of Over-Leverage and Pyramid Schemes

*   The speaker warns about over-indulgence, stating that a high success rate can be undone by excessive leverage.
*   A trader can have a 90% strike rate, and blow their account on *one* trade.
*   Overzealous pyramiding and building up a large position can lead to blowing out.
*   The speaker references a "talker" on YouTube who frequently loses significant amounts of money (e.g., $15,000-$16,000) while live streaming due to uncontrolled pyramiding.
*   The speaker does not know if its even real.

## Focusing on a Specific PD Array

*   Traders should focus on a specific PD array and master it, making it their model.
*   It's important to be comfortable with that PD array not always being present in every price run.
*   This selective approach is a sign of growth, not a limitation.

## Observing Price Action and Personal Preference

*   The speaker emphasizes watching price action without impulsively trading.
*   Acknowledging that not everyone will find every setup appealing or effective.
*   An example is given: a trader might not see a specific setup as a sell, which is fine, because different traders will resonate with different PD arrays.
    *   One trader might prefer a fair value gap setup and miss other opportunities.

## The Market Coming to You

*   The speaker looks for very specific levels and waits for the market to come to them.
*   If the market doesn't reach their desired level, they miss the move.
*   The trader should not trade outside of a pre-defined PD array matrix.
*   Entries should be made at or above certain levels when shorting, or below when longing.

## Limitations and Criteria

*   For new listeners: the speaker acknowledges some of this may not make sense.
*   Having limitations on when to stop taking entries is crucial.
*   Criteria for stopping adding to pyramid positions is key to avoid treating every movement as a reason to enter.
*   This lesson was learned "the hard way."

## Inverted Pyramids and Position Sizing

*   The speaker recounts learning from an inverted pyramid strategy: starting with one contract, then two, then four, and so on.
*   The speaker then says that the size of the position was exponentially higher.
*   The problem was that small retracements wiped out entire runs of open profits.
*   This highlights the importance of weighing out position sizing and risk.

## Starting at Square One

*   The speaker acknowledges the enthusiasm for running up accounts and seeing massive equity increases.
*   However, they insist on starting at the basics.

## Live Market Analysis: A Detailed Example

*   The speaker analyzes a specific market movement.
*   The low for the day was at 4078.25 after a selloff.

### Original Entry and Adding to the Position
*   The speaker's original entry would be when the market pierces a low.
*   If the market traded up into a fair value gap, they would add to the position.
*   They clarify that they're building a position within a small segment of price action below an area where they believe the price won't return (based on volume imbalance).

### Position Sizing in the Example
*   If initially entering with six contracts on the volume imbalance, they would add three contracts in the fair value gap area, cutting the original position size and leverage in half.

### Market Structure and Consequent Encroachment
*   After the market breaks down and retraces, the speaker wants to see an immediate overlap of the wick.
*   The speaker says if its not in real time you can't really use this technique because you need to see price move in real-time.
*   The speaker does not want the candle to open, come back down, flirt with the midpoint, and then rally back up.
    *   Because if the conditions were met it could do it there and there the fair value gap.
*   If that occurred, they might add one contract, hoping the volume imbalance isn't revisited and they don't get stopped out.
*   This trust in experience comes from repeated observation of market logic.

### Candle Delivery and Consequent Encroachment (4100.75)

*   The candle opens, delivers, and re-delivers the entire range of the wick.
*   The speaker points out an area of value at 4100.75 as consequent encroachment.
*   The speaker finds a candle closes at the level of consequent encroachment.
*   The speaker then says it opens at the same level.
*   The speaker emphasizes the seemingly small detail and how it can get overlooked.

### The Algorithmic "Seamlessness"
*   The speaker emphasizes the importance of the seemingly small detail.
*   The speaker asserts that algorithms don't just bump up to old lows, it makes it seamless with bits of overlap.
*   The speaker then says that there will be books about this, but it was never mentioned before him.
*   This overlap hides the pattern, preventing easy identification and exploitation.
*   This pattern has not been widely documented.

### Adding to the Short Position and Consequent Encroachment
*   There's a volume imbalance, and the speaker would allow price to trade up into the consequent encroachment of the wick, adding more to the position.
*   At consequent encroachment, the speaker would add *even more*.
*   They justify this by stating they are already net short from the volume imbalance earlier.

### Bearish Order Block

*   Price should *not* trade to the middle of the up-close candle, as that's a bearish order block.
*   With displacement after the low is taken out, there's no need for price to return to that level if the target of 4098.50 is the objective.

### Reading the Tape and Order Flow

*   The speaker describes a process of continuously balancing and repricing.
*   If 4098.50 is to be reached, it would be permissible for it to trade up to that level.
*   If we were doing a live trade, the speaker would be saying we want to see it go lower.
*   So what's going on. It trades down, so this high to this low becomes a balanced price range.

### Balanced Price Ranges and Algorithmic Precision

*   If the market has delivered both buy side and sell side, then it should go lower.
*   There's no need to re-enter that range.
*   The speaker uses the analogy of painting a wall: you don't paint the same spot multiple times.

### Consequent Encroachment

*   Consequent encroachment of the wick becomes the area of engagement.
*   Because we do not need it to come back up here, because this candle went down to the low, and the next candle happens to open up there.
*   So it does not need to come back up into the candle.
*   There is a balance to a smaller balanced range so you wouldn't see it have to come up there.
*   What can it do? What is permissible? Halfway.

### Mean Threshold

*   Looking at it through the lens of mean threshold.
*   Using bodies and wicks as a gauge for price movement and momentum.
*   At 4097.50, that is what you could reasonably be traded to and it's permissible.
*   The market doesn't go there and trades lower than that now.

### New Balance Price Range

*   Now that the market trades lower, mean threshold to this becomes the new balance price range.
*   You want to see the market trade away from there which it does.

### Time of Day and Aggressive Liquidity Targeting

*   The speaker notes the time is 15:24, indicating it's late in the day.
*   At this time, the market will aggressively reach for liquidity and aim for its targets.
*   The market runs to 4078.25, hitting it at 15:34.
*   You want 20 minutes to four.


Okay, here is the refined and organized version of the provided text.

# Market Analysis: Liquidity Runs, Order Flow, and Fair Value Gaps

## Liquidity Runs and Time of Day

*   Waiting for a **price run on liquidity** is key, especially because after 15 minutes into a specific timeframe (unspecified but implied to be a market open), the market will aggressively target untapped liquidity.
*   An example is given:
    *   Buying "silicone" (likely a typo for "see liquidity") at a specific point.
    *   The market will trade listlessly between a high and a low.
    *   Retail traders will try to trade within that range, becoming entangled in the "mess".
*   The market is simply creating a low, moving off that low, and repeating a simple macro pattern.

## Reading Price Action and Order Flow

*   Understanding **order flow** is crucial.
*   **Overlap of price** indicates direction:
    *   If sell-side is offered, the price is going down (down candle).
    *   If bullish, a down-closed candle should be re-delivered with an up-close price movement, then back down.
    *   It doesn't need to close with an up candle if it was a recent down-closed candle.
*   An example:
    *   A down-closed candle exists.
    *   The next candle opens up, trades up, overlaps the previous candle, and then goes down, making a lower low (leaving a wick).
    *   This is the same principle of requiring both directions.
*   Efficient delivery requires both directions (up and down, or down and up) within a **price point range**.
    *   The range must be fully overlapped.

## Market Efficiency and Inefficiency

*   Efficiently delivered price occurs when the market trades back and forth between defined price points, delivering in both directions.
*   Inefficient price action occurs when this doesn't happen, creating situations like fair value gaps.

## Fair Value Gaps

*   A **fair value gap** consists of three candles.
*   The inefficiency is identified by the candle in the middle.
*   It is defined by the candle prior and the candle after.
*   The segment of price action in between those candles is the fair value gap.
*   Just because price goes up to a fair value gap does *not* automatically mean it's a shorting opportunity.

## Avoiding Afternoon Market Reversals

*   Avoid fading afternoon market reversals, especially close to 4 o'clock.
*   Fading means trading against the trend (e.g., shorting a rally).
*   The market may ramp up against you to induce **short covering**.
*   Short covering creates order flow.
*   The "composite man" (a term for the market makers) uses this order flow to balance books.
*   Commerce exists alongside speculation. There are transactions.

## Currency Market Dynamics (Forex)

*   Specific times of day are used to facilitate order flow.
    *   **London close** (10 AM to 12 PM New York local time) is one window.
    *   This time facilitates order flow for short covering or selling longs.
*   The London close condition allows new volume into the marketplace.
*   Order flow is used for the commerce aspect of Forex.
*   It's not *all* just speculation; real business needs influence currency markets.

## Live Market Example

*   Two points of reference were given:
    *   Volume imbalance here
    *   Volume imbalance there

## Feedback and Encouragement

*   Feedback is encouraged on Twitter.
*   Derogatory or disrespectful comments will result in muting (but not blocking).
*   Positive feedback is appreciated.
*   The speaker will be active on Twitter.

## Concluding Remarks

*   The speaker feels good about what was shared and delivered in terms of price action.
*   The speaker wishes everyone a pleasant evening/morning and to be safe.

*   Observation: A small fair value gap is present.
*   Key Area: Focus on the current level.

## Breaching the Propulsion Block

*   Concern about price movement: Speaker stated that price should not go through the propulsion block.
*   Consequence of breach: If the price trades through the propulsion block, it's probable cause for it to want to go down into the volume imbalance area.

*   Price Action: Trades up into it and reprices lower into the fair value gap and volume imbalance.
*   Small Area: A small area here as well, and this low is sell-side.

## Volume Imbalance Flexibility and Seamless Delivery

*   Trading within the Volume Imbalance: Trading up into the volume imbalance or below it.
*   Tolerance: The market can trade up to the high end of it and actually go through the volume of balance.
*   Seamless Delivery: The market likes to see seamless delivery.
*   Overshoot: Overshoot to this candle's low is permissible.

*   Respecting Encroachment: Bodies respecting the encroachment of that midpoint.
*   Micro Market Structure Observations: Small micro market structure observations.

## Volume Imbalance Flexibility vs. Fair Value Gap Strictness

*   Mindful Alignment: Be mindful to alignment and balance.
*   PD Array Confusion: Knowing which PD arrays to be more flexible with.
*   Volume Imbalance Flexibility: Allowing price to move through it back and forth, using it as support/resistance.
*   Fair Value Gap Strictness: Demanding specific actions. Not as loose.
*   Reclaiming Levels: If broken and price goes away, can be reclaimed.
*   Back and Forth Movement: Common with volume imbalance.

## Volume Imbalance Identification and Broker Feeds

*   Volume Imbalance Definition: Separation between two candles bodies, but wicks can touch or overlap.
*   Issue with Broker Feeds: Some brokers or micro accounts don't show volume imbalances.
*   Solution: Watch the price action of the mini and trade with that insight.

## Current Analysis

*   Consequent Encroachment: Allowing price to the mean threshold.
*   Target Areas:
    *   Right below here.
    *   Specifically, the bison efficiency the lower end of it here is sell sign.
    *   Order Block.
*   Desired Action: See if we get the price to want to dig down deeper.

## Volume Imbalance Repricing

*   Volume Imbalance Expectation: Volume imbalance so it can reprice back up into this area here.
*   Preferred Outcome: The speaker preferred it if price didn't reprice to volume imbalance.
*   If Volume Imbalance is Breached: If price breaches through it then we're going into this area here.

## Rationale for Watching Price Action

*   Purpose of Monitoring: Observing price action.
*   Market Conditions: Lethargic and choppy at times.
*   Twitter Coverage: The speaker was covering on Twitter.
*   10-Minute Filter: Gave it 10 minutes to see what it does.
*   High and Low Calls:
    *   Called the high at **4101.50**, which is still in place.
    *   Called the low early this morning before the New York session right to the tick.

## Fed Influence

*   Goober Comment: The speaker was told on Twitter on why he said that it could go [Down].
*   Fed Speaker Impact: Fed speakers can create wild price action.
*   Allowance for Inaccuracy: When the FED is involved, you have to make allowances for being inaccurate.
*   Fed Effect: When the FED gets involved, all the rules go out the window.

## Skepticism Regarding Fed Influence

*   Smoke Screen: Fed speakers' words are used as a smoke screen for price action.
*   Dissenting View: The speaker is not a subscriber to the view that the market reacts to what they are saying.

## Card Shuffling and Market Spotiness

*   Card Shuffling: Explains the card shuffling is to keep his hands busy while watching the market.
*   Volume Imbalance Observation: Speaker wanted to see if the market could stay under this volume imbalance.
*   Market Spotiness:
    *   Definition: Having volume imbalances in multiple areas.
    *   Difficulty: Makes it difficult to get a real smooth run to a price level.
*   Porous Pockets: Markets spotiness can be explained as having porous pockets in price that the market spends more time rebalancing.

## Market Consolidation Scenarios

*   Equal Highs: Equal highs are present.
*   Potential Rally: If we were to rally and come back down and find some support here then, because of time being 3 30 now, we might see a macro run us up into these highs here and take out the buy side that's resting over here.
*   One of Two Outcomes:
    *   If it goes above it finds the support here then it would look the rally otherwise.
    *   It's going to rip right on through and not even look back at it.

## Market Structure Shift and Discount

*   Gap and Swing High: The market has a gap and a swing high.
*   Market Structure Shift: Technically, a market structure shift after trading into a discount.
*   Fair Value Gap Resistance: Bumping up against this fair value gap.
*   Upside Desire: The speaker wants to see price stay wanting to go higher.

## Trade Considerations and Stop-Loss Placement

*   Caution Against Immediate Longs: Can't just take a long here and put your stop-loss there because you have this inefficiency and it can come back down into that.
*   Stop-Loss Placement: Stop would have to be down here around 89.25.

## Bearish Order Block and Mean Threshold

*   Perfect Delivery: A really perfect delivery to the low end of the Fair Value Gap.
*   Bearish Order Block: Should not act as a speed bump.
*   Ideal Scenario: It wouldn't be ideal for it to hit this and be slowed down at all.
*   Desired Action: The speaker wants to see it go through that and more specifically not just enter it but go right through the midpoint of the candle, which is mean threshold.

## Validation of Market Movement

*   Watching Order Block: When watching an area and thinking if it's going to reach for buy side or attack the daily high going into the close on a Friday.
*   Mean Threshold Requirement: If he has an order block, he's watching price and wants to see it quickly go into the candle's body and go right through the midpoint, which is mean threshold.
*   Confidence Indicator: That's the qualification that's the little nudge that he's confident that it's going to do what he's expecting it to do if it runs quickly through the midpoint of the order block.
*   Non-Ideal Scenario: If it does a run up here and just bounces away from it and just meanders around, that's not as ideal.
*   Potential Outcomes: It means that it could consolidate or it could reverse entirely and come back against the idea.
*   Mean Threshold Annotation: Will annotate the mean threshold on this candle in the event if we get a run.
*   Mean Threshold Level: 95.25.
*   Desired Action: The speaker wants to see it rip into 95.25 aggressively and run right through it if it's going to rally and go for the buy side.
*   ICT Trust: How do you know ICT to trust these moves and it's because of that it's tearing into the order block and not respecting the mean threshold, which is this little red level here.

## Market Behavior and Conclusion

*   Unfavorable Action: Doesn't want to see it go into the order block and fail to run up into mean threshold.
*   Retracement: Retracing back down into the fair value gap, which is something that you don't want to see and it takes much more for it to turn around and go higher from this point.
*   Stop Anxiety: If you're in a trade and your stops at 89 as we indicated down here because we have this sphere but you got it can be a little unnerving for you.
*   Anticipated Move: Is going to dig stuff back down into that fair value gap.
*   Candle Consideration: We want to see this candle here or the very next one because it's 52 seconds.

This structured format should be much easier to read, understand, and analyze while retaining all the original information and the speaker's tone.


# Market Analysis and Trading Commentary (Continued)

## Pre-Candle Open Expectations

*   **Desired Price Action:** Before the new candle opens, the speaker wants to see the next candle immediately run higher without hesitation.
*   **Mean Threshold**: Specifically, he wants to see it "tear through" the mean threshold, showing no respect for that level.
*   **Undesirable Scenario**: The speaker emphasizes that he *doesn't* want to see the candle "turn on" him, meaning it must stay above its low.
*   **Acceptable Dip**: A dip to "dig through" is acceptable, but it must maintain upward momentum.

## Focusing on Buy-Side Liquidity

*   **Shifting Focus:** With the initial conditions met, the speaker shifts focus to the buy-side liquidity.
*   **Order Block Comparison**: He wants to see the same event (rapid price movement) occur at the fair value gap as was previously observed at the order block.
*   **Mental Charting**: Despite not having the levels on his charts, the speaker is mentally tracking key price points.
*   **Target Price:** With price around 4097.50, he's looking for a surge through 4097, specifically targeting the midpoint or consequent encroachment of the fair value gap.

## Fair Value Gap Dynamics

*   **Definition:** The gap is defined by the space between the low of one candle and the high of another, referencing the "one little down closed candle."
*   **Trading Nuances:** The Speaker noted that he is referring to the Fair Value Gap created from the low of the bullish engulfing candle up to the high of the next.

## Speed, Distance, and Confirmation

*   **Trading Vocabulary**: When looking for bearish moves in his recorded trades, the speaker often notes he's looking for "speed and distance" or a "sharp decline."
*   **Bullish Conversely:** Conversely, for bullish moves, he looks for "large range green up close candles."
*   **Confirmation Signal:** The rapid movement to the consequent encroachment acts as a confirmation that his directional bias is correct.

## Velocity and Wishful Thinking

*   **Expansion Expectation:** If the price breaks through the fair value gap, the expectation is for it to expand upward with significant velocity and speed.
*   **Target Level:** This expansion should target the level above, aiming to take out the high.
*   **Personal Bias:** The speaker admits he *wishes* the 4101.50 high wouldn't be taken out.
*   **Reasoning**: He wants to be right with his prediction.

## Accurate Call Confirmation

*   **Fairytale Stuff**: He highlights the prediction of the day's high and low as "fairytale stuff" that others claim is impossible.

## Current Market Movement

*   **Handle Movement:** The market has already moved about five handles (points).
*   **Open/Close Mentioned**: Opened on that close rather 9250.
*   **Retest Possibility:** The speaker notes that price can come back and touch the fair value gap, which is acceptable.
*   **Consequent Encroachment Watch:** His focus shifts to the consequent encroachment of the wick.

## Three PD Arrays

*   **Support Evaluation**: The speaker watches to see if the consequent encroachment supports the price.
*   **PD Array Requirement**: He requires three PD arrays to break before considering a class A trade or taking profits.
*   **Current Assessment**: Currently, nothing is considered "problematic," and he expects an expansion to occur.

## Buy-Side Liquidity and Consistency

*   **Target**: He expects it to run through buy-side liquidity and target 4100.
*   **Pattern Recognition**: The speaker highlights how consistent this pattern is.
*   **Availability**: He emphasizes that this level of insight has always been available.
*   **Personal Journey**: The speaker notes that the viewer is just starting to use it

## The Learning Curve

*   **Uncomfortable Beginning**: New traders need to overcome the initial discomfort of not knowing what they're doing.
*   **Observation and Recording**: The key is to observe, record, and identify repeating patterns.

## Profitable Scenario

*   **Buy-Side Liquidity Purge**: Buy-side liquidity has been taken.
*   **Partial Profit**: And that would have been a partial for you.
*   **Easy Setup**: Buying the Fair Value Gap.
*   **Closing Price Consideration**: The speaker notes that the high and closing price is essentially the same.

## Bread and Butter

*   **Bread and Butter Setup**: A bread-and-butter setup that is easy to execute.
*   **Frequency**: Setups like these occur multiple times a day.
*   **Stop Management**: Traders can roll their stop to +1 (one tick in profit) and see if a run to new highs occurs.
*   **Avoiding Limitations**: Don't limit potential profits, especially near the 3:45-3:50 PM window.

## Macro Influence

# Market Analysis and Insights Before CPI Release
## Introduction
Good morning, folks! This analysis focuses on market expectations ahead of Tuesday's **CPI** release. Be very careful on Tuesday prior to CPI as it's likely going to be a mess and can wreck the market. After CPI is released, it's okay to pursue remaining liquidity or imbalances. This week's calendar and related topics will be discussed further on Twitter.
## Economic Calendar & CPI Anticipation

*   Monday is expected to be light due to anticipation of the **CPI** news driver on Tuesday.
*   **CPI** is expected to cause a significant, one-way movement in the market.
*   **Caution:** Exercise extreme caution before the **CPI** release.
*   **Do not trade before CPI.**
*   **CPI Impact:** Typically moves 50-100+ handles upon release.

## Dollar Index Analysis

### Weekly Chart Observations
*   **Dollar Index:** A work in progress.
*   A short-term low was taken out on the weekly chart.
*   The gap between candle lows and highs has been entirely overlapped.
*   A large wick is present; annotate the midpoint for consequent encroachment. Round to **104.80-104.85**.
*   Price returned inside a buy-side imbalance outside inefficiency.
*   The weekly gap has been completely overlapped.

### Premium Arrays
*   **Buy-side liquidity pool.**
*   **Old volume imbalance.**
*   **Weekly consequent encroachment level** of the weekly gap high.

### Discount Arrays
*   The consequent encroachment of the wick on the weekly chart.

### Important Note on Market Open

*   No one knows where the market will open on Sunday.
*   Analysis based on current data, before Sunday's open.
*   Observations are given for both premium and discount scenarios.

### Potential Scenarios (Pre-Sunday Open)
*   Inspiration to look at both premium and discount levels.
*   Keeping expectations low on Monday due to **CPI**.

### Trading Advice: DO NOT Trade Ahead of CPI

*   Avoid trying to forecast **CPI** beforehand.
*   The market moves rapidly upon **CPI** release.
*   It's risky to be on the wrong side of the trade.

### Discount Array Levels (Below Current Market Price)

*   Current market price (at the time): **103.578**.
*   Low for sell-side liquidity.
*   Buy-side imbalance outside and inefficiency consequent encroachment.
*   Volume imbalance.

### Post-Sunday Open Instructions

*   Measure the midpoint between Friday's closing price and Sunday's opening price.
*   This is the consequent encroachment for the new week opening gap.
*   Apply this to all markets, especially Forex pairs (Dollar Index + Forex pair) and E-mini S&P.
*   Use three specific levels within that range and monitor them until Friday's close.
*   The market will refer back to these levels.

## Euro Analysis

### Previous Commentary Recap
*   Reactions to previous analysis observed (buy-side liquidity sweep into fair value gap).
*   Refer to January's commentary for context (YouTube channel, unedited).
*   Price moved up into the stated area.
*   Small fair value gap re-priced on Friday.

### Key Levels and Considerations

*   Nice displacement lower observed.
*   Carry the range out; if price goes through it and returns, it may act as resistance.
*   **Key Level:** Low and midpoint (consequent encroachment) of the January 9, 2023, daily candle (fair value gap).
*   If price accelerates lower with a stronger dollar, sell-side is the next liquidity target.
*   Use the consequent encroachment of the wick on the lower end as a potential stopping point.
*   **Caveat:** Analysis based on the assumption that price *will* go lower (indicating expectation of higher dollar).

### Wick Analysis

*   Short, stubby wicks (relative to candle size): The low will get probed without going through it. It will stop at consequent encroachment.
*   Long wicks: If bearish, price often goes directly to consequent encroachment and stops.
*   **Indicator:** Failure to reach consequent encroachment of a long wick indicates a very bearish market.

### Wick and Candle Relationships
*   Wicks formed in areas where candles create a wick:
    *   If the body comes down to the old fair value gap high, and the next candle trades up and back down, watch for the consequent encroachment.
    *   If bearish, the consequent encroachment may not be reached.
    *   This is sometimes used for live trade executions, trusting price won't go through consequent encroachment.

### Order Block and Fair Value Gap

*   Note the order block high.
*   Note the fair value gap.
*   If price trades through the low end of the fair value gap (high of the January 6th candle), expect the low of the rectangle and consequent encroachment (midpoint between January 10th low and January 6th high).
*   **Important:** Don't want to see price trade back above that level if it goes below it.
*   Look for a run into the wick and/or consequent encroachment.

### Potential Lower Targets

*   If the low is taken out, there's no imbalance to the left.
*   Small sell-side liquidity pool exists.
*   No imbalance exists due to overlapping candles.
*   The next area of interest is further down.
*   Institutional order flow: Expect bearish order flow.
*   Up-close candles provide resistance.
*   Fair value gaps keep price at bay.
*   The low of the fair value gap or consequent encroachment is the defining boundary for retracements.
*   Watch for sharp moves away from these levels.

## Order Flow Discussion

*   **Order flow is bearish.**
*   No need for trend lines, moving averages, depth of market ladders, or volume profile.
*   Focus on high, low, and close prices in real-time.

## Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Considerations

*   Expect a surge in the dollar and a decline in foreign currencies and equities.
*   **Risk-Off Scenario:** Flight to quality, typically benefiting the dollar.
*   It's hard for other markets to gain traction in conditions where the dollar is rallying.
*   Everything usually drops in relationship to a higher dollar.

## Disclaimer
Be cautious of price movements, especially in intraday price action.


# Inter-Market Relationships and Analysis

## Index Preferences: Dow, NASDAQ, and S&P 500 (SPX)

*   The speaker does not trade the **Dow** due to its "spotty" nature and tendency to overreact sporadically.
*   The **NASDAQ** is preferred as it can "overreact and over deliver."
*   The **S&P 500 (SPX)**, specifically the **SPY**, is favored for its smoother and more controlled movements, lacking the erratic exaggerations seen in the **Dow**.
*   The **Dow** can range and chop around before aligning with **NASDAQ (NQ)** and/or **S&P 500 (ES)**.
*   If you are successful trading the **Dow**, continue doing so.

## Personal Preferences and Market Scope

*   The speaker has no interest in **crypto** or **synthetic indices**.
*   Limited knowledge of the **Nifty 50** and the **Indian markets** prevents commentary on them.
*   Opinions are shared on markets the speaker has experience with.

## Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Awareness

*   Global events impact all markets.
*   **War:** Pay attention to global conflict, as it affects every market.
*   **GDP:** The speaker will briefly cover GDP before discussing the E-mini S&P 500 (ES).

## Pound Dollar (GBP/USD) Analysis

### Hypothetical Scenario (Pre-CPI Release)

*   Assumption: The dollar strengthens due to a **CPI**-driven surge, causing index futures and Forex pairs to decline.
*   This scenario could lead to a run on **GBP/USD (cable)** below current lows and sell-side liquidity.

### Sell-Side Imbalance, Buy-Side Inefficiency (SIBI) Analysis

*   Identifies a fair value gap (sell-side imbalance, buy-side inefficiency).
*   **SIBI Definition:** One-sided downward candle lacking buy-side efficiency. It requires re-pricing with upward movement later.
*   The difference between the candle's low and the previous candle's high defines the SIBI.
*   The market tends to re-price back into the range of the SIBI.
*   This pattern is favored in intraday charts for intraday trades.

### Key Observations and Cautions

*   Price moved slightly below Thursday's low, closing near it.
*   The low is 1.20572, with the close slightly above it.
*   Caution is advised due to this analysis being pre-Sunday open.
*   The market may open relatively unchanged due to **CPI** anticipation.

### CPI Impact and Market Expectations

*   **CPI** is the main event, described as a "tornado," "tsunami," or "weapon of mass destruction" that can disrupt the market.
*   Expect carnage on Tuesday due to **CPI**.
*   Monday's trading is expected to be quiet ahead of **CPI**.
*   Trading on Monday is possible, but massive range movements are unlikely, barring unexpected events.

### Bullish vs. Bearish Scenarios and Signals (Pre-CPI)

*   **Bearish Scenario:** Best signal would be a gap lower on Sunday, followed by a rally back up into it overnight or on Monday morning. Look for a willingness to go lower.
*   If intraday lows on Monday are relatively equal, and those lows remain ahead of Tuesday’s CPI release, that reinforces a bearish perspective. CPI could rush through those lows, weakening the pound vs the dollar.

### Analysis Timing

*   Analysis typically done late Friday or early Saturday morning.
*   Articulating analysis takes time, justifying the speaker's detailed explanations.

## Question Handling and Patience

*   Detailed explanations aim to address potential questions preemptively.
*   Patience is emphasized, as immediate answers may not always be available.
*   Immediate feedback is not crucial, as the market requires patience and discipline.
*   The market will provide more frustration than the current learning process.
*   Learning in a demo account is encouraged to avoid financial risk during volatile periods.

## Sunday Opening Scenarios

*   **Relatively Close Opening:** If Sunday's opening is relatively close to Friday's close, Monday is likely to be quiet as the market awaits **CPI**.
*   **Large Gap Lower:** A significant gap lower on Sunday creates a trading opportunity for Monday.

### Understanding Gaps and Liquidity Voids

*   Large gap on Monday morning will have a tendency for the market to rally up into the range that’s created by the gap, the difference of Friday’s closing price and where we open on Sunday.
*   The speaker discusses S&P (SPX) gaps but correlates to GBP/USD due to risk-on/risk-off factors.
*   Forex gaps are viewed differently due to continuous delivery (trading from Sunday to Friday). Gaps are separations between trading sessions.
*   Gaps between Friday close and Sunday open is a new week opening gap, which is a liquidity void.

## New Week Opening Gap

*   New Week Opening Gap: Difference between Friday's closing price and Sunday's opening price (higher or lower).
*   **New Week Opening Gap** is a specific element of price delivery.
*   New Week Opening Gap: A liquidity void because there's no trading that took place at all.
*   **Do NOT confuse gaps with sell side imbalances (sibi)**
*   "Liquidity void" is often used inappropriately to describe SIBI.
*   SIBI: A sell-side imbalance, meaning one-sidedness going lower.

### Wicks and Market Weakness

*   Failure to reach the midpoint of a wick above a candle in a bearish scenario indicates extreme weakness.

## Live Stream Commentary

*   During live streams, the speaker highlights interesting observations and desired market movements.
*   Unexpected market behavior is possible but should not be shocking if you are reading price.
*   Black Swan events (unexpected events, CPI run out of nowhere) are rare and virtually untradable.
*   Learning in a demo account is crucial due to market volatility.

## Current Market Conditions

*   Current market conditions are difficult.
*   New traders may not appreciate the challenges faced by experienced traders.
*   Conviction in market predictions requires diligent analysis.
*   Trading has been scaled back significantly to maintain focus and effectiveness.
*   Engaging with the community, providing analysis, executing trades, and live streaming helps maintain focus during difficult market conditions.


Here's a restructured and detailed version of the provided text, maintaining all original information and nuances:

# Market Analysis and Trading Strategies: A Deep Dive

## Introduction: Understanding Market Dynamics

*   The speaker emphasizes that traders who have been out of the ring (market) for months or a year may experience **"ring rust."** This rust will impact their reactions and their ability to analyze market movement effectively.
*   Active traders will be more reactive to punching (price action) and better able to slip their punches (avoid losses).
*   The speaker doesn't want to have that kind of **"ring rust,"** especially while trying to do this on a live stream.

## CPI Prediction and Market Impact

*   The speaker believes **CPI** (Consumer Price Index) will likely instigate a stronger dollar and lower index futures, stocks, and Forex values.
*   This is just an opinion, subject to change based on Sunday's opening.
*   Geopolitical or wartime events between the present and Sunday's opening could undermine everything said.

## Sunday Market Opening and Predictability

*   The speaker stresses that accurately predicting Sunday's opening price is impossible, and it's unreasonable for learners to focus on this.
*   Markets are inherently inconsistent in this regard.
*   The same unpredictability applies to the 6:00 PM EST weekday reopening after the one-hour close.
*   While the speaker can teach how to anticipate whether markets will gap higher or lower, pinpointing the exact opening price or immediate reaction is impossible.
*   A gap lower doesn't guarantee an immediate repricing back to fill it; several factors must be weighed.

## Educational Approach and Considerations

*   The speaker is aware of the questions that arise when they teach and takes time to reflect before speaking.
*   The speaker strives to be thorough, respects the audience's time, and provides all relevant facets of experience within context.
*   The intention is to offer detailed explanations, including subtle nuances.
*   The speaker anticipates reasonable questions and addresses them preemptively.

## Chart Analysis: E-mini S&P 500 (ES)

*   The speaker transitions the analysis to the **E-mini S&P 500 (ES)**.
*   The speaker explains the reason for not going into lower time frames is time as he does not have 4 hours today.
*   The speaker knows some of the viewers are potato chips and drink their beer and yell at the screen about guys throwing around a piece of Rawhide.

### Weekly Chart Observations

*   A swing high has formed after surpassing previous highs.
*   Prior draw on liquidity was taken out on Thursday.
*   A challenge occurred on Friday, leading to a softer close.
*   The market could not get down to encroachment of this daily candle's Wick.
*   The speaker suggests carrying these levels from the daily chart down to lower time frame charts.

### Personalization of Charts

*   Learners should use their preferred colors and annotations on their charts.
*   The goal is originality and personal expression, not mimicry.
*   The speaker wants to see how learners apply the information and develop their own trading styles.
*   Independent thought is valued and traders are encouraged to explore Pat Whelan, trades by Matt, and Tom Hugard.
*   Annotations should reflect personal approaches, color schemes, and notes.

### Integrating Speaker's Levels with Personal Observations

*   Include the speaker's levels in addition to one's own observations.
*   These observations may subconsciously affect price action.
*   The "epiphany" moment may stem from these observations.

### Avoiding Derailment of Creative Development

*   The speaker is careful not to undermine the normal creative development of a trader.
*   Influence from the speaker's opinions can affect trading decisions, even if the speaker is unaware of the learner's trade.
*   If a trade would have been successful if one had ignored the speaker's input, one should do so.
*   The speaker reminds students and viewers that they can use the same concepts but trade in opposite directions and both be profitable.
*   If affected by the speaker's analysis or key levels, one should keep their trusted charts, but don't negate the speaker's information.

### Clarification on Sharing and Seeking Approval

*   Learners don't need to share their additional observations with the speaker.
*   The speaker discourages reliance on others to "co-sign" one's observations.
*   Confidence in one's analysis is essential.
*   The speaker emphasizes that if he doesn't mention something in one's chart, it doesn't mean it isn't valid. He might be looking for something else.

### Weekly Chart: Key Levels and Considerations

*   The speaker stresses the importance of the information being shared.
*   The speaker highlights struggling points that real students with real money experience, impacted by something the speaker said, or a level he pulled up, second-guessing themselves.
*   On the weekly chart of the ES, note the consequent encroachment of the current week.

### Chart Annotations and Color Coding

*   Extend the opening and high of the down-closed candle on your charts.
*   Use the boldest line thickness (e.g., number 4 on TradingView) for monthly or weekly levels.
*   This helps distinguish them and emphasizes their importance.

### Note-Taking and Organization

*   The speaker uses a pad to record key levels numerically in a PD array matrix.
*   Opening prices are written down, with weekly highs or lows above them.
*   This facilitates constant reference to where the market opened relative to these levels.

### Benefits of Numerical Notes

*   Helps with visual learning and level identification.
*   Keeps charts clean.
*   Prevents disorientation from toggling through time frames.

### Intraday Price Action

*   The speaker refers to the levels and relationships while analyzing intraday price action.
*   Once a level is traded to and touched, it's "booked," and circled on the notepad.
*   The speaker then focuses on the next level of interest above that hasn't been printed yet.
*   Learners can visually see that the price has ran by side.

### Emphasis on Practical Application

*   The intention is to communicate information clearly without causing offense.
*   The goal is to bring calmness to those who have experienced disruption in their learning due to the speaker's influence.


# Advanced Market Analysis and Trading Strategies

## Exploring Market Dynamics and Trader Evolution

### Moving to the Next Level: Floor Trader Techniques

*   The speaker aims to convey their methodology for identifying subsequent levels of interest in a bullish scenario.
*   The speaker mentions self-teaching derived from observing **Floor Traders**.

### Pivot Points and Their Application

*   **Floor Traders** calculate **pivot numbers** based on the previous day's **Open, High, Low, and Close (OHLC)**.
    *   Formula: (High + Low + Close) / 3
*   The speaker used to further divide these pivots in half to create "mid pivots" between **R1, R2, and the central pivot**.
*   However, pivot points are not emphasized in the speaker's current strategy. The speaker is merely providing context on their evolution as a trader.

### Trading Without Charts: The Tape Reading Approach

*   The speaker asserts that they can trade effectively by observing the **CNBC ticker tape** without relying on charts.
*   This approach was used when trading bonds, with key levels noted on paper.
*   The trader watches for levels to be touched, anticipating the next level based on price updates (upticks or downticks).
    *   Buying on downticks is favored.

### Floor Trader Mentality: Levels Over Visuals

*   The speaker likens this to how **Floor Traders** operate, as they don't rely on complex charts.
*   Analysis is performed beforehand, and levels are noted on notepads (e.g., spiral Mead notepads or even matchbook covers).
*   They hold tickets, buy/sell, and engage in active trading based on solid line levels, NOT Fair Value Gaps.

### Emphasis on Clean Charts and Real Numbers

*   The speaker advises against over-reliance on drawing excessive lines on charts.
*   The goal is to maintain a clean chart and work with real numbers.
*   The speaker cautions that having too many levels on the chart can subconsciously influence analysis, causing fear or bias based on past price action.
*   Focus on real-time price action on smaller time frames (1- and 5-minute charts).
*   The main priorities are identifying areas of **liquidity** and **inefficiencies**, using higher timeframe levels as guides.
*   The speaker clarifies that a monthly chart is not necessary. Weekly key levels are sufficient for current analysis.

### Note-Taking vs. Chart Reliance

*   The speaker primarily uses a notepad to record numbers rather than relying heavily on lines on the chart.
*   Lines on the chart serve as "training wheels" to learn how to read price action.
*   The ultimate goal is to be able to analyze and execute trades "naked" – without charts or external commentary, indicating independent trading ability.

## Detailed Chart Analysis: Daily and Hourly Perspectives

### Daily Chart: Volume Imbalances and Order Blocks

*   On the daily chart, the speaker identifies two **volume imbalances**, noting the importance of annotating all four levels (closing and opening prices) of each.
*   Use the same color scheme for the closing and opening prices of each volume imbalance.
*   Employ distinct color schemes to differentiate between the imbalances (e.g., green for up-delivery, heavy black for down-close).
*   Use a large line thickness (e.g., number 4) for annotations.
*   The speaker notes two specific scenarios:
    *   **Up-delivery:** Candles are up.
    *   **Down-close:** Candles are down.
*   Pay attention to how price reacts upon returning to these levels.
*   Even seemingly small differences in level can lead to significant respect from price.
*   The speaker plans to revisit and highlight key takeaways once the price interacts with these levels during the week (if it does).
*   Also, the speaker includes in their notes **Consequent Encroachment** of a particular wick.

### Key Levels and Thresholds: Order Blocks and Mean Thresholds

*   Note the **mean threshold** (midpoint) of the down-closed candle by using Fibonacci from low to high.
*   Also, note the opening price (4077.00) of a particular candle, identifying it as an **order block**.
*   If bullish, price should not fall below the mean threshold.
*   If price opens higher but fails to go lower than the consequent encroachment, anticipate a move back up into the gap.

### Chart Annotations: Best Practices

*   Annotate levels with descriptive text, such as "Opening price on January 30th daily candle" or "January 30th mean threshold daily order block."
*   Use abbreviations to your taste.
*   The speaker intentionally avoids annotating the chart to prevent viewers from simply mimicking their style.
*   The intent is to encourage individual flair and understanding.

### Hourly Chart Analysis: Range, Equilibrium, and Expectations

*   On the hourly chart, the speaker analyzes the range from a specific low to a specific high, looking for the midpoint without using Fibonacci.
*   The current market is trading near equilibrium.
*   Determine how much time the market has spent in premium versus discount.

### Premium vs. Discount and Potential Scenarios

*   The speaker notes that more time has been spent in premium within the range.
*   The market briefly explored discount but quickly returned to equilibrium.
*   Considering it's Friday, caution is advised when interpreting this action.
*   Scenario 1: Gap Lower
    *   If the market gaps lower and trades higher, it may not need to fully return to Friday's closing price. This indicates potential weakness.
*   Scenario 2: Extended Move on Friday
    *   If the market had ended Friday with an extended move, a gap lower on Sunday would likely result in a full return to Friday's close.
*   The speaker is essentially providing real-time insights into their thought process while analyzing the charts, allowing viewers to learn their method.
*   Since closing at equilibrium, multiple back-and-forth movements have occurred, so a full return to Friday's close isn't necessary if the market gaps lower.
*   Expect price to reach into the low and attack below, targeting sell-side liquidity.

### Bullish vs. Bearish Scenarios and Breaker Identification

*   If the market gaps higher: Expect a full return back down into the closing price due to existing inefficiencies.
*   The speaker emphasizes that a gap opening below Friday's close is not equivalent to a gap higher, given the time already spent above the midpoint.
*   Assess the market in terms of overbought and oversold conditions without indicators.
*   Consider the multiple failed rally attempts, followed by Thursday's lower trading.
*   The opening on Sunday will be crucial in determining whether the market resumes higher or continues lower.
*   If the market gaps lower, expect immediate weakness targeting the lows and sell-side liquidity.
*   The speaker notes that since price came all the way back to equilibrium relative to the high on the hourly chart, they favor a down gap opening later today, with no requirement for the market to return to the Friday close.

### Alternative Bullish Scenario and Responsiveness

*   If the market gaps higher, consider it a breaker.
*   The closing price then becomes all that's necessary.
*   The market may open, trade back down into the breaker (the up-close candle), and then move higher.
*   In this scenario, if the market gaps higher and shows responsiveness at Friday's close, the speaker may be wrong, and the market could continue higher.


# Market Analysis and Forecasting for the Week Ahead

## Pre-Market Analysis and Expectations

### Disclaimer: Forecasting vs. Trading

*   The speaker emphasizes that the following analysis is **forecasting**, not a trading plan. It's an opinion shared before the week begins and not a "measuring stick" for accuracy.
*   Forecasting is not profitable in itself, and the speaker is sharing their opinions before the week begins.
*   The goal is to develop a **plan of action**, outlining potential scenarios and responses. This contrasts with retail traders who often chase market movements reactively.

### Preparing for Tuesday's CPI Data

*   The speaker is analyzing potential market reactions to the **CPI data** release on Tuesday.
*   The analysis is not a definitive plan (Plan A or Plan B). The speaker will wait for **Sunday's opening** to assess market behavior and refine their outlook.

### No Pre-Opening Bias

*   The speaker claims to never have a bias *before* Sunday's opening.
*   They may have an *inclination* or a *desired* outcome, but they cannot force the market to conform to their will.
*   The key is to align with the market's actions, weighing probabilities based on observed price behavior.

### Preferred Scenarios: Dollar Strength and Market Weakness

*   The speaker *would like* to see the **dollar strengthen** and other markets decline.
*   They are comfortable being wrong in their forecast.
*   Previous incorrect CPI forecasts did not prevent them from identifying and executing winning trades after the data release.

## Analyzing Market Structure and Liquidity

### Reflecting on the Previous Week

*   The market spent considerable time trying to move higher last week before "giving up the ghost."
*   Price moved below relative equal lows where sell stops were resting, failing to take out the ultimate low or reach the **consequent encroachment.**
*   The ensuing rally returned price to equilibrium within a specific range (high to low).

### Avoiding Formulaic Analysis

*   The speaker is not simply looking at the high and low of a range, dividing it in half to find equilibrium, and then waiting for a sell signal.
*   Instead, they anticipate that if price moves higher and then retraces, it will likely seek to move higher *again*, aiming to absorb sell-side liquidity below prior lows.

### Learning to Think Independently

*   The speaker highlights the importance of understanding the *reasoning* behind trades.
*   Following signals without explanation can lead to anxiety and dependence on the signal provider.
*   Relying on someone without knowing *why* they're trading requires more faith than doing your own analysis.

## Specific Market Expectations and Scenarios

### Preferred Scenario: Bearish Outlook

*   The speaker prefers to see a **lower gap opening** that does *not* fully retrace to Friday's closing price.
*   This would signal weakness and a "breakaway gap," indicating a departure from the retracement.
*   The retracement is viewed as merely a return to equilibrium relative to a low-to-high range, revisiting old order flow and prior lows.
*   The "sloppy" nature of the price action during the retracement suggests a final, unsuccessful attempt to gain a grip.

### Bullish Scenario and Requirements

*   If the market gaps *higher*, a full return to Friday's closing price *would* be expected.
*   The speaker wants to see a **gap higher**, come back into it and show a willingness to rally.
*   This demonstrates a potential shift in market structure after the return to Friday's close.
*   Blindly buying the retracement back to the closing price is not the approach.

### Gapping Scenarios: Lower vs. Higher

*   **Gapping Lower:** No need to trade back to Friday's close. An attempt to trade higher, leaving the gap partially or fully open, would signal weakness.
*   **Gapping Higher:** Expect a full return to the closing price.
*   The speaker wants to identify what he *reasonably expects* to see and what he *doesn't want* to see.
*   The latter are events that are *not likely* to occur.

### Case Study Approach

*   The goal is to conduct a "case study" and walk-forward test, building confidence in responding to market openings.
*   The goal isn't knowing what's going to happen but building the confidence in how you respond to what's going to happen.

### Unlikely Scenario: Lower Gap Followed by Immediate Rally

*   The speaker believes a gap lower followed by a "raging higher" move is unlikely.
*   A more probable scenario involves a gap lower, a partial or incomplete gap fill, and then a move lower to target sell-side liquidity.

## Internalizing Price Action and Liquidity

### Three Drives Pattern

*   The speaker identifies a potential "three drives" pattern, suggesting a move to liquidity resting above recent highs.
*   The constant reaching for liquidity indicates an intention to prevent anyone from profiting from a lower gap opening that never revisits those levels.

### Compressed Price Action

*   The speaker describes the price action as "too compressed," suggesting constant attempts to reach for liquidity in the form of buy stops.
*   These buy stops protect those who may consider shorting.

### Holding Hands and Waiting for More Information

*   If the price action deviates from the outlined scenarios, the speaker will remain inactive.
*   More information will be required from **Monday's 9:30 opening**, as the absence of news events before Tuesday's CPI data suggests limited market movement.
*   Most traders are expected to remain on the sidelines until the CPI release.

## Sunday Expectations and Closing Remarks

### Limited Sunday Interest

*   The speaker acknowledges that many listeners will be preoccupied with **football games** on Sunday.
*   He doesn't personally follow sports.

### Twitter Updates

*   The speaker will provide updates on Twitter regarding the timing of their live stream in the morning.
*   He encourages listeners to be safe.

## Analysis of Market Data (YouTube Video: dwJcsi3ddFg)

This analysis focuses on market observations and potential trading scenarios discussed in a YouTube video. The presenter uses a combination of technical analysis, tape reading, and understanding of market context to formulate potential expectations. Caution is advised due to upcoming CPI data.

### **I. Introduction & Chart Setup**

*   **Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwJcsi3ddFg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwJcsi3ddFg)
*   **Charts Used:**
    *   **Left:** US 500 CFD (for those unable to tape read the E-mini S&P 500)
    *   **Right:** E-mini S&P 500 Futures Contract (ES) - Primarily focused on this one.
*   **Disclaimer:** The presenter is experimenting with displaying both charts and acknowledges it may be distracting. The goal is to focus on the ES chart and minimize annotation on the US 500 chart.
*   **Timeframe:** Primarily using a 5-minute chart on the ES. Will drop to a 1-minute chart if needed.

### **II. New Week Opening Gap Analysis (ES)**

*   **Sunday Opening Price:** 4105.00
*   **Friday Closing Price:** 4099.50
*   **Gap:** Higher (New week opening gap)
*   **Midpoint:** Heavy dashed Red Line (respected level so far)
*   **Observation:** Price has shown a willingness to respect the midpoint.
*   **Volume on Balance:** Being monitored.
*   **Buy Side Liquidity:** Resting above the high on ES.

### **III. Chart Cleanliness & Premium Considerations**

*   **Chart Strategy:** Keeping the chart as clean as possible, mainly focusing on new week opening gap levels and some daily levels.
*   **Premium:** ES is trading higher than Friday's close, creating a premium relative to the opening price versus Friday's close. This gap-up suggests a potential drawdown into the price action.
*   **Drawdown Levels:**
    *   **Primary:** High of Friday's session
    *   **Secondary:** Wicks (though there isn't much efficiency on the 5-minute chart, one might find some on a 1-minute chart).
*   **US 500 (Left Chart):** Acknowledges audience interest but remains primarily focused on ES due to the early session and lack of compelling setups.

### **IV. Expectations & Cautions (CPI Tomorrow)**

*   **Near Term Expectations:** Low due to the upcoming CPI data release tomorrow.
*   **Goal:** To work out a range and potentially capture a "five handle run" near the close of the morning session.
*   **4111 Level (ES):** Consequent encroachment of the daily candle from February 7th, 2023 (lower wick). This level is expected to be "mean reverted."
*   **Liquidity:** Expects liquidity to be resting at the 4102.25 level in the form of sell-side liquidity.
*   **Relative Equal Lows:** Observed.

### **V. US 500 Analysis (1-Minute Chart & Consequent Encroachment)**

*   **High to Midpoint:** The high formed down to the midpoint of the new week opening gap is considered a consequent encroachment.
*   **Desired Price Action:** Looking for a price run higher that can be faded OR expecting a failure/sell signal.
*   **Falcon Point:** If price breaks below the consequent encroachment level of 4102.25, that becomes a "Minor Falcon Point".
*   **Downside Objective:** If price trades through Friday's closing price (low end of the new week opening gap), the first downside objective is 4098.50, followed by 4094.75.
*   **Upper Objective:** Also considers an upside run to take out 4110 as a possibility.
*   **Overall Sentiment:** Lacks strong conviction in either direction due to upcoming CPI data, emphasizing the need for caution.
*   **Strategy:** Advises against trying to capture the entire week's potential profit in a single day.

### **VI. Further Downside Expectations (US 500)**

*   **Question:** Will price aggressively drive underneath the consequent encroachment of the new week opening gap and expand down into 4099.50?
*   **Additional Downside Levels (US 500):**
    *   4087.6
    *   4083.9
*   **Trigger:** Breakdown below the low at 4091.2 on the US 500 chart.

### **VII. Market Divergence & Specialization**

*   **NASDAQ/ES Divergence:** No significant SMT (Smart Money Technique) divergence observed at the lows of the day.
*   **Specialization:** Recommends specializing in one instrument to avoid "jumping around."
*   **Price Action:** Believes all necessary price action can be found in a single instrument.

### **VIII. Opening Range & Algorithm Influence**

*   **Opening Range:** Emphasizes minimizing focus on the first 15-30 minutes of trading.
*   **Algorithm Influence:** Highlights the importance of the 10:00 AM hour, when algorithms often start running.
*   **Focus:** Will look for buy-side or sell-side liquidity and inefficiencies that reside during the 9:50 to 10:10 timeframe.
*   **Current Strategy:** Trying to "get a feel" for the market direction; acknowledges it's too early to tell with high probability.
*   **Caution:** Warns against gambling and projecting desired outcomes onto the market.

### **IX. Current Market Structure & Key Levels (ES)**

*   **Pre-Market Run:** Notes a pre-market run before 9:30 AM.
*   **Friday's Close:** An attempt was made to reach Friday's close after the 9:30 AM open.
*   **Support:** Support was found at the consequent encroachment of the new week opening gap.
*   **Buy Side in Crosshairs:** The high of the ES (4115) is now being targeted.

### **X. Potential Upside Targets & Judas Swing Scenario**

*   **Observation:** How will price deliver after taking out the high at the 7:27 candle?
*   **15-Minute Chart:** On the 15-minute chart, the February 9th, 2023, 12:30 candle has a sell-side imbalance and buy-side inefficiency.
*   **Upside Potential:** If price runs through the high (4115) with strong momentum, 4122.5 could be reached.
*   **Rejection Scenario:** If price gets above 4115, rejects it, and starts to break down, it could return to Friday's closing price (potential Judas swing).
*   **Overall Caution:** Reiterates caution due to CPI data and advises against strong convictions. Focus on "bread and butter setups."

### **XI. Bullish Breaker Scenario & US 500 Comparison**

*   **Current Market State:** "50/50" - No obvious run.
*   **Advice:** Warns against impulsive trading, especially on a day with limited expected movement.
*   **Desired Setup:** Prefers to see price "rip higher" due to the retracement into a breaker.
*   **Breaker Definition:** An up-close candle after a down move.
*   **Scenario:** Price traded inside and completely re-priced to the low of the buy-side imbalance sell-side efficiency.
*   **4118 Target:** A nice reach above for buy-side liquidity. Piercing through this level is enough.
*   **US 500 Comparison:** US 500 has already surpassed the buy-side liquidity, while ES has yet to do so.
*   **Visual Aid:** Annotates the ES chart with the bullish breaker that traded down into the buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency to make the trade more obvious to viewers.
*   **Bullish Breaker Target:** Target should be a five-handle run.

### **XII. Concluding Thoughts on Current Price Action**

*   **Key Observation:** The presenter is watching the midpoint of the candle (consequent encroachment). Price has already tapped above. Expecting the price to expand through the midpoint and reach 4118.
*   **Fibonacci Tool:** In the same manner the downside objectives are determined, Fibonacci tool can be used to determine upside objectives. The presenter is looking for price runs that have retracements and buy side liquidity above where the market is acknowledging.
*   **Long Term Objectives:** Last week the presenter was trying to teach how to find price runs higher and how far they can go.
*   **Breaker Definition** This upwards came up here we have a low the high using the candle bodies, not the candle wicks. The bodies tell the story.
*   **Conclusion:** No strong sentiment because it is expected that a lot of traders are sitting on their hands in wait for the "ripple" tomorrow. The presenter wants to trade with the displacement.
*   **Breaker Confirmation:** The breaker is confirmed once it takes out the highs and makes a significant run.
*   **Important Notes:** It traded into two PD Arrays, that were in the form of a discount. A discount because price is here it trades down into this up close candle here, which is the highest up close candle between the low here and the lower low here.


## Detailed Market Analysis & Trading Scenarios (Continued)

This document provides a detailed analysis of market conditions and potential trading setups, expanding on the concepts discussed in the previous sections. The focus remains on technical analysis, tape reading, and understanding market context.

### **XIII. Leveraging Opportunities & Managing Risk**

*   **Long Position Considerations:** If a long position was taken, the presenter suggests annotating the chart to recognize the opportunity.
*   **Targeting Levels:**
    *   A partial take profit at **4115** (where buy-side liquidity is resting) is acceptable.
    *   A full take profit at **4118** is preferred, as it's above the high and buy-side liquidity.
*   **Risk Management Ahead of CPI:** Due to upcoming CPI data, it's crucial to manage risk.
*   **Lowered Expectations:** Lower expectations due to the potential volatility from CPI.
*   **Increased Selectivity:** Be more selective in choosing trades due to the uncertainty.
*   **Anticipating Volatility:** Recognize that the market may not deliver as precisely as expected ahead of the CPI release.

### **XIV. Market Observations & Data Trustworthiness**

*   **NASDAQ/ES Correlation:** Notes that the NASDAQ supported the run-up, indicating no significant distribution.
*   **Volume on Balance (VOB):**
    *   **US 500 CFD:** VOB is not always respected precisely.
    *   **Futures Market (ES):** VOB is more trustworthy.
*   **Data Recommendation for CFD Traders:** Even if trading CFDs (US 500, US 100, US 30), it's recommended to track futures data for more reliable insights.
*   **Disclaimer:** The presenter jokingly said that watching last night's Super Bowl was the first football game he ever watched.

### **XV. Targeting 4118 & 15-Minute Inefficiencies**

*   **Target:** A move to 4118 is anticipated.
*   **Volume on Balance:** Monitoring whether price touches Volume on Balance and then moves to 4118.
*   **Ideal Scenario:** Price comes down to test the imbalance before taking out the high and moving towards 4118 and 4121.
*   **Current Price Action:** The market has already started to run, going above the bodies of recent candles.
*   **Bull Shoulder Block:** The series of two down-closed candles is now considered a bull shoulder block.
*   **Desired Support:** The presenter wants to see this area support price.
*   **Targeting Specific Levels:**
    *   The opening of the bull shoulder block candle can be touched, then price should "rip" into **4118** and **4121.5**.
    *   On the ES chart, note **4133.75**, the high end of the 15-minute fair value gap.
*   **15-Minute Fair Value Gap:** The gap is located on the February 9, 2023, 12:30 candle.
*   **Importance of Zoom Level:** Too much zoom on the chart can obscure these levels, emphasizing the importance of context.
*   **Consequent Encroachment (Midpoint):** Annotate **4120** (consequent encroachment) on the chart.
*   **Gradient Levels:** Additional levels to consider include **4125.25** and **4128.25**, especially in a "blow off move" to the upside.
*   **Session High Objective:** If price reaches the high end at 4133.75, it should be considered the session high objective, and you "move the sidelines."

### **XVI. Chart Clarity & Opening Range Considerations**

*   **US 500 CFD:** The presenter apologizes for not annotating the US 500 chart due to difficulty focusing on both charts simultaneously.
*   **Focus on ES:** The focus remains on the ES futures contract, noting the difference in highs and lows compared to the US 500.
*   **Opening Range:** Emphasizes the importance of not rushing into trades based on the opening range.
*   **Patience:** The presenter emphasizes that the initial price runs are not essential to participate in, especially during uncertain conditions.
*   **Audio Feedback:** The presenter requests feedback on audio clarity via Twitter.

### **XVII. Falcon Point & Fibonacci Tool**

*   **Revisiting Falcon Point:** The discussion returns to the Falcon Point concept for identifying expansions.
*   **Current Positioning:** Price is between the low and the consequent encroachment (midpoint) of the 15-minute gap from February 9th.
*   **Fibonacci Tool Application:**
    *   Draw the Fibonacci retracement tool from the low to the high of the wick to measure range.
    *   Wicks are used for range measurement, but consequent encroachment/quarter points are used for entries.
*   **Key Levels Identified by Fibonacci:**
    *   **-2 Standard Deviation:** 4126.25
    *   **Consequent Encroachment:** 4130.50
    *   **-3 Standard Deviation:** 4134.50 (outside the February 9th fair value gap).
*   **Target for Morning Session:** Consequent encroachment is satisfactory.
*   **Run from 9:50 AM:** Focus on the market's behavior between 9:50 AM and 10:10 AM (a macro timeframe).
*   **Ideal Scenario:** Price reaches 4118/4121.5 and the 15-minute fair value gap.
*   **Action:** Screenshot your chart as soon as the price hits this level, and annotate your observations.
*   **Developing Patience:** Managing emotions and developing patience are crucial for tape reading.
*   **Objective Analysis:** The presenter emphasizes pointing out likely market movements without being attached to being right or wrong.
*   **Ugly Price Action:** Acknowledges that current price action is "ugly" but still tradable.

### **XVIII. Chart Cleanliness & Low Resistance Liquidity Runs**

*   **Chart Clarity:** Emphasizes that as the charts clean up, setups become more precise and easier to identify.
*   **Low Risk, High Probability Setups:** Difficult to identify in current market conditions due to chop and retracements.
*   **Desirable Market Signature:** Sharp runs with immediate profitability and minimal retracements, signifying "low resistance liquidity runs".
*   **Teaching Objective:** Focus on teaching how to identify these "low resistance liquidity runs."
*   **Student Frustrations:** New students often struggle with understanding market signatures and seek spoon-fed signals, which is not the teaching approach.
*   **Teaching Focus:** Helping viewers learn to read the tape and understand price action to identify their favorite setups.

### **XIX. Fair Value Gaps & Institutional Order Flow**

*   **Retracement into Fair Value Gap:** A retracement down into a fair value gap occurred.
*   **Fair Value Gap Definition:** Buy-Side Imbalance Sell-Side Inefficiency (BISI).
*   **Key Levels:**
    *   **High of the Candle:** 4120.50
    *   **Low of the Candle:** 4120.25 (one tick outside the fair value gap)
*   **Acceptable Deviation:** The slight deviation (one tick) is permissible, especially given the context of the upcoming CPI data.
*   **Market Context:** Tomorrow's CPI release is the "real event" causing reduced precision.
*   **Avoiding Thursday/Friday Trades:** This imperfect precision is similar to why the presenter avoids trading on Thursdays and Fridays before payroll.
*   **Leaving Relative Equal Highs:** Market could run higher and take out the high, "leaving what they left", specifically, the relative equal highs that offer liquidity.
*   **Potential Downside Scenario:** Don't be surprised if the market dips below the recent low, creating the illusion of a top.
*   **Balanced Price Range:** The presenter identifies the back-and-forth price action as a "balanced price range."
*   **Breakaway Gap Consideration:** If bullish, it would be ideal for the gap to remain open as a breakaway gap, allowing for reaccumulation of long positions.
*   **Stop Loss Management:** Emphasizes not trailing stop losses too tightly due to potential fair value gap formations.
*   **PD Array Matrix:** Relates the current concepts to the PD Array Matrix taught in previous weeks, highlighting the importance of premium and discount zones.

### **XX. Target Measurement & Fibonacci Retracement Tool(Cont.)**

*   **Objective:** The current teaching is about repricing, emphasizing that knowing the potential direction is more important than the entry strategy.
*   **Potential Upside Targets:**
    *   Standard deviation of -0.5: 4127.50
    *   4129.75: "This level here!"
*   **Consequent Encroachment as Primary Objective:** If the market reaches the midpoint of the 15-minute gap, this would be the objective for the morning session. Expansion to the high-end would be less likely.
*   **Fibonacci Retracement Tool (Usage):** Using Fibonacci for measurements, not classical ratios.
*   **Standard Deviations over Classical Ratios:** Standard deviations are preferred when understanding market narratives, liquidity, and inefficiencies.
*   **Retail Fibonacci Usage:** Dissociation from retail Fibonacci usage.
*   **Relative Equal Highs (Buy-Side Liquidity Pool):** These highs are identified as a buy-side liquidity pool.
*   **Short-Term Low (Stop Losses):** Breaking the short-term low would trigger stop losses above the highs, creating buy-side liquidity.
*   **Extended Fair Value Gap Annotation:** Extending fair value gap annotations for clarity.
*   **Clear Chart Annotation:** Emphasizes maintaining clear annotations to avoid confusion while teaching.
*   **Potential Dip into Fair Value Gap:** After taking out the short-term low, price could dip into the BISI fair value gap.
*   **Institutional Order Flow (Entry Drill):** The move represents institutional order flow, a partial entry into the gap.
*   **Potential Shorting Opportunity:** The price action could lure retail traders into shorting, perceiving a double top and market structure shift.


## Continued Market Analysis & Trading Scenarios

This section details further market analysis and trading scenarios, building upon previous discussions. The focus remains on technical analysis, tape reading, and understanding market context.

### XXI. Institutional Order Flow & Fair Value Gaps

*   **Market Structure:** While a break in market structure might occur, the presenter wants to identify periods of "arm wrestling" between trader categories.
*   **Trading Back Down:** Trading back down into certain levels is reasonable.
*   **Fair Value Gap Midpoint (Consequent Encroachment):** The price didn't even reach the midpoint of the fair value gap, also known as the consequent encroachment (since it's a gap, not a candle or order block).
*   **Order Block Midpoint (Mean Threshold):** If it were an order block, the midpoint would be called the mean threshold.
*   **Price Point Level:** The price point between the high and low of a specific candle is **4118.75**.
*   **Candle's Low:** A particular candle's low was **4119**, a quarter of a point higher than the gap's midpoint of **4118.75**.
*   **Institutional Order Flow Entry Drill:** Because the price didn't reach the midpoint, this is considered an institutional order flow entry drill. This means that if you are bullish, you want to see this level of imbalance stay open.
*   **Bullish Scenario:** If bullish, ideally, the price reaches up into the consequent encroachment.

### XXII. Time Considerations & Session Expectations

*   **Time Check:** At **10:16 AM** New York time, there's still time for the market to expand, take out buy-side liquidity, and potentially reach consequent encroachment, concluding the morning session with a profit.
*   **Leaving the Gap Open:** The presenter believes they mentioned wanting to see the fair value gap left open before being traded through, potentially reaching the consequent encroachment.
*   **Breakaway Gap:** A breakaway gap is a signature where price snaps higher with no immediate interest in repricing, indicative of higher prices.

### XXIII. Cautions & Resistance in the Market

*   **15-Minute Premium Array:** The market met a 15-minute premium array in the form of the fair value gap and dipped into the lower quarter.
*   **Repeated Visits to Fair Value Gap:** The fact that the price keeps returning to this fair value gap is a reason to be cautious, especially before news events like CPI.
*   **Classic Price Delivery Before News:** This type of price action, a hurried move followed by chopping around, is typical before high-impact news like CPI.
*   **High Resistance:** Such conditions create "high resistance" in the market. This doesn't refer to support and resistance levels, but rather resistance to clean price runs.

### XXIV. Objectives & Market Dynamics

*   **Target Objective for Tomorrow:** The presenter's objective for tomorrow is a run into the imbalance midpoint at **41.28** even.
*   **High Resistance Liquidity Runs:** The presenter demonstrates what it's like to deliver in high resistance liquidity runs, which can be frustrating.
*   **One-Tick Failure:** The market failed by only one quarter of a point (one tick) to reach the quarter level of the 15-minute fair value gap.
*   **Trading in High Resistance Conditions:** Trading in these conditions requires enduring stagnant periods.
*   **Neophyte's Perspective:** For new traders, it's crucial to understand and contrast high resistance liquidity run conditions.

### XXV. Immediate Gratification & Market Conditions

*   **Ideal Scenario:** Ideally, the price trades down to the blue rectangle and then rallies higher, breaking through the buy-side and hitting **4128**.
*   **Immediate Gratification:** High resistance conditions lack immediate gratification, unlike low resistance liquidity runs, which provide immediate feedback and satisfaction.
*   **Journaling:** Record the length of time and potential failures in a trading journal.
*   **Buy-Side Liquidity:** The market could retrace without cleaning the buy-side liquidity at **41.25** and then wipe through it later.
*   **One-Sided Markets:** The presenter teaches that one-sided markets (where a trade can be justified in only one direction) represent high probability conditions.

### XXVI. Emotional Toll & Market as a Mirror

*   **Working for Profit:** In challenging environments, profitability requires significant effort, leading to exhaustion.
*   **Anxiety & Scenarios:** Traders experience anxiety, running through numerous scenarios and "what if" situations.
*   **The Market as a Mirror:** The charts serve as a mirror, revealing imperfections and requiring traders to refine their character flaws.
*   **Weaknesses:** A weakness isn't a bad thing, but rather an area for improvement that needs to be addressed or requires coping skills.

### XXVII. Chart Oversight and Performance

*   **Chart Focus:** Apologies for only following the US Futures Market (ES) closely but mentions that as long as it's comparatively analyzed with the US 500, the view should be fine.
*   **Current Chart Situation:** The presenter notes how ES is sitting, crouching below, which is frustrating in these environments.
*   **Sweet Release:** It feels like a sweet release when a trade finally goes in your direction.
*   **Screenshot for Annotation:** A screenshot should be taken to annotate the chart, recording the time endured watching the market retrace into outlined levels.
*   **Precision in High Resistance:** High resistance liquidity runs still possess precision elements, just with more choppiness and occasional deviations.
*   **Overlapping (Grass Cutting Analogy):** The presenter uses the analogy of cutting grass to describe how the market overlaps and overshoots to ensure no seams or gaps are left, resembling institutional order flow.
*   **Down-Close Candle Proximity:** This came right down to the low end of the candle, a precise reaction.

### XXVIII. Trusting the Process and Disciplined Trading

*   **Institutional Overflow** The intention for price to stay open before heading towards the consequent encroachment.
*   **Dip Down Analysis:** Any dip down here shouldn't be viewed with alarm; it is important to have a feel for a stop out.
*   **Walking Through Examples:** Live examples answer questions that will become clear by the end of the year and are necessary due to failure.
*   **Annotations are Key:** Make sure to annotate.
*   **Elements Aren't Frustrating** When we are in a One-Sided market, these elements become more simplified.
*   **Stop the Charts:** If the presenter indicates for charts to be stopped and for everyone to walk away, then discipline must be developed.
*   **Closing Remarks** The objective of the trading model is going to repeat every single day. There will be times when the markets will not favor participation. What the presentation is offering through pre-market analysis is how one can like to see price action develop.


## Detailed Market Analysis and Trading Strategies

This section provides a detailed breakdown of market analysis and trading strategies, focusing on pre-market analysis, live trading observations, and psychological considerations.

### XXIX. Pre-Market Analysis and Trading Plans

*   **Reviewing Pre-Market Analysis:** Traders are encouraged to revisit pre-market analyses to understand the context of current market movements.
*   **Plan A vs. Plan B:** The presenter emphasizes that pre-market analysis isn't about having a rigid "Plan A" or "Plan B," but rather understanding potential scenarios. This is because market conditions can change overnight (during the London session).
*   **Sunday/Monday Considerations:** The presenter acknowledges the uncertainty of market behavior between the Sunday open and Monday morning, making adaptability essential.
*   **Early Morning Analysis:** Upon waking up early, the presenter analyzed the market and shared observations on Twitter.
*   **9:30 AM Opening Requirement:** The presenter highlights a requirement for the 9:30 AM opening.
*   **Gap Higher Opening Filter:** If the market opened with a gap higher, the desired scenario was a pullback towards Friday's closing price.
*   **Observed Low:** The market's low reached 4101.50, falling short of the desired 4099.50 level.
*   **Live Commentary:** The presenter communicated live observations about the market's inability to reach the lower level.
*   **Market's Actual Behavior:** Instead of retracing to the desired level, the market rallied above a short-term high and into an imbalance (outlined on the chart).
*   **Breaker and 4118 Level:** The presenter mentioned the breaker and the likelihood of the market reaching the 4118 level, which it subsequently did.
*   **4121.50 and 15-Minute Fair Value Gap:** The market then reached 4121.50 and traded into the 15-minute fair value gap.
*   **Quarter Point Failure:** The market initially failed to reach the quarter point within the fair value gap until a specific candle appeared.
*   **Consequent Encroachment Objective:** The primary objective was to reach the consequent encroachment of the fair value gap.
*   **Partial Profit Taking:** Traders holding positions were advised to take partial profits at this point.
*   **Avoiding Trading "Over Top" of ICT:** The presenter strongly advises against trading counter to his analysis, warning of potential losses.
*   **Laboratory Experiment:** Each trading scenario is presented as a "laboratory experiment" to educate and expose traders to market dynamics without personal risk.
*   **Risk-Free Learning:** The presenter aims to create a risk-free learning environment, allowing traders to observe and learn without emotional attachments to the outcome.
*   **Efficacy of Concepts:** The presenter emphasizes the proven effectiveness of the concepts taught on his YouTube channel.
*   **Acceptance of Uncertainty:** The presenter acknowledges that there are periods when the market's direction is uncertain, and that's acceptable.
*   **Market's Communication:** Waiting for the market to "tell you what it wants to do" is a valid approach, even in high resistance conditions.
*   **High Resistance Liquidity Runs:** Even in high resistance conditions, the market is likely to deliver to anticipated levels, but it requires patience and enduring retracements and stagnation.

### XXX. Importance of Annotation and Journaling

*   **Focus on Annotating Charts:** The presenter urges traders to annotate their charts in their trading journals.
*   **Avoiding Negative Terminology:** Negative language ("this was hard," "this was stressful") should be avoided.
*   **Constructive Language:** Instead, traders should use constructive language, such as "It was surprising how much time it required for the market to trade to our levels."
*   **"Our Levels" Mentality:** Traders should be encouraged to think the levels are theirs, as they saw it coming, rather than the presenter's.
*   **Avoiding False Anticipation:** Traders should be cautious about falsely claiming to have anticipated everything the presenter outlined, as this borrows from his experience.
*   **Example of Positive Annotation:** "I'm pleased that I saw this fair value gap support price and it only went down into it partially like I was expecting and it remained open. I'm satisfied that PDA rate performed as I expected it to."
*   **Difference in Journaling Approaches:** Focus on personal observation and understanding rather than blindly copying the presenter's analysis.

### XXXI. Treating Trading as a Business

*   **Business Mindset:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of treating trading as a business.
*   **Domino's Pizza Analogy:** The presenter shares his experience managing a Domino's Pizza branch to illustrate the application of business principles to trading.
*   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Businesses operate with KPIs to manage costs and efficiency.
*   **Cost Management:** Understanding when business is slowing and overhead should be trimmed, just like in pizza business when peak hours are over, overheads (sending drivers home, not preparing too many pizzas) needs to be adjusted.
*   **Personal KPIs:** Traders need to identify their personal KPIs to establish a baseline for their performance.
*   **Individual Incorporation:** Each trader is viewed as an independent "corporation" striving for success.
*   **Avoiding Laziness:** Success requires diligence, self-management, and effective thinking.
*   **Evaluating Growth:** Traders must evaluate their baseline growth, productivity, efficiency, and mental capital expenditure.
*   **Reducing Mental Capital:** Over time, having someone with experience to follow reduces mental capital expenditure.
*   **Confidence Through Guidance:** Traders likely felt confident because the presenter provided guidance and analysis.
*   **Limited Risk:** Traders felt subconsciously that if the presenter was wrong, it didn't hurt them since it was not their opinion on the line.
*   **No Chat Window:** There is no chat window because the presenter doesn't care what peoples opinions are.
*   **Filtering Negativity:** Journals should filter out negativity and criticism.
*   **Succinct Annotations:** Record succinct and specific annotations related to expectations in tape reading or live/demo trading.
*   **Things Heard, Not Listened to:** Traders often miss things due to concerns about trades or seeking flaws in the analysis.
*   **Perspective Recording:** Record annotations from a perspective as though you have already seen it coming.

### XXXII. The Power of Positive Self-Talk

*   **Benefits of Journaling:** The journal is not for sharing, but for positive self-talk.
*   **Visual Representation:** Activate your particular activating system by having a visual representation of price action.
*   **Subconscious Retention:** The subconscious retains information better when paired with positive self-talk.
*   **Reviewing Journal Entries:** Review journal entries at the end of the week, reading them aloud to reinforce the concepts.
*   **Replacing Presenter's Voice:** Over time, traders should replace the presenter's voice with their own understanding and analysis.
*   **Independent Thinking:** The goal is to foster independent thinking, not robotic adherence to the presenter's views.
*   **Avoiding Negativity:** Never criticize oneself audibly when trading.
*   **Subconscious Damage:** Negative self-talk damages the subconscious and creates lasting issues.
*   **Recurring Issues:** Past trading failures can resurface, requiring conscious effort to overcome.
*   **Positive Replacement:** Replace negative thoughts with positive affirmations and focus on current progress.
*   **Social Media Validation:** Avoid seeking validation from social media metrics (likes, hearts).
*   **Focus on Personal Growth:** Focus on personal growth and avoid external criticism.
*   **Rejecting Trading Partners:** Collaboration is discouraged due to conflicting mindsets compounding difficulty.
*   **Manifesting Arguments:** Traders often project personal issues (arguments, job stress, family concerns) onto the market.
*   **Real-Life Distractions:** Personal obligations and concerns (anniversaries, birthdays) can impact focus and trading decisions.
*   **Acknowledging Limitations:** Traders should be comfortable acknowledging their limitations and choosing not to trade when necessary.
*   **Presenter's Example:** The presenter uses his own example of his anniversary coming up on February 14th and Valentine's Day being both his anniversary and son's birthday, making him unable to focus on trading, which is why he won't be in the live session after CPI.


## Managing Personal Life and Trading: A Balanced Approach

*   The presenter emphasizes the importance of managing personal life effectively to avoid distractions and guilt while trading.
*   Unresolved personal issues can act as a "festering wound," diverting attention from trading activities.

## Real-Time Analyst Training and Market Validation

*   The presenter is teaching viewers to become better analysts in real-time, guiding them through the thought process.
*   He invites viewers to judge the effectiveness and repeatability of the concepts being taught.
*   The consistency between his teachings and his tweets is highlighted, with the presenter noting that he only tweets the wins and has never deleted anything.
*   He asserts that his transparency is not bragging because there is substance and verifiable results.

## Example Trade and Commentary

*   He refers to reaching a target: "**Future quarter third quarter uh notice that's been reached now so it really should expand up and touch the top of that I think that would be favorable like to see it happen**"
*   He mentions an "inside jig boom hello" moment.
*   He suggests viewers screenshot the trade because it demonstrates what it feels like when you understand price action and its predictability.

## The Satisfaction of Independent Analysis

*   He expresses the feeling of satisfaction when price moves as anticipated and mentions not caring if it continues beyond the target once his objectives are met.
*   The presenter encourages traders to close positions, annotate charts, and step away for an hour to enjoy the moment.
*   He stresses the difference between watching a video, reading a book, or copying someone else's trade signals versus personally executing a successful trade based on independent analysis. The latter provides a unique and rewarding experience.
*   He acknowledges that while copying trades might be profitable, it lacks the fulfillment of earning the results through one's own understanding and effort.
*   There is no shame in it if you need to do that as an alternative.

## Limitations and the Reality of Trading

*   He recognizes that some individuals may not be equipped to trade successfully due to inherent limitations.
*   Not everyone is going to be able to trade.
*   He acknowledges that some personalities are not simply equipped to do this.
*   The presenter anticipates that some viewers may struggle when he stops doing live sessions, feeling like they've lost a "crutch" or "training wheel."
*   This could feel like doomsday.

## Alternative Learning Resources and Signal Services

*   He mentions that many people have learned because of the mentorship, and more will learn how to trade exceedingly well.
*   He anticipates more individuals will become proficient and offer their own signal services.
*   The presenter clarifies that he is not affiliated with these future signal services and receives no kickbacks.
*   He has given students the okay to create signal services, noting that if they offer a 30-day trial demonstrating their ability to predict price action, they are likely legitimate students of his.
*   If they do not, they are not his students and they do not know how to do this [ __ ].
*   Those offering services claiming his mentorship should "walk it Forward" and demonstrate their skills for a full month.
*   He says that is a reasonable assessment for someone that's going to offer signals.
*   He will not co-sign or verify anyone's services; individuals must prove their abilities independently.
*   He encourages viewers to tweet "#1" if they agree with this assessment.
*   He contrasts this approach with industry standards where accounts are often blown in 90 days.

## Addressing Doubts and Criticisms

*   He cautions against spending time with "jokers" claiming to be trained by him or to know "Enigma" when their live stream results demonstrate otherwise.
*   He confirms there are levels of difficulty and reward in trading, and the path taken is up to each individual.
*   He is trying to remove the doubts.
*   The presenter aims to be helpful in guiding viewers through the process and dispelling negative perceptions about him.

## Personal Discomfort and Commitment to Mentorship

*   He expresses personal discomfort with public mentoring, as it goes against his guarded nature and promise to remain private.
*   This is something he never really wanted to do because it's personal.
*   He is doing this because he understands that many viewers need it, especially in his last year of public mentoring.
*   He wants to return to being "private Michael" and is uncomfortable with his current level of public recognition.

## Utilizing the Opportunity and Achieving Results

*   The presenter urges viewers to take advantage of the opportunity by following his instructions and avoiding actions he advises against.
*   He promises that those who do so will either achieve the desired results by November or be very close to it.
*   He expresses confidence in his ability to demonstrate what seems impossible to others.
*   He intends to sit with the viewers every single day to show them.

## Live Stream Format and Transparency

*   He will be doing the livestream each day that he doesn't have to edit anything.
*   He states that he is doing more than the intended two live sessions a week, because daily sessions are more beneficial for viewers.
*   He commits to transparency, acknowledging errors and providing corrections when necessary.
*   Once live-streamed, content cannot be altered and remains on his YouTube channel "as is."
*   He encourages viewers to take what they find useful and to revisit challenging concepts later in their training.

## Market Analysis and Trading Plan for the Afternoon

*   The presenter notes "a nice runoff here".
*   He will be closing down the S&P 500 data.
*   He identifies a premium area between 4143 and 4144.5 as a potential target.
*   He considers everything beyond that point to be balanced and of little interest until reaching "buy something here."
*   He suggests focusing on that level for the rest of the day.
*   If the market hasn't reached that level by the afternoon session, it will be his last-hour trading objective.
*   He emphasizes that this is his personal approach and not necessarily what others should trade.
*   He advises viewers to annotate their charts with this information to observe if there is a reason for the market to drop there.
*   Beyond that point, there is nothing else that needs to be viewed as inefficient because it's been back and forth.

## Session Wrap-up and Schedule Adjustments

*   He hopes the session has been useful.
*   He plans to touch base the next morning.
*   He apologizes for not being punctual and intends to start earlier the next day.
*   He plans to start at 8:00 AM New York local time to get other tasks done.
*   He explains that Tuesday's live session must end by 9:45 or 10:00 AM due to family obligations.
*   He acknowledges that his wife is his boss.
*   He ends with a reminder to be safe.

# **CPI Commentary and Market Analysis**

## **Disclaimer:**

**Important:** Before diving in, please note that the following commentary is for educational purposes ONLY. The speaker explicitly states that it should **NOT** be used as a basis for live trading, especially on the day of CPI releases. The speaker admits to historical inaccuracies and advises against following their analysis as a trading signal.

## **Sound Check and Introduction**
*   The video begins with a sound check, with the speaker requesting viewers to confirm audio quality on Twitter.
*   **Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdnGlropfmU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdnGlropfmU)
*   Good morning message and transitioning to the main topic: the CPI numbers.
*   **Emphasis on Caution:** The speaker strongly advises against using any commentary as a basis for live trades, particularly on CPI release days.

## **CPI and E-Mini S&P Chart Analysis**

*   **CPI Impact:** Discusses the volatility associated with CPI releases. Historically, the E-mini S&P (**ES**) can move between 50 to 100 handles.
*   **Chart Reference:** The speaker refers to an hourly chart of the E-mini S&P.
*   **Liquidity Levels:** Mentions potential buy-side liquidity at **4208.50** and sell-side liquidity at **4060.75**.
*   **Current Observation:** The speaker is watching to see if the market hits the buy-side liquidity level before the CPI number release.
*   **Risk Assessment:** Trading before the CPI release is described as a gamble with high risk and potential regret. Success in such trades is attributed to luck rather than skill.

## **Brief Review of Previous Day's Market Action**

*   **15-Minute Time Frame:** Analysis focuses on the previous day's market activity using a 15-minute chart.
*   **Morning Session Strategy:** Speaker looked for a clear run on either a premium or discount array at the beginning of the morning session.
*   **Weekend Prediction:** Over the weekend, the speaker anticipated a gap higher followed by a retracement to Friday's close, with a subsequent move higher into imbalances.
*   **Monday's Outlook:** Speaker liked the New Week Opening Gap (NWOG) and mentioned it on Monday, prior to the trade.

## **Understanding New Week Opening Gap (NWOG)**

*   **Definition:** NWOG is the Sunday opening price (the very first tick) that prints on Sunday.
*   **Application:** Draw a horizontal line across the entire week of trading at the NWOG price. Also note the previous week's Friday closing price.
*   **Consequent Encouragement:** Splitting the range between NWOG and previous Friday's close in half gives the consequent encouragement level. This acts as support and resistance throughout the week.
*   **Consolidation Phase:** If price keeps gravitating back to the consequent encouragement level, it indicates a consolidation phase. Adjust trading to allow for short-term surgical strikes (scalps).
*   **Trending Markets:** Trending markets move away from this level aggressively and tend not to return to it.
*   **Today's Example:** Notes how price went above the NWOG, came back down to consequent encouragement.

## **Fair Value Gap Analysis**

*   **15-Minute Fair Value Gap:** Refers to a 15-minute fair value gap from February 9th, 2023, at 12:30 (a bearish candle).
*   **Framing:** The fair value gap is framed by the high and low of that candle.
*   **Liquidity Assessment:** Notes buy-side liquidity above.
*   **Potential Target:** If the market runs the smaller liquidity pool, the speaker expects it to run the larger one as well.

## **5-Minute Chart Review**

*   **Consequent Encouragement Test:** Notes how price came back down to consequent encouragement at 9:35 AM and then moved back up into the 15-minute fair value gap.
*   **Fair Value Gap Gradient:** Speaker used a gradient of the 15-minute fair value gap, with the first 25% equaling equilibrium (consequent encouragement). Then, 75% and finally, the high.
*   **Responses:** Describes how there were responses off those levels.
*   **Retail Support and Resistance:** Compares to retail support and resistance, noting that retail methods are too subjective.

## **1-Minute Chart and Audio Issues**

*   **Entering 1-Minute Chart:** Speaker transitions to a 1-minute chart to watch the CPI release unfold.
*   **Audio Problems:** Announces that the audio quality will change due to a headset malfunction. Apologizes in advance for any issues and states they are unable to fix it during the live stream.

## **Detailed 1-Minute Chart Analysis**

*   **Buy-Side Imbalance:** Notes a buy-side imbalance before inefficiency.
*   **Upper Quarter Retest:** Price shaded back down into the upper quarter of the 15-minute fair value gap.
*   **Gap Identification:** Points out a small gap on the chart.
*   **Live Observation:** Speaker and viewers watched as price reached into the gap, then retraced to the upper quadrant of the 15-minute fair value gap.
*   **Range Measurement:** Speaker measured the range from the high to the low of the 15-minute fair value gap, with the midpoint being consequent encouragement.

## **Bullish Scenario Explained**

*   **Consequent Encouragement Sensitivity:** If bullish, you don't want to see price return back to consequent encouragement.
*   **Fair Value Gap Preference:** Ideally, a fair value gap should remain open. If the market trades back down, it should only touch the upper portion of the fair value gap.
*   **Upper Quadrant as Support:** If price touches the upper quadrant, it should then support price and rally away.
*   **Last Hour Trading:** The upper quadrant was possibly a draw on liquidity for the PM session. More detail on using this will be provided.

## **Limited Chart Review and TradingView**

*   Speaker states he's not a trading view All-Star and there's more efficient ways to do this.
*   **Market Structure Shift:** There was a shift in market structure of the fair value gap.
*   **Targeted Buy Side Liquidity:** The speaker wanted to see it respect that rally through and take out the buy side: **4118** was the target, then 4121.5, and the **15-minute fair value gap** was the goal.
*   **Screenshot Recommendation:** Advised viewers to screenshot their charts and annotate what they saw.
*   **Breakaway Gap:** Speaker wanted the fair value gap to remain open as a breakaway gap.

## **Last Hour of Trading (Final Hour Macro)**

*   **Revisiting Final Hour Macro:** Focus shifts to the final hour of trading and revisiting the "final hour macro."
*   **Macro Definition:** A macro is a short list of instructions or directives for an algorithm to run, which tends to repeat.
*   **Exception:** Macros may not work if the algorithm has already moved allotment earlier in the day. In this case, the last hour may be listless and choppy.
*   **Algorithm Behavior:** The speaker shows how the algorithm uses price action elements and trigger points to determine standard deviations within a small micro-market structure.

## **Detailed Analysis of Upper Quadrant and Market Structure**

*   **15-Minute Fair Value Gap Revisited:** Reminds viewers of the 15-minute fair value gap from February 9th.
*   **Quadrant Levels:** Identifies the midpoint, lower quarter, low, high, and upper 25% of the fair value gap.
*   **Bullish Scenario:** If bullish, you don't want to see price trade down to consequent encroachment but it is allowed. If price comes down and touches the upper quadrant, it should act as support.
*   **Short-Term High:** The short-term high at 4137.5.
*   **Bullish Market Structure Shift:** A bullish market structure shift occurs when price trades one tick above that price.
*   **Bullish Order Block:** Looking back from the candle's high, there is a bullish order block.
*   **Volume Imbalance:** The volume imbalance serves as the macro.
*   **Final Hour Timing:** This occurs between 3:15 and 3:45, with price expected to run to buy-side liquidity.

## **Standard Deviation and Liquidity**

*   **Anchoring Deviation:** Use the low up to this short term high to determine your standard deviations.
*   **Buy Side Target:** Which has to go above, and we're looking for **4150.00**
*   **Position Square Time:** Positions should be squared by 16:00 (4:00 PM). The high of the candle at 4:00 is **4150.25**
*   **Seamless Delivery:** The market wants a seamless delivery; it will not always stop right at the tick.
*   **Narrative and Liquidity:** The run from low to high is coupled with narrative and liquidity. For example, there is an old low.
*   **15-Minute Fair Value Gap:** If it is going up and dropping down, remember that 15-minute fair value gap.
*   **Buy-side Takeout:** What was taken out here?


Okay, I will organize the text into a well-structured, readable format while retaining every detail, context, and nuance of the original content. Here's the response:

# **Further CPI Commentary and Market Analysis**

## **Disclaimer:**

**Important:** Remember that the following commentary is for educational purposes ONLY. It should **NOT** be used as a basis for live trading, especially on the day of CPI releases. The speaker admits to historical inaccuracies and advises against following their analysis as a trading signal.

## **Recap of Market Structure and Liquidity**

*   **Short-Term Low Significance:** A short-term low indicates a shift in market structure that is bearish counter-trend.
*   **Trading Without Bias:** The speaker notes how, using this information, traders can buy and sell on the same day. While some traders may operate primarily in one direction with a daily bias, it is possible to trade without a bias. This is achievable when you understand what liquidity is likely to provide in terms of the next draw.
*   **Fair Value Gap Interaction:** A small fair value gap leads to a trade up into it, which then delivers below that short-term low.
*   **Market Structure Shift Considerations:** This may be a shift in market structure for some traders. However, others may be trading intraday volatility, which means that this may not be significant for them.
*   **Consequent Encroachment Revisit:** The market returns back up into the consequent encroachment of that 15-minute fair value gap (the shaded area). Remember to change the color to see this clearly.
*   **Sell-Side Attack:** It then rolls down and attacks the sell-side liquidity.

## **Standard Deviation and Liquidity Targeting**

*   **Trigger Identification:** Using the same premise, this is a trigger to start running standard deviations from the high to that low.
*   **Sell-Side Liquidity Focus:** Here's the liquidity, or sell-side liquidity, if you want to aim for something below that.
*   **Fair Value Gap Targeting:** Below that low, we have the old fair value gap.
*   **Successful Target Hit:** The standard deviation from high to low below that low hits the target wonderfully.
*   **Fair Value Gap Proximity:** This one here is inside of the high end of the fair value gap that's shaded as a 15-minute time frame.
*   **Complexity Acknowledgment:** The speaker acknowledges that this may seem complicated but emphasizes that it becomes clearer with more examples.

## **Understanding Key Levels and Institutional Order Flow**

*   **Quadrant Identification:** Here is consequent encroachment (actually, the upper quarter), and this is consequent encouragement.
*   **Bullish Market Dynamics:** If you're bullish, you don't want to see the consequent encouragement level hit; you want to see it respected in the upper portion of the fair value gap.
*   **Institutional Order Flow Entry Drill:** This will act like an institutional order flow entry drill, where it just goes into an imbalance or a fair value gap and then runs higher.
*   **Short-Term Low Interaction:** You have a short-term low here. It stopped right at that quarter point, the upper quarter of the fair value gap that's shaded in grey.
*   **Quadrant Levels Reminder:** Remember there are four levels to it: the low, first quarter, midpoint/consequent encroachment, 75% of the range, and then the high.

## **Algorithm Behavior and Price Targeting**

*   **Quadrant Significance:** If it's going to go down to that quadrant here (which it does here), how far can it go using that reference point here, which is a trigger for standard deviations?
*   **Algorithm Reach:** The algorithm can reach as far as 4130.5.
*   **Target Fulfillment:** That would be allowing for this level to be hit, but also for anybody that knows the information I'm sharing with you, their orders will fill because of the difference between the bid and the ask.
*   **4130.5 Target:** 4130.5 could be a target where it reaches.
*   **Low Identification:** What's the low over here? 4130.5.

## **Afternoon Trading Objective and Precision Execution**

*   **Market Structure Shift and Volume Imbalance:** Then you get the run here, the shift in market structure on that candle. Volume imbalance to the tick runs up to the fair value.
*   **Objective Fulfillment:** The speaker mentioned that this would be the afternoon hourly, last hour trading objective.
*   **Absentee Note:** The speaker was not in front of the charts to be able to know about this high, but you know the procedure and protocol: buy-side resting above that, and then it runs right into it there.
*   **Final Hour Precision:** The last minute of the last hour of trading right there hammers it.
*   **Limit Order Execution:** 4150, 4150 and a quarter, so that allows the limit order you would potentially have there; it would allow you to book your exit there.

## **Advanced Topics and Personal Update**

*   **Advanced Topics Teaser:** Anyway, that's a little bit of uh advanced topics just to wet your appetite because I can't spend the rest of the afternoon with you on it.
*   **Limited Availability:** I'm going to be here for a short period for the CPI number and 15 minutes after the opening.
*   **Special Day:** It's my wedding anniversary today, it's Valentine's Day, and it's my 18-year-old's birthday, so it's a whole lot.
*   **Travel Challenges:** We couldn't get back home last night after his win and his soccer.

## **Son's Soccer Team and Talent Recognition**

*   **Club Team Success:** His team is a club team, and he's had several of his members on that team be scouted and recruited.
*   **Future Prospects:** Some of them are going to South America, some of them are going to England to be used in teams over there, and it's just wonderful to see some of them doing so well.
*   **Realistic Assessment:** My son isn't that great, so I don't want you thinking I'm saying my son's gonna be a pro; he's not. He's maybe in the lower quarter of the skill sets on his team, but his team members are phenomenal.

## **New Week Opening Gap Discussion**

*   **Audience Polling:** All right, so we are looking at a woman in charge; let's take it up to a five.
*   **NWOG Inclusion:** The discussion about the new week opening Gap, I'll include this here as well.
*   **Range Identification:** If you look at the range from this line here, this one here and here, this is the previous week new week opening Gap. This is the one that we're trading off of that started this week at Sunday's opening.
*   **Key Price Points:** Sunday's opening Gap is here and here. Sunday's first price print was here, Friday's close was here. Split the range in half. That's what we're seeing it trades from.

## **The Significance of New Week and New Day Opening Gaps**

*   **NWOG and NDOG Importance:** Remember what I taught you: new week opening gaps and new day opening gaps. They are real fair value, they are real points of interest for the market.
*   **Market Gravitation:** They want to gravitate back to, and the market is designed and could do this because it allows the sentiment and interest on a large fund level for them to want to bring their orders into the marketplace, which is really the primary driver for where the market drives against liquidity.
*   **Fund-Level Influence:** It's not retail Traders, but you all learn the same things that these large funds use.
*    **Other Commentary** Watch the buy side in here over here I was watching something with the German 30 relative. Another Trader I like listening to Tom Hougaard so I'll forgot what I was saying the um fair value gaps I'm not sorry not the paragraphs the new week opening gaps are real fair value and they will gravitate back to.
*   **Historical NWOGs:** The last four you want to have on your charts just for completeness' sake and neatness. I'm only using the previous week, and this is something I taught. This is before you've seen it here.
*   **Trend Observation:** Some of you already started doing the exercise and started looking at how the market gravitates back to these old areas.

## **Market Dynamics: Liquidity and Inefficiencies**

*   **Supply and Demand Critique:** So it kind of laughs in the face of supply and demand because the Market's seeking these areas to reprice and allow real fair value in the marketplace.
*   **Essential Focus:** You need to stop thinking buying and selling pressure, and you need to think about how the market runs to liquidity and inefficiencies, because that's the only two primary functions that these markets deliver on.
*   **Time Consideration:** That's it. There's nothing else to consider it relative to time, obviously.

## **Practical Example of NWOG in Action**

*   **Previous Week Analysis:** You can see how the previous week's new opening Gap, we come up into it here. We gravitate around consequent encouragement.
*   **Price Action and Levels:** We trade down to the what? The first quarter of it from the low to the high. Look at the reaction there. Trades above it, then trades all the way down, down through it into a fair value gap, which is reasonable because it acts like what? Institutional order flow entry drill.
*   **Rally and Retracement:** Then it rallies again, comes back down, and touches what? The midpoint or consequent encroachment of the previous week's new week opening Gap right here.
*   **Consolidation and Displacement:** Then come back down again, hit it, consolidate around the high end of the new week opening Gap from the previous week. Rallies, there's your displacement.
*   **Order Block and Movement:** Comes back down, fair value got order block, old high of new week opening Gap, and then we have all this movement higher.

## **Pre-CPI Observation and Warning**

*   **Awaiting the Run:** So I'm watching to see if we get that run.
*   **Time Constraint:** We only got a minute or so before the Carnage hits the marketplace.
*   **Desired Outcome:** I really wanted to see it hit that beforehand, but now because we haven't done that, you know, it's just a matter of seeing what we get.
*   **Urgent Warning:** But do not absolutely be in the market right now. If you are, you're, I mean, you're asking for it. Thank you. Pain, pain, and suffering coming.
*   **Probability of Loss:** We'll watch on the 15-minute time frame. It'll be more impactful because one minute, it'll just scroll right off my chart too fast, and it won't be the same as seeing it.

## **Audio Apology and Past Observations**

*   **Audio Issues:** And I apologize, I know somebody, you're wanting to complain to me about the audio; it's a work in progress. I promise it'll get better now.
*   **One-Sided Market Behavior:** In previous observations and my own personal study of watching it, it tends to be immediately one-sidedness. Like it's a one-way street. It just smashes one way, and you really can't participate in it one way or the other after it comes.

## **Liquidity and Trading Challenges During CPI**

*   **Liquidity Provider Dominance:** Usually liquidity providers basically pull all of the opportunity for you to really get in shortly before, like right now.
*   **Position Assumption Difficulty:** You know, it's really, really hard for anyone to, you know, in my mind, assume a position.
*   **Demo Account Limitations:** You can do it in a demo account, but the demo you want you won't get your fill like you would want if you were trying to trade it live and gamble.
*   **Impending Volatility:** In about 30 seconds, it's going to be ridiculous.
*   **Strong Caution:** Please, please, please do not be in this Marketplace. You will lose money, guaranteed.

## **Post-CPI Strategy and Long-Term Analysis**

*   **Post-CPI Approach:** Okay, so there you go. There's my opinion about no one can hear me and be enticed by taking a trade.
*   **Regret Potential:** 13 seconds, a whole lot of regret.
*   **Inefficiency Runs:** Now, after the CPI hits and that tsunami of price action comes in, as you can see right here, then we can look for price action to allow for, you know, runs to inefficiencies.
*   **15-Minute Fair Value Gap Focus:** The trade back to the fair value, 15-minute time frame. This one here is what I'm talking about.
*   **Daily Chart Gap Observation:** What I'm looking at and what I'm really actively studying is there's a small little actual Gap on the daily chart, and I don't want to toggle away from the chart now, but it's above where we are now.
*   **Potential Upside Target:** Were it's in the 4200s and such, but I'm not saying anything about it or implying that we're going to go higher, but I want to see how they use the CPI number today because if it can turn bullish today, then we could probably see it trade into that daily Gap.
*   **August 2022 Dates:** If you look at Monday, August 22 of 2022, on your daily chart, thank you. In August 19th of 2022, those two dates for ES, you should see there's an actual Gap there where there's no no printed data at all.
*   **Long-Term Macro Analysis:** That's a real liquidity void. I'm looking at that as if CPI turns, you know, to a day where it's bullish, we might be looking to go up there longer term too. I'm just using that as a means for long-term macro analysis, not so much that that's my target for today.
*   **Showing the Gap:** I'm just watching. If scroll down, I might be able to show it on here with a there it is up there, so that's the that's the range of that daily chart Gap is showing.

## **Buy-Side Liquidity and Dollar Index Analysis**

*   **Upside Potential:** That we haven't really ran by side here yet, so that's what we're expecting.
*   **4208.50 Target:** Foreign high is 4208.50. That's the next upside draw. That's this level right here.
*   **Cautionary Communication:** Awesome. I'm trying to be very careful how I talk to you today because some of you just really want to push a button.
*   **Buy-Side Liquidity Takeout:** So we've taken buy side out now after reaching down into that old 15-minute fair value Gap.
*   **Dollar Index Observation:** Foreign dollar Index, if you look at the low one dollar for February 9th, we are just now piercing that low.
*   **Potential Dollar Rejection:** So I'm watching, do we get any kind of rejection there on the dollar? Did it start to move higher?
*   **ES Raid Possibility:** Then this is suggesting that maybe that by side liquidity pool for ES was just a raid.
*   **Avoidance of Painful Situations:** And I don't want to make any kind of determination while I'm talking to you here because I don't want to put anybody in up a painful situation just it's still unfolding with the CPI number.
*   **DX Information:** Dollar Nexus coming off of its February 9th low, I'm not saying it's reversed, but I'm just watching that right now. You can pull that up on trading view with the symbol DXY. It's free to see it all.

## **Transition to Lower Time Frames and Market Conditions**

*   **One-Minute Chart:** All right, we're gonna drop down until one minute chart because we've cleared out by my side.
*   **New Trader Perspective:** Let's see what we get here for lower time frames in here. Now looking at this as a new Trader, you know, when I first started trading, this is kind of like what non-farm payroll would look like, the really big movement.
*   **Evolving News Event:** We don't see it so much anymore today. I mean, once in a while, you get a little bit of movement, but it's kind of become a very boring news event.

## **Market Analysis and Strategy**

*   **Low-High Range Analysis:** So notice we have this low in this High here, we dip down below it, so I'm watching to see, do we surge?
*   **Consequent Encouragement Run:** We would have to show a really meaningful run above the consequent encouragement of this wick for me to feel bullish for that 4208.
*   **Absence of Actionable Information:** There's nothing in here for me to to act on, and to be honest with you, on a day like this, you want to see time between the release of 8:30 CPI number all the way to the opening at 9:30 and see how they use that opening range.
*   **Breaker Consideration:** Any other day, I would use this as a bullish breaker.
*   **Market Manipulation Awareness:** But in here, I want you to study, does the broker, does that breaker rather provide a reason for price to want to go higher after being in it like it is here?
*   **Volume Imbalance:** You have a small little volume and bounce that could dig down into that again.
*   **Inefficiency Definition:** Efficiency meaning that this is as far as you would want to see it really, really deep retracement inside up [Music].

## **Final Remarks and Forex Analysis**

*   **Consequent Encouragement Clarification:** And again for the yahoos, they're here listening. Oh, he's getting it wrong. No, I said it would need to go above the consequent encouragement for me to be bullish, and we need to do so with speed and distance and time.
*   **Narrative Building:** It ain't 9:30. Building bill hasn't rang yet, so this is all pre-session building a narrative.
*   **Market Run on Liquidity:** So far, this looks like it was a run on that 41.70. I'm just watching that dollar.
*   **Forex Traders Analysis:** All right, for you Forex Traders, look at your Euro 15-minute time frame.
*   **Pound Liquidity:** Pound has liquidity at 21.30 35, so one 1.2135, there's south side below that.
*   **Dollar Movement Consideration:** Dollar looks like it could run back up into its Gap on give me a second, I'll tell you where it is. If you look at Monday 1900 and Monday 1800, that separation between that on your hourly chart for DXY, you pull that off on trading view, it'll be the TVC symbol, a dollar could gravitate back up to that, that would put a little bit of pressure on foreign currencies.
*   **Smooth Words Caution:** It's too smooth in all words doesn't mean it's going there, but that's what I'm looking at.
*   **Clear Out Levels of Short Term Lows:** Euro still in the middle of its range it's as cleared out itself side it's actually taken out like three different levels of short-term lows on the 15-minute time frame.
*   **Chart Display Limitation:** And I realize I'm not showing you a chart. I'm I'm trying not to move around too much.

## **SMT Divergence Summary:**

*   **Euro/British Pound**: SMT divergence at the lows.
*   **USDX (Dollar Index)**: SMT divergence. The Dollar Index was unable to make a higher high respectively as Euro made that lower low.
*   Potential for higher Euro/Pound and indices.

## **Fair Value Gap Procedure (Reminder):**

*   If an imbalance is **bullish**, it should stay above its **midpoint (consequent encroachment)**; sensitivity should be at the **high or first quadrant from the high**.

## **Levels To Watch:**

*   **4155.50**: Consequent encouragement (midpoint from consequent encroachment to the high of the shaded area) and the high in that little bit of a range.

## **Real-Time Commentary & Disclaimer:**

*   The speaker stresses that this is not a trade recommendation.
*   Commentary on **watching the tape for formations** to read likely price movements.
*   Emphasizes caution before the **9:30 AM** opening.

*   Discourages trying to trade with real money or a funded account without a trade, likening it to reckless behavior.

## **Gap Analysis (Revisited):**

*   **Small gap between candles** is below consequent correction of the shaded blue area.
*   Influence of this gap on price action this morning.

## **Order Flow Considerations:**

*   Orders below for buyers, sell stops below that.

*   Describes that this price action is common but small, due to waiting for the market open

Okay, I will organize the text into a well-structured, readable format while retaining every detail, context, and nuance of the original content. Here's the response:

# **Market Analysis and Trading Strategies**

## **Targeting Beginners: Key Objectives**

*   The speaker is addressing an audience with limited trading experience, focusing on fundamental concepts.
*   **Objective:** Identify opportunities for continuous delivery towards a target that is easily achievable and rewarding.
*   An example is given: observe the market reaction after reaching the **consequent encouragement** level.

## **Fair Value Gap Analysis**

*   Evaluate if the price aggressively returns to the specified area.
*   If the price quickly reaches and surpasses the area, shift focus to the upper half of the fair value gap.
*   Ideally, the speaker would have preferred the price to break through short-term lows, reject, and then rise above the high of the fair value gap. This scenario would create multiple support factors:
    *   The original Fair Value Gap.
    *   Consequent encouragement level.
    *   Upper quarter of the gap.
    *   The high of the gap.
*   If price moves significantly above, consider it as a bullish breaker (though this is not currently the case).
*   Currently, price hasn't formed a lower low, instead returning into the fair value gap, leading to a South Side repricing.

## **Order Flow and Market Dynamics**

*   Instead of focusing on patterns and indicators, analyze where orders are likely positioned:
    *   Below old lows.
    *   Above old highs.
*   Identify areas of porous price action. Example: the small section within a down-closed candle where the price moved quickly upwards and then repriced lower.
*   The bodies of candles, especially in relation to the New Week Opening Gap, reveal the story, despite the whipsaws that may cause damage.

## **Potential Downside Targets**

*   Identify sell-side liquidity targets:
    *   **4137.25:** Between the consequent encouragement level and the low of the previous New Week Opening Gap.
    *   **4135.25:** The consequent encouragement midpoint of a specific wick.
*   The algorithm may target these levels to reprice.
*   A drop to either 4137.25 or 4135.25 would clear this small area, then the market would reveal its intention to accelerate downwards or not.
*   **Bearish scenario:** This move could represent the true reaction to CPI data, trapping net long traders who are cleared out. Smart money would have accumulated short positions above.
*   The speaker is observing whether the price moves above a certain level and rejects it.

## **Dollar and Forex Considerations**

*   The speaker is monitoring the dollar's movement.
*   The dollar is showing some strength after reaching the February 9th low.
*   **Forex traders:** Be mindful of the **1.2135** level in pound/dollar, representing South Side liquidity.
*   A move back to that level would negate all bullish Smart Money Technique (SMT) signals.

## **Reward of Technical Analysis**

*   When the speaker first started, seeing moves that targeted specific fair value gaps and levels felt extremely rewarding.
*   This approach was based on measurable, scientific levels derived from previous experiences, not ambiguous indicators or theories.
*   The levels are very specific and finite. For example, being below a fair value gap suggests a likely move towards a specific level below.

## **Bearish Confirmation**

*   Breaking through the low within the previous New Week Opening Gap would be a bearish signal.
*   Remaining below the consequent encouragement level maintains a bearish outlook for the day.
*   To consider long positions, the price would need to move back above the high of the previous New York opening gap at **4146**.

## **Framing a Narrative and Bias**

*   The speaker frames a narrative that leads to a bias for the trading session.
*   Every element has a purpose and logic, based on weighing the most favorable and least likely scenarios.
*   New traders may find this overwhelming, highlighting the need for experienced mentorship.

## **Audio Check and Confirmation**

*   An audio check is performed to ensure the audience can hear clearly.
*   Audio quality may not be optimal.

## **Key Levels and Expectations**

*   The speaker highlights the low of the previous New Week Opening Gap.
*   Reference to the 15-minute fair value gap from the previous day.
*   Key concern: whether the price trades through the early session low and rejects or starts to climb.
*   To move to a bullish bias, the price needs to be above the previous New Week Opening Gap's high (**4146**). The fair value gap will be used to assess whether the price action will break through and use as support.

## **Objective vs. Subjective Analysis**

*   Contrast between objective imbalances and subjective support/resistance lines or trendlines.
*   Imbalances are finite and objective.
*   Diagonal trendlines are subjective, varying greatly between traders and dependent on selected highs/lows.
*   The speaker argues that using trendlines aligns with herd mentality. Algorithmic markets reprice and deliver based on finite levels derived from data that is freely available.

## **Intermarket Analysis and Forex**

*   Dollar is looking strong.
*   Monitoring cable (pound/dollar) at **1.2130-1.2135**.
*   If cable accelerates downwards, consider the fair value gap.
*   **ICT Forex:** February 13th, 2023, the 9:45 AM candle on the 15-minute timeframe for pound/dollar is important.
    *   Extend this line on the chart. It puts you in the vicinity of **1.2110**.
    *   It's a reference point for drawing liquidity.
*   Crushing the **1.2130** sell-side could lead to the **1.2110-1.2108.5** level.

## **ES (E-mini S&P 500) Analysis**

*   Currently, working with the lower quarter level, which is **4137.25**.
*   This was a target to reach sell-side liquidity pools.
*   The consequent encroachment was **4135.25.**
*   After trading down into the old New Week Opening Gap low, the retracement is observed.
*   There was no imbalance in this area.
*   Focus is on the area between the midpoint and the low, or that old New Week Opening Gap. This area will be divided by partials during trading.
*   Focus is now on whether the price rejects at **4137.25**. A rejection would push prices lower.
*   Everything is bearish until the price goes above **4146**.
*   The strongest technical analysis incorporates inter-market relationships.
*   Relying solely on a single chart is limiting.

## **Importance of Intermarket Relationships**

*   All markets are interconnected.
*   Bond market analysis is important due to the fundamental influence of interest rates.
*   Interest rates drive commerce and impact all measures of commerce.
*   Knowledge of this can be found in the core content.

## **Pre-Market Prep: Identifying Key Levels**

*   Eight minutes until the opening bell.
*   Toggling the TradingView chart to Regular Trading Hours (RTH) to identify yesterday's closing price (**41.50 and a quarter**).
*   Switching back to Electronic Trading Hours (ETH).

## **Analyzing the Gap and Opening Range**

*   The market is trading at a discount relative to yesterday's close.
*   The likelihood is that the market will pull up and try to gravitate towards that price.
*   **Opening Range**: A 30-minute window from 9:30 AM to 10:00 AM to gauge the willingness for the price to return to the previous session close.
*   If there's no willingness to reprice back to that level, it's an extremely bearish sign. Focus then shifts to deeper discount objectives on 15-minute or daily timeframes.
*   The ability of the market to reprice to yesterday's levels should always be a factor considered during the opening range.

## **Fair Value and Support/Resistance**

*   The tendency to reprice to yesterday's closing price is a form of fair value. It acts as support broken turning to resistance.
*   If it fails to make a meaningful attempt to get back up there, it suggests underlying weakness and spells further decay in price.
*   In that case, the trader should look for the price to trade through the midpoint of the fair value Gap.

The process of analyzing the markets before the opening bell will continue.


Okay, I will organize the text into a well-structured, readable format while retaining every detail, context, and nuance of the original content. Here's the response:

# **Market Analysis and Trading Strategies: Live Trading Session**

## **Initial Observations and Key Levels**

*   At 9:30 AM, the speaker observes a small imbalance just above the **consequent encouragement** of the previous week's **New Week Opening Gap**.
*   Importance of maintaining a chart annotated with the **New Week Opening Gaps** for the past four weeks to gain an "x-ray view" of where the algorithm might refer back to.
*   The speaker hints at the potential for building models and algorithms based on these relationships, emphasizing that this perspective is unique and not found in conventional trading education.
*   The dollar's strength is noted, having moved through its opening gap.

## **Dollar Index (DXY) Analysis**

*   Before the opening bell, the speaker highlights key levels on the **DXY** hourly chart:
    *   **103.218**
    *   **103.284**
*   These levels represent a gap. The speaker wants to see the price stay above this gap to support lower prices on ES.
*   The **British Pound** is approaching the previously mentioned **South Side** liquidity target.
*   The **Euro Dollar** is losing ground.

## **Euro Dollar Forex Analysis**

*   **Euro Dollar Traders:** Annotate the **fair value gap** on the 15-minute timeframe on **February 13th** at the **9:45 AM candle.**
*   This fair value gap is identified as a discount opportunity.

## **Market Open and Initial Reactions**

*   Speaker notes that breaching the CostCo encroachment level on ES, specifically the low end of that shaded area at **4122.25** is what should be watched. The Opening Bell rings.
*   Screenshot the market action at the Open.
*   Reference to the old Fair Value Gap from yesterday, which is being observed to see if it stays open. A close of the fair value gap could become a factor today.

## **Intermarket Analysis and Dollar Strength**

*   The dollar index is moving higher, confirming the speaker's earlier prediction.
*   Yesterday's gap closure in the dollar index is acknowledged.
*   Emphasizing the importance of using inter-market relationships in market analysis, including the dollar index and Forex, to gauge risk sentiment.
*   The dollar index is the catalyst, with attention focused on the **February 9th low** and its rejection, leading to acceleration.
*   **Hourly chart rejection block:** **103.78** on the dollar index. This is the likely pull up target for the dollar.
*   A continued push higher in the dollar would pressure the Euro Dollar and Cable to the speaker's previously mentioned levels.
*   Cable has already hit the sell-side target.

## **ES Analysis and Key Levels**

*   Cable has smashed sell-side targets given earlier. The speaker wants to see if it reprices back into the fair value gap.
*   **Bearish Scenario:** As long as the price remains below **4128**, the speaker anticipates lower prices.
*   **Sell-side Targets:**
    *   Below the **February 12th low**.
    *   Below the near-term low.
*   Reference to retracing back into the Fair Value Gap, **4128 is the line in the sand.** If the price trades back above 4128, it may run above and then return to it.
*   If **4128** or **4131** acts as support and the price rallies back to **4140**, expect a move back to yesterday's closing price at **4150.25**.
*   The market is currently in a "deep discount," which may entice buyers.

## **Learning Objectives and Trading Psychology**

*   Stresses the importance of understanding key levels and anticipating price action around them.
*   The necessity of seeing these principles applied daily to truly learn them, not just through books or videos.
*   Acknowledges that mistakes are inevitable in trading and encourages traders not to fear them.

## **Dollar Index Update and ES Reaction**

*   Dollar Index is facing a "speed bump" trading at the **fair value gap** on the 15-minute timeframe from 9:45 AM yesterday.
*   Key dollar index levels:
    *   **103.470** (annotate on the 15-minute chart).
    *   **103.530** (low of the fair value gap).
*   The dollar index has traded into the fair value gap and above its consequent encroachment midpoint.
*   The speaker notes the reaction at **4128** on ES, describing it as a "five handle" move and highlighting the activity of high-frequency traders.

## **High-Frequency Trading vs. Algorithmic Price Delivery**

*   High-frequency traders exploit small fluctuations around key levels using algorithms, constantly buying and selling.
*   This is distinguished from the broader algorithm that "prints and books price" and gravitates towards specific levels.
*   The speaker compares the main algorithm to a highway, with high-frequency traders using individual algorithms to navigate it like exit ramps.
*   Traders can choose different entry and exit points (ramps) on the "highway" of price delivery, depending on their risk tolerance and perspective.
*   The speaker welcomes different beliefs about the existence of an algorithm as long as the provided tools and logic are applied effectively.

## **Closing Remarks and Final Analysis**

*   Reference to the evil eye from the spouse, indicating the session is ending soon.
*    Underlines the importance of having charts annotated with key levels for backtesting and observation across different timeframes.
*   Traders can't rely on a single time frame.
*   Currently above 41.28, watch the top of the fair value gap.
*   Reference to yesterday's closing price, anticipating price gravitation towards that level.
*   Sell-side liquidity building below the old high.
*   A scenario to consider: if the price reprices up to **4150.25** and then breaks down, a shift in market structure could lead to an attack on the low later in the day.
*   **4137.25** (the midpoint between consequent encroachment and the old New Week Opening Gap high). The price action did not respect the consequent encouragement.
*   The market was allowing smart money to accumulate short positions, indicating control rather than a lack of buyers or sellers.
*   "Time Distortion" and control in the market.
*   The **4137.25** level acted as a reference point for the move lower.
*   Price moved through all levels, including the fair value gap, the old imbalance from yesterday, and the old high.
*   Imbalance between the high and low candles was filled with the low going three-quarters of a point deeper into the cell.
*   High of the candle is **4114.75.**
*   A key level to watch going forward: **4150.00.**
*   It's 9:45 AM and the session is ending.

*   **Measuring Willingness to Move.**

## Potential Sell-Side Scenario and Afternoon Setup
*   Looking for a more meaningful run below for the sell side.
*   Dollar Index is holding firm, currently back below the fair value gap.
*   Looking for a break below, a rally back up and a consequent encroachment of an old fair value gap.
*   **Reasoning:** Already went through this candle's close to low, that's what consequent encroachment means here.
*   **Potential Afternoon Setup (if no breakdown on the Dollar Index):**
    *   Looking for a potential afternoon setup.
*   **Relative Equal Highs:**
    *   If they bump the highs, they'll run through and tag them.
*   **Fair Value Gap Observation:** Watch and see if it wants to come back down, touch it, and then springboard from that into the buy side resting above.
*   If it can run to **41.37** that would be a five handle run.
*   Consequent encroachment has now been reached in this way back up.

## Importance of Tape Reading and Market Awareness
*   Identifying times when the market is most likely to be choppy.
    *   Based on the daily chart where we are in that range between February 2nd's candle and today we're just marking time going sideways.
*   **Key Skill:** Being specific and nimble on lower timeframe charts.
    *   Avoid getting burned by quick reversals.
    *   Runs can be short-lived, returning quickly to the middle of the range.

## Range Analysis
*   **Midpoint Reference:** Bottom of the old five-minute fair value gap (teal rectangle).
    *   Use this as a baseline midpoint.
    *   The market keeps gyrating around that.
*   **Observation:** Consolidated here, moves away, comes back to it, and moved above it.
*   **Key Question:** Does it stay above the bottom of that five-minute fair value gap?
    *   **If Yes:** Looking for the market to expand up and attack the buy side or buy stops resting above.
    *   **Important Disclaimer:** This is not a signal or a trade, it's reading price action, which can lead to setup identification over time.

## Emphasis on Observation and Learning
*   "No setups here, I've not said here's a setup, this...you're just measuring. I'll tell you if I see something, it'll be very plainly explained to you. This is I want to see it run from here to here. Right now this is what it should do, it shouldn't do that."
*   Expectations: "Yes, it would feel a little disjointed if you just started watching these and you're expecting to hear this is a buy, this is a sell, you're rushing and you're..."
*   Realistic Expectation: "Why would you expect that you just started sitting down with me? I mean, I just began last week, it's only been one week on the realistic expectations."

## Market Update and Continued Analysis
*   **Time Elapsed:** 15-16 minutes into the opening range.
*   **Current Market State:** "Nothing really excites me in here, like it doesn't really get me interested in anything."
*   **Key Level: 4128 or Below:** Keeps us in contention for the South Side liquidity pool at 4116.
*   **Target: 4136.50:** Expected run.
*   **High Left Unreached:** Falls short of relative equal highs.
*   **Chart Annotation:** Note the mentioned high on your chart.
*   **Purpose of Watching Price Action:**
    *   Watching the candles and getting used to reading them.
    *   Understanding their relationship with previous candles.
    *   Observing reactions off imbalances and order blocks.
    *   Assessing the speed and urgency to get into the buy side.
*   **Current Market Assessment:** "In my opinion, it's spending too much time at that level here."

## Devil's Advocate Scenario and Liquidity Analysis
*   Observation: Two highs and the way we repel away from that.
*   Observation: We did not take that low out with this pass here.
*   Went through consequent encroachment of that wick.
*   Devil's Advocate Question: "What would be a reason or a catalyst for an opportunity, if there is an entity out there that's dubbed smart money, what would be the benefit of the market going up to this level here or maybe this High here?"
*   Study: "Does it go above these highs, pause or sharply reject it, and then work down towards these lows here that are now considered relatively equal?"
*   Narrative Building: "if it's going there, I want to see does it break lower and then seek the liquidity that's classified as sell side down here."
*   **Fair Value Gap Re-Test:** Came back to touch that five minute fair value gap again here.
*   **Timing and Delivery:** "At this moment is one of those signs where I'm like, okay, I got two, three minutes, it needs to deliver. If it doesn't do it, if I...I don't have a trade on, but I'm saying because it's done this, I start counting down, it has to deal with the next two to three minutes."
*   **Expectation:** Over the next two or three candles, it would have to deliver 4135.75 or higher.
*   **Condition Reminder:** We are in a choppy condition, we're not looking for trending and trending models that evolved this morning.
*   Goal: "We're studying how the Market's seeking liquidity."


# Market Analysis and Trading Strategy - Live Stream Breakdown (Continuation)

## Current Market Assessment: Aimless and Low Probability

*   "It's aimless right now. It absolutely has nothing that stands out as a high probability, low-risk trade."
*   If you are trading in these conditions, "you are gambling."
*   Market behavior: "See how it's being real fickle about getting up there? It's getting there closer and closer and closer, but it's been real lethargic in the way it wants to get there."
*   **Desired Outcome:** "Now I want to see it pop. I want to see it just reprint 4136.50, 4136.75."
*   Current Price: It's still below the **4135.75** level.

## Chart Clarification (ES vs. US500)

*   Acknowledges viewer question: "I know some of you are like, where's the US 500 chart, Michael?"
*   Reasoning: "Uh, it's a com it's confusing for me to keep looking at that chart. I tried. I'm trying to do my best to help all of you. I just I can't."
*   Alternative: "And if you're looking at US 500, you're looking at my live US I'm sorry, ES chart live."
*   Comparison: "So you can compare and contrast what you use and relate to them comparatively."
*   Price Discrepancy: "They're not going to mark to the same price identified perfectly, but the candle formations are pretty close."
*   Tracking: "So you can track everything I'm doing."
*   Apology: "Don't be upset with me because I'm trying to do more than I'm reasonably expected to."

## Five-Minute Fair Value Gap Analysis

*   **Reference:** "That blue rectangle, which is this fair bag up here."
*   Preference: "I would prefer to see it hold price."
*   Current Status: "And it's already went outside of it, we're back down in that five minutes."
*   **Journaling Prompt:** "So now think about this in your journals, in your in your notes while you're watching this because we've identified the likelihood of it being choppy and also you're learning how frustrating you can be if you're looking for an objective, which is why I told you to sit on your hands because we're in choppy conditions."
*   **Fickle Market Behavior:** "The market's going to be very fickle, fickle meaning that it's going to be a a little bit of movement that you want to see, then a lot more retracement than you want to endure, then it moves in your favor again thinking it's going to deliver what you want to do, and then it pulls back again and then it starts to run real close to it and then what does it do? It fails, it wilts."
*   **Relatable Experience:** "So this is the these are the conditions that I blew accounts with when I was trading before I knew how to trade. I would put real money into these conditions and hold on to these moves and wrestle it and say no, I put my trade on I'm I'm going to get my position filled it's going to be it's going to go here, you're not going to scare me out of it and it would just grind me up."

## Importance of Market Awareness

*   **Key Takeaway:** "So you have to know by experience sitting in these marking conditions with someone that can identify what they are beforehand and how they're going to trade, are they going to be aimless meaning they're just going to chop around and present potential opportunities to the neophyte?"
*   **Novice Trader Trap:** "They would see something in here and say, oh this is one of those things ICT talks about or this other methodology of trading."

## Dollar Index (DXY) Update

*   **Current Analysis:** "Dollar looks like it's trying to make a higher high that was that."
*   **If Dollar Presses On:** "Now if we do press on dollar, let me go over here put my charm sorry look at your 15 minute time frame dollar Index."
*   **High to Watch:** "We have a high at 104.06."
*   **Implication:** "If we clear that and show a lot of animation to the upside one dollar, that's going to push us down into that sell side."
*   **Fair Value Gap:** "We're below this the fair value Gap now this becomes a point of which I would look, please don't take this as a trade, but I would look for this now because we took a this short term low here."
*   **Bearish Shift:** "So we have the high, higher high failed to go go to a level I wanted to see it go to, we have a shift in Market structure here, it's bearish."
*   **Framing the Trade:** "How do we frame it? We have the fair value Gap low here in consequent encouragement."
*   **Potential Setup:** "If we are able and it may not do it, but if we come back up here and touch that fair value Gap or if we don't run off all the way to it getting down to a rate in one shot which it looks like it's going to do now you guys are dog piling ict's disorders cards no I'm in nothing but I would like to see it delivered that sells out now and if it was able to come back up here and touch the bottom of that fair value guide that would have been better I would have said that's a that's a short for sell side and that's where that's where we're at right now and we did so without dollar making that higher high so that is a bit concerning in my mind I gotta see how yeah we didn't we didn't get the higher high on dollar."

## NASDAQ Levels

*   **Specific Levels:** "NASDAQ you can look for 12 what is that 12 5 32. let me see I don't want to give you a wrong number here 12 5 40."
*   **Morning Low:** "And then we have the low of the morning at 12 5 34 and a quarter."

## Scenarios & Dollar Index Influence

*   **Dollar Index Key:** "Yeah dollar would have to really spread its wings here and go higher for me to feel confident."
*   **Alternative Scenario:** "Otherwise this run lower on S&P for that sell side we've identified that might be just them accumulating Longs on that cell side and then run for the buy side at 4136.50 and the reason why I'm you can consider that as a potential is because we've done no higher high on dollar Index as we ran that low out on yes so while it did go to a poll accordingly we were looking for that in itself might be a setup because it's choppy it's you know it's aimless today it would have to stay below the consequent encouragement of that teal colored fair value 4128 consequent encouragement yeah."
*   **Dollar Index Hesitation:** "Dollar's not able to sustain this run here at least for right now it hasn't."

## Market Profiles (Caution Against Simplistic Application)

*   **Importance of Identification:** "So by identifying these types of market profiles and when I say profile that's not Market profile in the sense that you use that vertical I'm sorry horizontal volume indicator and you're looking for a point of control and that's I have no faith in any of that stuff and I'm not trying to make fun of say anything disparaging about it I'm just that's my opinion and that's how I view it."
*   **Focus:** "Watch the old Fairway Gap here."

## Fair Value Gap and Dollar Index Correlation

*   **Relationship:** "This is the time when if we sell off from that fair value gap on yes then we should see lift on dollar and dollars to make a higher high foreign you want to see it roll right on through the midpoint of this Wick if it's going to go lower it's going to show you with animation just rip right through that and show no respect of the midpoint of that guy or the wick which is a gun."
*   **Dollar's Attempt:** "Dollars trying yeah here we're going to get a higher high on dollar we should see this thing."

## Higher Timeframe Dollar Index Analysis

*   **Timeframe Shift:** "Let's go to a 15 minute time frame all right so if we lose this low here and start to get animated in larger ranges and starts to speed up and we have a higher dollar ex you know advancement if we start seeing the 15 minute time frame one dollar Index really start to move to the upside and then tear through that 104.10 that would set my mind on potentially returning back to that old new week opening gap down here but we'd have to well we're in Striking Distance of the dollar making a higher high today so Let's see we get."

## Forex Market: British Pound and Euro Examples

*   **British Pound Example:** "Incidentally I told you y'all yesterday with the British pound that told you to Mark out your your fair value Gap and we traded down into it and then once we got below it traded back it as resistance and that was a nice sell-off for the London session this morning and broke lower and still ripping lower we're below 1 1992 91.90."
*   **Euro Example:** "Euro similar fashion I know you've been wanting some ICT goodness in the Forex Market but I've been away from it you need to go back so you can see how we we went down took the sale side out and we're just hanging inside that lower portion of that range."

## Reward of Understanding Market Conditions

*   **Importance:** "So when you see things like this it is very rewarding when you know what to expect and it's if it's going to be choppy it saves you all of that mental Capital about looking for big runs right away when there's nothing there yet where most retail Traders they're going to be all over this thing they're going to be trying to do something constantly and wise men tread carefully when it's like this."
*   **Patience:** "I'm willing to let go of the first move of the day when it's like this I don't care because in my back pocket I know that if I'm surprised okay say something comes out some you know some event that was unforeseen you know to me or anyone else that would be speculating and it causes the market to really move a lot that's their problem."
*   **Afternoon Session Opportunity:** "I know I have the the afternoon session that I can participate in and I'm not worrying about or fearing missing a move and I'm not forcing the understanding of what the Market's going to do right now that's what I was telling you I was concerned about because we didn't see that uh higher high one dollar yet and we went down to the South Side here all the way back up there oh five minutes I thought it was plugged in here you plug the wrong one in yeah no no my helper's not that much help this morning I apologize I buy him a car for his birthday and he's slacking already."

## Accumulation and Offset

*   "So we've taken the cell side here and as I mentioned moments ago I said if they're going to keep it in the range like this it's where it's aimless they could take it down here this outside accumulate Longs and they could be using this area up here as an offset so in other words like smart money could be buying the cell stops waiting for their price to go up to the buy side here and they would offset that and that would be the morning move for them."

## Key Levels

*   **Dollar Index:** "Still haven't had a higher high on dollar Index."
*   **ES:** "4128 if it crosses that on ES ther and then we're going to look for 4136 50 41 36 evens if it can touch that fair value Gap just below it right in here the way you test this is if it trades to the top of the fair value Gap or the middle point and rejects and goes higher then that's probably indicating that we're going to see buy side taken out and buy side is here."

## Insight

*   "Another reason why we have these conditions like this is because the morning move prior to 830 and drive in to that lower low that was the real move for the morning that was real easy that was all back here we broke through the old nearly opening Gap create a fair value Gap and Order block trades up into itself off again and down into South Side liquidity."

## Dollar Index and Fair Value Gap

*   **Observation:** "All right so we broke through our fair value Gap there and dollar looks like it may expand up into it looks like it is."
*   **Potential for Retracement:** "I doubt very seriously if it's going to retrace lower now one dollar so huh let's see if we can get a drop off this Fair bag up on yes this feels like a whole lot of uncertainty back and forth and that's exactly what you're observing do you want to trade in this environment that's that's what you take away from it and verse like looking at what we see here look at the range between 830 right here I'm gonna move my mouse around if you uh for those of you that are able to know the answer to this because I don't know I was asked by someone and this is also something I wanted to do as well I don't know how to highlight my mouse cursor while I'm using OBS and it may not offer that feature but if it does I would love for you to be able to send me a tweet let me know and I'll see it that way um don't send me emails because I have me you don't even know that's 76000 emails okay I can't keep up with it that's why I don't want to share my email address because that's not a real efficient way of communicating with me but look at the range between 830 and where we are now okay real real sloppy real choppy it's real indecisive exactly what we were calling for and we still have not had that dollar Index like a higher high so that to me takes us back to that sell side taken which we got here who's retail mindset would be they sold on the Breakout okay Trend followers okay if it goes below that old low I'll be a short seller as a retail Trader that's what their mindset usually typically is well if they're caught short right now and for them to be in the market short the counterparty to that would be someone buying their sales stop okay they're selling it to the market to get short smart money could be accumulating that as a loan where would they want to take that ride too above the morning High here and above these relative equal highs here and what's resting about that buy side."

## Market Efficiency

*   **Concept:** "So if they bought the sell stops and there's willing participants that want to buy a higher price than where we're at right now what is that that's the market efficiency paradigm where smart money accumulates sells shorts that come in the marketplace their counterparty too and when the market reprices to buy stops they will sell to those buy stops and that's offset distribution."

## Patience and Learning

*   **Action:** "So I would want to see a series of large range up close candles in here if that is in case what is unfolding here no trade and no regrets that's the benefit of having done this exercise for months you learn patience you learn to appreciate the fact that you didn't rush in when the market really isn't that clean meaning the moves are easy to see the telegraphing it's obvious what the market rarely wants to do you want to focus on trading in those environments but you can't understand what those are until you sit in environments like this where it's difficult to read and don't listen to these 20 year olds run around saying oh this is so easy this is so easy I'm doing this have them sit here and explain every individual candle if they think it's easy it's not easy I'm telling you from 30 years experience this market right now is extremely difficult and if you had an educator whether you paid for them or you're giving your time to them you would want them to be able to identify problem times in the marketplace where trading is going to be more difficult more prone for you to fail and if you can identify those times wouldn't it be beneficial to you to know not to be participating in those times and if you're too young to appreciate that you know that's that's a testimony to your infancy as a Trader because that's one of the best skill sets to have is know when not to do something that's interesting."

## Divergence and Market Relationships

*   **Dollar Index and ES:** "Dollar is not supporting that move at all in es so that means we're probably going to see a sharp move higher on dollar if we can break to lower lows on yes es might be leading it so you can look at this and say okay well you know Market keyed off of that 4134 and a quarter level which is an old new leak opening Gap low failed to go to the buy side we went to that teal colored old five minute fair value Gap here and consequent encroachment it's respected that and we're down below here we failed to touch the Fairway Gap here if it would have touched that I would have mentioned okay watch that to go down to make a lower low dollar Index is still not moving to a higher high difficult read folks nasdaq's broke its low of the day but we have not seen a lower low that's formed already from the e311 ES well I shouldn't say it like that we've had this around here but I would like to see it go through that and that would be an agreement with the es and NASDAQ making lower lows then if it just to do that but Dow has not supported that recent drop with NASDAQ so we have a bit of an smt Divergence there meaning that if you look at the Dow you can pull that up on trading view with symbol ym h2023 and that low on the Dow is higher like it is here on ES but NASDAQ it went lower and that's the S and Divergence while dollar indexes failed to make a higher high meaning we can run back for buy side at that 41.28 foreign challenging for some of you that asked the question a lot you know when I share my observations on Twitter they tend to be the right ones I'm only commenting on the times when the Market's really in my favor to do so versus if I."


# Market Analysis and Trading Strategy - Live Stream Breakdown (Continuation)

## Addressing Viewer Questions & Concerns

*   The speaker clarifies that they are providing real-time observations for viewers to study.
*   He explains his **Twitter** activity, noting that he only tweets about trades when he feels the probabilities are highly in his favor.
*   He facetiously addresses a comment about his tweets moving the market, emphasizing that the market moves independently.
*   He highlights the difference between his live commentary during choppy conditions and his selective sharing of high-probability setups on **Twitter**.

## Current Market Conditions & Strategy

*   The speaker reiterates that the current market conditions are choppy and lack clear setups.
*   He reminds viewers that these conditions are not conducive to precise trading with defined stops and profit targets.
*   **Current Status:** **ES**, **Dow**, and **NASDAQ** have all made lower lows, but the **Dollar Index** has not confirmed with a higher high.
*   **Warning:** The lack of confirmation from the **Dollar Index** raises the possibility of a false breakout.
*   **Potential Scenario:** The market could rally sharply to the **4136** level, catching short traders off guard.
*   He emphasizes that if he was making the market, he would aggressively push the price upwards to overwhelm short positions.

## Market Symmetry & Inter-market Analysis

*   **Market Symmetry:** The speaker defines market symmetry as the alignment of multiple assets. In a risk-off scenario, foreign currencies and equities move lower while the dollar moves higher, and vice versa for a risk-on scenario.
*   He explains that he uses multiple monitors to analyze inter-market relationships and gauge overall market sentiment.
*   He stresses the importance of considering multiple instruments, not just one, to validate trading ideas.
*   He refers back to this concept when answering questions he often sees, how to know, how to trust, when not to trust.
*   Even when focusing on one market (**ES**), he advises referencing others to support or negate ideas.

## Key Levels & Potential Scenarios

*   **Desired Action:** The speaker wants to see the price decisively break through the teal fair value gap with no hesitation.
*   **Consequent Encouragement Level:** **4128**.
*   If this happens, it would signal that smart money is targeting the **4136** level.
*   He plays devil's advocate, outlining a bullish scenario where a drop below sell-side liquidity would be followed by a rally to **4136**, but this would depend on the **Dollar Index** weakening.
*   He highlights the importance of observing price action incrementally.
*   **Preference:** The speaker would prefer to see the price cut through the hot butter, and go right for the area where the buy side is.
*   **Objective:** Kill the short individuals that are using a stop loss, and use the individuals stop loss as a means to offset distribute the longs that were accumulated down here with the sell side.
*   **Next Level:** 4140.25 level which is consequent encouragement of the previous new week opening Gap.

## Open Float & Key Macro Levels

*   The speaker explains the concept of "open float," identifying buy-side and sell-side areas.
*   He notes that the **10:10** macro level coincides with the sell-side of the quadruple being engaged.
*   He facetiously asks if traders with short positions would feel safe with their stops at **4136**, given the current market conditions.

## Market Breadth & the Vowel Chart

*   The speaker refers to the "vowel chart" (**VIX**) to confirm or negate key turns in the market.
*   He explains that he primarily uses it for **SMT** divergences.
*   He reiterates the importance of understanding index **SMT** divergence, where lower lows in **Dow**, **ES**, and **NASDAQ** are expected in typical Dow Theory.

## Identifying Key Candles & Bullish Breakers

*   He identifies a specific candle with the highest up-close prior to the drop below the low.
*   He's studying how the price respects or disrespects the entire range.
*   **Defining a Bullish Breaker:** Because that candle broke through that, it is now being considered a bullish breaker.
*   He refines his analysis by identifying a fair value gap within that range.
*   He would prefer to see an accumulation of long positions within this fair value gap if the market is going to target the buy side.
*   In this scenario, it would be better if the price only went to this.
*   It would be bad if the price didn't even hit the fair value Gap.
*   He says, don't let him pump you up into thinking it's a buy, he is just telling you to look at the candles.

## Potential Bullish Scenario & Market Dynamics

*   The speaker emphasizes that while the wicks can extend to the low of the bullish breaker, the bodies of the candles should ideally stay within the fair value gap range.
*   He acknowledges his own biases and the potential for him to be wrong.
*   He explains that he is looking for inefficiencies in the volume and balance, or a fair value gap.
*   **Current Observation:** Bodies staying inside the fair value gap range and starting to expand higher.
*   The speaker acknowledges the retail perspective, where the drop-off is seen as a sign of further decline.
*   The lingering presence of the high that has not been tagged.
*   His perspective is there is a lot more interest that has not been tapped into yet on the buy side.
*   Even if the market is range bound, the speaker expects it to gravitate to **4134.25** and higher (4136.50).

## Concluding Thoughts & Strategy

*   He apologizes for any background noises.
*   The speaker concludes that he still favors monitoring the buy side as a primary area of focus.
*   If the market fails to reach the buy side before lunch, he will treat it as an afternoon objective, looking for a move between **1:30** and **4:00 PM**.
*   Until then, he is not interested in trading, as the low end has already been probed multiple times.
*   He wants to see the market clean up the area around **4135.50** before considering further downside.
*   He acknowledges that the live stream wasn't very exciting, but emphasizes the importance of understanding his rules and observations.
*   He believes that his unique approach, based on tape reading and inter-market analysis, offers a different perspective from classical retail logic.
*   He provides this information on what to do, what is happening to help you learn his daily, weekly and monthly reviews.
*   He concludes the live stream, reminding viewers to permit him the benefit of hindsight and that he will try to review the morning's analysis later in the afternoon on **Twitter**.

Here's a well-structured, readable version of the provided text, retaining all details, context, and nuances while improving clarity and coherence:

# Decoding Market Movements: A Deep Dive into Price Action Analysis

## Introduction

This session aims to provide a detailed analysis of price action, focusing on specific elements and their influence on market behavior.  The concepts discussed apply to both futures and, with some adaptation, Forex markets. The video URL for reference is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSWN6YSVyFY

## The Significance of the New Day Opening Gap (NDOG)

### Definition of NDOG

The **New Day Opening Gap (NDOG)** is the difference between:

*   The closing price at **5 PM New York local time**.
*   The opening price at **6 PM New York local time**.

It's abbreviated as **NDOG**. Unlike a **New Week Opening Gap (NWOG)**, which marks the difference between Friday's close and Sunday's open, the NDOG focuses on the overnight session.

### Visual Representation and Liquidity Voids

The NDOG may or may not present as a visual gap. A **liquidity void** would be an example where the price skips over a level.

In the example provided, there's a very small change – only **one tick** – between the closing and opening prices.

### Importance of Observing NDOG

Despite its small size, the NDOG is significant because:

*   It's often overlooked by most traders.
*   The market frequently respects and reacts to this level.

### Examples of Market Respect for NDOG

As the video progresses, examples are shown:

*   **Bodies of candles respecting the NDOG level.**
*   **Candle highs and lows showing sensitivity around the NDOG.**
*   **Candle opens and closes exhibiting activity at the NDOG.**

## Time-Based Strategies: 7:00 AM to 8:30 AM New York Time

### Trading Before News Events

**7:00 AM to 8:30 AM New York local time** can be an important period to trade, especially with certain strategies. If there is going to be a news driver, one may want to trade during this period.

### News Drivers and Market Impact

The speaker frequently mentions **news drivers**, which are events that can heavily influence the market. These typically occur around **8:30 AM New York local time**. They refer to events such as:

*   Economic reports
*   Data releases
*   FOMC announcements (Federal Open Market Committee)

If the market structure looks favorable at 7:00 AM, the speaker isn't afraid to enter a trade and hold it through the 8:30 AM news driver.

### Context from the Morning on Twitter

The speaker mentioned that earlier in the morning on Twitter, they:

*   Shared their expectation for the **dollar index to rise**.
*   Indicated that **foreign currencies and ES (E-mini S&P 500 futures) were likely to fall**.
*   Stated a **bearish bias** and expected Forex and equities to seek **sell-side liquidity**.
*   Prompted followers to analyze their charts for the **New Day Opening Gap**.

Those who followed these instructions likely saw the effects of price action reacting to the NDOG.

## The Consequent Encouragement of NWOG

### Definition

The level discussed in the video is actually a **consequent encouragement** of a previous **New Week Opening Gap (NWOG)**.

### Addressing New Viewers

For viewers who are new to these concepts, the presenter recommends:

*   **Showing up every day** to learn and observe.
*   Having patience and allowing the concepts to make sense over time.
*   Focusing on learning how to read price action on a deeper, algorithmic level.

### Algorithmic Influence

The presenter argues that:

*   Prices respond to even small gaps like the NDOG.
*   Denial of this algorithmic influence is incorrect, as the market demonstrably reacts to these levels.

### Market Behavior in Relation to NDOG

*   The market ran aggressively toward the NDOG level.
*   Candle bodies respected the level as support and resistance.
*   Wicks might briefly exceed the level, but bodies tend to close near it.
*   The market then broke lower, finding consequent encouragement at a previous NWOG.

## New Week Opening Gap (NWOG) Explained

### Definition

The **New Week Opening Gap (NWOG)** is defined by:

*   The opening price on Sunday.
*   The difference between that price and the previous Friday's close.

### Characteristics

*   **Static price levels:** NWOGs are fixed once established.
*   **Universally visible:** The prices are the same for all traders.
*   **Advantage in futures:** The uniformity of pricing reduces manipulation compared to Forex.

## Addressing Forex Traders

### The Speaker's Background

The presenter notes that they started in commodities and futures before exploring Forex. They returned to their roots in futures due to the benefits offered.

### Applicability to Forex

Although the speaker is focusing on futures, the underlying price action principles are transferable to Forex.

### Advantages of Index Futures

The speaker believes index futures offer an "insider's edge" due to:

*   Unique tools and insights not widely known.
*   The ability to see the market beyond typical analysis.

### Algorithm and Fair Value

*   The **algorithm reprices back to these levels**.
*   **Fair value** is where the algorithm deems a price range hasn't been traded within enough, allowing participants to trade.

### Who Benefits from Algorithmic Pricing?

This isn't necessarily for retail traders but for a different class of trader:

*   They're not on social media selling courses.
*   They don't work for retail brokerages or big banks.
*   They utilize precise, technical science, relying on:
    *   Open, High, Low, and Close prices.
    *   Time.

### Example

The speaker notes that in one day they were looking for a market to run to a certain price point. This set the stage for them to trust that they could find a setup before the 9:30 AM opening.

## Trading Environments: Lethargic vs. News-Driven

### Preferred Conditions

The speaker states that they prefer not to trade in news environments, though they are capable of doing so.

### Teaching Philosophy

They prefer to teach new students how to:

*   Identify potentially difficult environments.
*   Exercise patience and avoid trading during those times.

### Comment from a Twitter User

A Twitter user mentioned missing a trade based on the speaker's commentary by two seconds, but otherwise had a good session. The speaker did not "like" this comment, because they had explicitly said to not be trading.

## Tape Reading and Patience

### The Need for Conditioning

The presenter emphasizes that:

*   It's too early for followers to be pushing buttons on a demo account.
*   Viewers need time to develop the skills of tape reading, wait for the correct entry to occur.

### Risk Management

They advise caution because:

*   The risks are elevated right now.
*   The market can be more difficult to read.
*   Trying to force proficiency now only makes learning harder.

### Focus on Probability

The speaker aims to teach viewers to distinguish between:

*   **High-probability conditions**: Easy to enter, predictable movement, quick targets.
*   **Low-probability conditions**: More challenging, less predictable.

### Trading and Lifestyle

The goal isn't to be chained to the charts all day, but to:

*   Quickly secure profits ("wham bam thank you man").
*   Rejoin the living and spend time with family.

## Applying the Concepts: Example Breakdown

### Key Levels

The presenter highlighted the following:

*   **4146**
*   **4134.25**

The **50% level** between these two levels is at **4140.25.**

### Scenario

Because of the breakdown in the market this morning, they were watching the low of the previous week's new week opening Gap.

### Breakdown

The speaker was watching the low of the previous week's NWOG.

### Applying NDOG

The speaker again defines the NDOG as the closing price at 5 PM and the new opening price at 6 PM, noting:

*   The difference can be significant (several handles) or minimal (one tick).
*   This level should be annotated on the chart throughout the day.
*   The algorithm refers back to this level.

### Avoiding Overwhelm

They acknowledge that this information can be overwhelming, and they emphasize:

*   Viewers who want simpler strategies like moving average crossovers are welcome to pursue them.
*   Those who truly want to understand market mechanics and algorithmic behavior have come to the right place.

### Seven O'Clock Scenario

The presenter highlighted a specific scenario:

*   There was a quick run up to the New Day Opening Gap at the 7:00 AM hour New York local time.

### Trading View Recommendation

To ensure clarity, the speaker recommends using **Trading View**, at least for learning purposes:

*   Implement Trading View for learning and tracking.
*   Transfer the analysis to your preferred trading platform.
*   Track candle identification.
*   Avoid confusion by aligning with the presenter's charts.

### Green Light

The green light from the presenter means that it is okay to trade.

### Instructions from this Morning

The speaker had prompted viewers on Twitter to:

*   Look for sell-side opportunities in futures and Forex.
*   Anticipate higher prices in the dollar.

Following this premise, they engaged in their own executions.

They looked for the market to:

*   Move away from the New Day Opening Gap.
*   Trade down to the low of the previous week's New Week Opening Gap.

## Community Engagement on Twitter

The speaker encourages viewers to:

*   Post questions on Twitter.
*   Engage with the community, which is supportive and helpful.

### Analyzing the Move

The speaker analyzed the move away from the New Week Opening Gap's low, noting:

*   Displacement to the downside.

### Opportunities Missed

They acknowledged several potential entry points:

*   Institutional order flow entry.
*   Trading back into a key level.

Ultimately, they waited for the market to trade back to the previous week's NWOG, because that was their plan.


Here's a well-structured, readable version of the provided text, retaining all details, context, and nuances while improving clarity and coherence:

# Deep Dive into Market Dynamics: Order Blocks, Fair Value Gaps, and Intermarket Analysis

## Order Blocks and Fair Value Gaps

### Identifying Fair Value Gaps After Displacement

After observing the desired displacement (a sharp move away from a level), a **fair value gap** is often created. The speaker then highlights the relationship between this fair value gap and the **New Week Opening Gap (NWOG)**.

### Addressing Order Block Misconceptions

*   The speaker clarifies misconceptions about order blocks: it's not just the last up close candle before the drop.
*   The true essence lies in the **change in the state of delivery**.
*   It has nothing to do with the candle itself but everything to do with the shift in market delivery.

### Understanding the Change in State of Delivery

The **change in the state of delivery** occurs when the market begins to deliver sell-side liquidity, and a fair value gap emerges. The focus then shifts back to the opening price. The ideal entry point is when the price trades up into this fair value gap. If the price reaches this level, it presents an opportunity for another entry.

### Managing Entries and Avoiding Missed Opportunities

*   If one waits for the order block and doesn't enter within the fair value gap, the market might respect only the fair value gap and move without them.
*   Demanding absolute "to the tick" precision can lead to missed moves.
*   The market might not always move exactly as anticipated, and being too rigid with limit orders can result in them not being filled.
*   In such cases, one might need to use a lower, closer proximity entry, even if it's not the ideal entry point.

### Revisiting a Twitter Example

The speaker references a previous **Twitter example**, noting it’s recorded and available for review, showcasing their executions.

### Identifying Specific Fair Value Gaps: SIBI

The speaker points out a specific type of fair value gap: a **SIBI (Sell-side Imbalance Buy-side Inefficiency)**.
*   They noted it in real-time but removed the indicator for clarity, wanting to see it remain open as the market moved lower.
*   The market then attacked the sell-side, setting the stage for a move into the 8:30 AM news hour.

## Trading Around News Events and Market Conditions

### Navigating the 8:30 AM News Hour

The speaker anticipated the market to drop aggressively and sharply into the 8:30 AM news hour, even though they didn't know or care what the specific news data was. They focus on the expected volatility.

### Differentiating Market Conditions: Range-Bound vs. Trending

*   **Range-Bound/Choppy Markets:** The speaker prefers to work between 7:00 AM and 8:30 AM, aiming to secure profits before the 8:30 AM news driver kicks in and targets liquidity.
*   If their analysis suggests a difficult trading market, they prefer to "eat the food when it's fresh" and leave before it gets stale.
*   The goal is efficient execution and risk management.

### Teaching Efficient Trading

The speaker aims to teach efficient use of time and risk, emphasizing the importance of trading when the market conditions are optimal.
They want to teach students to capture the best opportunities and not just trade because "trading hours are active."

### Insights from Market Replay

The speaker highlights the value of reviewing past trades, emphasizing that market replay allows one to study the logic and execution in detail.

### Post-8:30 AM Market Analysis

After 8:30 AM, the market often experiences chop and consolidation. The speaker provided real-time interpretations of the candle movements but stressed that these were **not trade setups**.

### Emphasizing Non-Trade Scenarios

Every time there was an imbalance, the speaker cautioned against taking a trade, re-emphasizing that it wasn't a setup.
They encouraged viewers to observe and study the price action without actively trading.

### Range-Bound Market Conditions

*   The speaker reminded viewers of the daily chart analysis, indicating a large range and a lack of definitive direction.
*   The speaker encouraged small, surgical intraday strikes.
*   They cautioned against selective hearing and chasing moves.

### Addressing Expectations and Drawdown

The speaker is not a "Genie in a Bottle" to fix drawdowns. They will emphasize this point, even if it's frustrating, because it is essential for learning.

### Value of Risk-Free Tape Reading

*   Engaging in risk-free tape reading is essential for learning.
*   Over time, consistent observation and confirmation will train the eye to recognize setups independently.

### Focus on Independent Trading

The speaker's goal isn't to create copycats but to foster independent traders.

## Intermarket Analysis: Dollar Index and SMT Divergence

### Analyzing Lows and the Dollar Index

The speaker advised viewers to analyze the dollar index, focusing on the relationship between the lows in Nasdaq, Dow Jones futures, and the dollar index.

### Divergence as a Key Indicator

Even when all three major averages (NQ, YM, ES) formed a lower low, there were still SMT (Smart Money Technique) divergences.

### Understanding Risk-On/Risk-Off with the Dollar Index

*   **Dollar Index Up (Risk-Off):** Foreign currencies and index futures have more freedom to drop. Rallies are difficult.
*   **Dollar Index Down (Risk-On):** Foreign currencies and index futures have more freedom to rally. Short positions are less profitable.

### Addressing Common Oversights

The speaker notes that many traders overlook this crucial intermarket relationship, even though it provides valuable insight into market sentiment.

### Real-Time Analysis

The speaker walked viewers through the live analysis, pointing out the relationships between different markets as they unfolded.

### Importance of Intermarket Relationships

Viewers should have additional charts open to toggle between, allowing them to observe intermarket relationships in real-time.

### Identifying Suspect Lows

They suspected the lows forming because they did not see follow-through on the dollar index.

### SMT Divergence Defined

The dollar index failed to make a higher high as the ES, Nasdaq, and Dow futures made a lower low at 10:12 AM, signaling an SMT divergence.

### Symmetrical Market Explained

A **symmetrical market** occurs when lower lows in Nasdaq and Dow are accompanied by a higher high in the dollar index. Any break in this correlation signals a sentiment shift.

### Real-Time Measurement

Being able to measure these relationships in real-time is essential for precision and an institutional mindset.

### Algorithmic Influence

The speaker explains that each asset (dollar index, ES, Dow, Nasdaq) runs on its own algorithm. When these algorithms are manipulated, the "crack" or divergence acts as a signal for smart money to act.

### Why These Concepts Are Effective

These concepts work because they signify the opportune moment for smart money to engage.

### Confidence in Methodology

The speaker confidently asserts the long-term effectiveness of these methods, stating they are not cherry-picked and will work consistently. They encourage viewers to compare these concepts to other, less effective approaches.

### Consequent Quotation Example

Leading up to a dollar index divergence, the speaker said he would expect the market to run buy stops back over to a certain point, and then through to the consequent quotation of the previous weeks' new week opening gap.

### Rejecting Classic Support and Resistance Logic

After that divergence, the speaker was not using classic support and resistance.

### Highlighting Specific Candles

The speaker highlights the advantages of using Camtasia (from techsmith.com) for screen recording, which allows cursor highlighting in pre-recorded videos, a feature not available in live streams using OBS.


Here's a well-structured and readable version of the provided text, retaining all details, context, and nuances while improving clarity and coherence:

# In-Depth Market Analysis: Bullish Breakers, Fair Value Gaps, and Order Blocks

## Bullish Breakers and Support/Resistance Misconceptions

### Identifying the Bullish Breaker Candle

The speaker identifies a specific candle as crucial, acknowledging potential difficulty in tracking the cursor on screen: "It's this candle right here, this up close candle. It's the highest up close bullish candle before the drop down."

*   This candle is significant because it represents a **bullish breaker**.

### Bullish Breaker Defined

*   A bullish breaker is defined by a swing high positioned between two lows. Crucially, the most recent low must be *lower*, indicating a sweep of sell stops.
*   Following this sweep, the market rallies higher, trading *through* the swing high.

### Debunking Classic Support and Resistance

The speaker challenges conventional support and resistance interpretations:

1.  **Traditional View:** If price breaks above the high of the bullish candle, then retraces to that high, it *should* act as support.
2.  **Speaker's View:** "Well, no." Instead, the speaker focuses on the *closing price* of the highest up-close candle, specifically within the high-low range of the defining candles.

### Locating the Key Candle

1.  Identify the "beefiest" (largest) up-close bullish candle. *However,* be careful!
2.  The key is the candle with the *highest closing price*. This is the bullish breaker.
3.  Enclose the entire range of this candle (from its low to its high) within a rectangle and extend it forward in time.

### Initial Assessment of the Breaker Range

Initially, the breaker range "by itself, means nothing," simply indicating a potential retracement area.

### Refining the Analysis: Fair Value Gaps Within the Breaker

The speaker shifts focus to a **fair value gap** located *within* the bullish breaker range, defined by a specific candle's high and another candle's low.

*   The speaker emphasizes that price bodies are expected to remain *inside* this fair value gap. Wicks extending beyond it are acceptable.

### The Fair Value Gap and the Breaker: A Combined View

The fair value gap resides *inside* the larger breaker range. The speaker notes that although price extends lower, the bodies of candles remain within the fair value gap's boundaries.

### Analogy: Lawn Mowing "Mohawks"

An analogy is used to explain acceptable wick extensions:

*   Imagine cutting a lawn; you want to avoid leaving uncut "Mohawks" due to misalignment.
*   The market "overshoots" slightly to avoid these "Mohawks," ensuring complete coverage. This doesn't indicate a lack of precision.

### Algorithmic Control and Market Manipulation

The speaker attributes this precision to algorithmic control, dismissing the notion of retail traders collectively adhering to these patterns. "It takes more faith to believe that than simply accepting the fact that it's a market or algorithmic."

## Real-World Example and Market Behavior

### Liquidity Pools and Targeted Levels

Following the bullish breaker confirmation, the market rallies towards a "pool of liquidity" previously identified.

### Hellcat Jailbreak Interruption and Tweeting

The speaker mentions having to leave at 10:30 AM to test drive a Hellcat Jailbreak Edition (likely purchasing it). Before leaving, they tweeted that "31 36 50 was booked to the device," indicating a target level reached.

### Post-Target Consolidation

After reaching the target, the market began to consolidate.

### Analyzing Key Levels: New Week Opening Gap

The speaker then focuses on the **New Week Opening Gap (NWOG)** levels:

*   Specifically, the *low* of the *previous* week's NWOG.
*   The market rallies to the **consequent encroachment** of the previous week's NWOG. (Consequent encroachment is the midpoint of the NWOG range.)
*   The market retraces back down to the *current* week's NWOG *low*.
*   The market rallies again to the *previous* week's NWOG.

### Wick Extensions and Algorithmic Precision Revisited

Wicks exceeding the boundaries are acceptable and demonstrate the algorithm following its code.

### Further Market Movements and Key Levels

*   The market trades lower, breaking through the consequent encroachment and the current week's NWOG.
*   Price dives towards 4128 (reference to a morning live session).
*   The market rallies, gyrating around the *previous* week's NWOG.
*   Rallies again up to the consequent encroachment, operating around the **New Day Opening Gap**.

### New Day Opening Gap

The speaker highlights the New Day Opening Gap and then drops down to consequent encroachment. Rallies into fair value gaps, then expansion to the upside runs into 4153.5. Consolidates and then Relative Equal Highs form.

## Late-Day Trading and Algorithmic Programs

### Final Hour Macro: 3:15 PM to 3:45 PM (New York Time)

The speaker highlights the importance of the last hour of trading (3:15 PM to 3:45 PM New York time), particularly a "macro run to the liquidity that has not been engaged."

### "Spooling" Analogy

The "spooling" process is explained using a fishing analogy:

*   Imagine casting a fishing rod; the line runs out as you aim to drop the lure in a specific area.
*   In this case, the lure is aimed at *buy-side liquidity* located above the current price.

### Differentiating Buy Programs from Market Maker Buy Models

The speaker clarifies the distinction between a **buy program** and a **market maker buy model**.

*   A buy program is when an algorithm starts consistently delivering price *higher*, regardless of buying or selling pressure.
*   The speaker emphasizes that algorithmic perspective trumps traditional market maker understanding.

### Algorithmic Immutability

The market will move according to its programming, irrespective of widespread bearish sentiment or volume. "It won't matter because if the Market's going to go there, it's going there."

### Buy Programs: Defined

A buy program initiates, with the market booking higher prices towards a pool of liquidity or a premium inefficiency.

### SIBI: Sell-side Imbalance Buy-side Inefficiency

The speaker identifies a **SIBI (Sell-side Imbalance Buy-side Inefficiency)**: the difference between a candle's low and another candle's high. This SIBI offered only sell-side liquidity initially.

*   To achieve an *efficient* fair value, price will reprice *up* to the SIBI range. This repricing isn't "rebalancing."
*   True balancing occurs *after* price leaves the SIBI range.

### Applying Buy Program Logic

Once a buy program begins, the market is likely to target the SIBI. The speaker refers back to the morning's live stream for a detailed explanation of the smart money's bullish shift and buy-side targets.

## Order Blocks: Beyond Simple Candle Identification

### Order Blocks and Change in the State of Delivery

The speaker strongly critiques common misconceptions about order blocks.
*   A single candle *doesn't* define an order block.
*   The *change in the state of delivery* is the key.

### Multiple Down-Closed Candles

If a series of down-closed candles exists, treat the *entire block* as a single unit of delivery.

### Precise Definition: Opening Price Trigger

1.  Identify a series of down-closed candles.
2.  Note the *opening price* of the *first* candle in the series (e.g., 41.45.75).
3.  The *moment* price trades *one tick above* that opening price, the "change in the state of delivery" occurs.
4.  *That* opening price becomes fair value.

### Algorithmic Hammering

High-frequency algorithms actively buy at this fair value level whenever price retraces to it.

### Building Positions

Each new "change in the state of delivery" provides algorithms with another opportunity to build (enlarge) their positions.

### Draw on Liquidity

The ultimate focus remains on the "draw on liquidity" (the target), which is where the market is heading.

### The Market as a Beast

The speaker emphasizes that the market seeks liquidity and fair value, constantly oscillating between the two to facilitate the most efficient price delivery.

### Priming

*Priming* is when an algo does something to create the expectation of a specific outcome.

### 2022 Model

This is when the speaker explains a 2022 model. He went through each step of the model. Then he showed a shift in market structure after liquidity is taken. It is designed to show where smart money engages, getting in early.

### Re-iterating Concepts

Then the speaker uses real-world situations to re-iterate these concepts. Each re-iteration shows a deeper understanding of the concepts.


Here's a well-structured and readable version of the provided text, retaining all details, context, and nuances while improving clarity and coherence:

# Mastering Market Macros, Algorithmic Control, and Independent Trading

## Understanding the 3:15 PM - 3:45 PM Macro

### The Essence of the Macro
The speaker explains the **macro** that occurs between **3:15 PM and 3:45 PM New York time (EST)**, addressing what makes it significant:

*   **Bullish Market Scenario:** In a bullish market, after a significant run-up and the establishment of the day's high, price typically pulls back from the highs during this time, closing near but not at the high.
*   **Consolidation Breakout:** When the market is attempting to break out of a consolidation (as outlined earlier on the daily chart), it will start probing outside those boundaries.
*   **Targeting Liquidity:** The speaker indicates they tipped listeners off about the market reaching for a specific high that morning, particularly because it had already made multiple attempts to go lower.
*   **Exploiting Short Sellers:** The market may be catching traders who are selling short.

### Applying the Macro in Trading
The speaker stresses the importance of knowing the market's directional bias and focusing on specific times of day where these macros are present.

*   **Market on Close:** The **3:15 PM - 3:45 PM macro** is a **"market on close"** phenomenon, causing a price run towards the end of the day.
*   **Patience and Setup:** If a clear setup isn't evident, the advice is to *do nothing* and wait until 15-20 minutes before 4:00 PM, where a 5-10 "handle" (price movement) run might occur.
*   **Systematic and Generic:** The speaker describes this final hour trading approach as systematic, generic, and even boring, but highly consistent for traders seeking repeatable patterns.

### Algorithmic Influence and Market Reality
The speaker addresses skepticism, emphasizing the algorithmic control of the market.

*   **Coded Behavior:** If you've followed the speaker's teachings, you'll see the chart printing exactly what was taught, because it's coded to do so.
*   **Indoctrination vs. Experience:** The speaker acknowledges that those working in traditional financial institutions may be indoctrinated to perceive price differently.
*   **Proven Daily:** The speaker asserts they are proving how these markets are "booking" daily with every single one-minute candle.
*   **Relaxing into the Reality:** It's beneficial to accept that the market is "rigged" or algorithmically driven.

### Redefining Trading Success

The speaker challenges conventional retail trading beliefs.

*   **Mythical Edge:** Fear over-trading, over-leveraging, and relying on a "mythical edge" based on retail trading patterns.
*   **Being on Side:** When retail traders make money, it's often because they "happen to be on side" (in the right direction) at the right time.
*   **Money Management is Key:** Effective money management (cutting losses, letting winners run) is what makes most retail traders profitable, not necessarily superior trading strategies.
*   **Low Strike Rate Tolerance:** Many successful retail traders have surprisingly low strike rates.

### Aiming for Mastery, Not Just Profitability

The speaker expresses dissatisfaction with a low strike rate and wants students to aim for more.

*   **Knowing When to Act:** Learn when to trade, when to avoid trading, and when to anticipate difficulty.
*   **Avoiding Recklessness:** Knowing when things will be difficult can prevent over-trading, over-leveraging, and revenge trading after a loss.
*   **Peace of Mind and Control:** This knowledge provides peace of mind and control over one's trading.

## The Mentorship: Beyond Simple Buy/Sell Signals

### Focus on Understanding, Not Just Signals
The speaker defines the purpose of the mentorship program.

*   **Beyond Basic Signals:** It's *not* just about providing buy/sell signals, stop-loss levels, or profit targets (which are already available on the speaker's YouTube channel).
*   **Essential But Uncomfortable:** The mentorship focuses on the *required* (though often uncomfortable) elements for doing well in trading.
*   **Understanding *Why* You're On Side:** It's not just about getting lucky and being on the right side of a trade; it's about understanding *why*.
*   **Perceiving Price Correctly:** The goal is to teach how to perceive price at its most opportune times and avoid it when conditions aren't favorable.

### The Hot Pan Analogy
The speaker uses a "hot pan" analogy to illustrate the importance of caution.

*   **Assessing the Risk:** Before touching a potentially hot pan, you assess the risk by feeling for heat waves, avoiding a burn.
*   **Rushing In Blindly:** Rushing into trading without proper knowledge is like a child grabbing a hot pan and getting burned.

### Avoiding Toxic Thinking and Fear

The speaker addresses the mindset challenges in trading.

*   **Rushing the Process:** Avoid rushing into funded accounts, live trading, or even demo accounts, as it can reinforce toxic thinking and fear.
*   **Respect Risks, Not Fear:** Respect the risks involved in trading, but don't be fearful of being wrong.
*   **Learning from Mistakes:** The instances where you're wrong are where you'll learn the most.
*   **Embrace Uncertainty:** Press into the uncertainty instead of avoiding it.

### Building Confidence and a Proper Mindset

The speaker describes the transformation that comes with understanding.

*   **Overcoming Fear:** Once you learn, you become unafraid of uncertainty, knowing that similar setups will repeat in the future.
*   **Fortifying the Mindset:** It's difficult to build this mindset in the beginning when you lack knowledge and understanding.
*   **Avoiding Mimicry:** Don't simply copy strategies you've seen others use (e.g., trading fair value gaps or order blocks) without truly understanding them.

## Aims for 2024: Independent, Knowledgeable Traders

### Empowering Traders for the Future
The speaker outlines their goals for the audience.

*   **Independent Minded Traders:** By 2024, the aim is for everyone to be an independently minded trader.
*   **Personal Model Mastery:** Each person should know their trading model inside and out.
*   **Unaffected by Influencers:** They won't be swayed by social media influencers, including the speaker.
*   **Self-Sufficient Learning:** There will be no need to constantly return to the speaker's channel for answers or support.
*   **Goal of Self-Sufficiency:** The speaker's ultimate goal is to make their students self-sufficient.

### Closing Remarks
The speaker concludes by expressing hope that the audience learned something and announces their return for another live stream tomorrow.

Here's the reorganized and refined version of the provided text.

# **Market Analysis and Trading Strategy: February 25, 2023**

**(Audio Check)**

Just doing an audio check. Okay, we're doing pretty good latency.

**(Date)**

Saturday, February 25th, 2023

**(Risk Disclaimer)**

Take a look at this risk disclaimer.

## **Dollar Index Analysis (Daily Chart)**

We're looking at the dollar index on a daily chart.

### **Key Advice for New Students**

When reviewing charts with minimal annotations:

*   Pause the video stream.
*   Analyze the chart based on conceptual understandings, including:
    *   **Order Blocks**
    *   **Fair Value Gaps**
    *   Potential **Liquidity Points**
*   Your chart should ideally already reflect these elements, but this is for new students who will watch this later.

### **Current Market Position**

*   We have moved from the highs of the fall (October 2022) down to the sell side.
*   This market trend was largely anticipated and analyzed live.
*   It was expected that the price would reach a **fair value gap** (a by-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency) and hit an **order block**.
*   If the price had moved below the low target, it might have reached the **consequent encroachment** (midpoint of the gap).

### **Historical Price Action**

*   **Market Maker Shift Bullish:** Around this area.
*   **Bullish Breaker:** This is annotated on the chart.
    *   Consolidated higher
    *   Order block (lowest body candle)
    *   Price traded down into it and rallied.
*   This analysis is a review of past events but has been discussed live in real-time, minute-by-minute.

### **Anticipated Future Movement**

Focus attention on the area above where the price is heading towards.

## **Range Analysis**

*   **High to Low Range:** Measured from the high to the low.
*   **Equilibrium:** Halfway point of the range.
*   **Premium:** Area above the equilibrium.

### **Premium Fair Value Gap (Sell-Side Imbalance, Buy-Side Inefficiency)**

*   This is represented by a single down candle that delivered inefficiently.
*   If the dollar continues beyond this area, it’s going to be looking at the next near-term objective, the draw on liquidity.

### **Implications of Dollar Rally**

Throughout this period, higher prices for the dollar were anticipated. This implies:

*   Lower prices for index futures.
*   Lower prices for the Euro/Dollar.
*   Lower prices for Cable (Pound/Dollar).
*   Lower prices for all foreign currencies.
*   Lower stock prices.
*   This scenario represents **risk-off sentiment**.
*   Risk-off means that all assets (foreign currency, indexes, stocks) are easier to capitalize on with short positions. Sell programs are initiated, while the dollar stays in a buy program.

### **Contingency Planning**

If the dollar breaks above the current level, it is something that will have to be monitored.
The prevailing belief is that the dollar is still trending upwards.
The ultimate decisive failure point of the dollar's upward trend will be communicated, should it occur.
For now, a specific target level is anticipated to be reached.

## **Zooming In: Volume Imbalance Analysis**

### **Target Area**

The area right above these two highs is critical.
There is a significant **volume imbalance** in this area.

### **Understanding Volume Imbalance**

*   Volume imbalance occurs where two candles are separated by only their wicks, with no overlapping bodies.
*   The body of one candle does not overlap with the body of the previous candle.
*   Even if wicks bridge the gap, it's not enough; the bodies must overlap.
*   If bodies do not overlap, it is considered inefficient, and price tends to retrace back to it.
*   The algorithm views wicks as gaps.
*   There has been no body overlap in this area, only wicks passing through.
*   This is why the focus has been on this area for dollar strength.

### **Intraday Chart Considerations**

*   This topic often arises from students, including long-term ones.
*   Intraday charts (1-minute, 5-minute) can be challenging for quick decision-making.
*   New traders may struggle to internalize candle formations due to rapid changes.
*   Daily, 4-hour, or 1-hour charts provide more time for candle completion and analysis.
*   Price fluctuations are the same regardless of the timeframe.
*   The frame of reference is important for identifying setups.
*   Knowing the time frame you're trading in helps avoid confusion and ensures you're working with the correct setup.
*   This caters to students not equipped for lower timeframes, either due to preference, personality, or work constraints.

## **Trading Style Considerations**

*   **Intraday Traders:** Quick, short-term positions.
*   **Swing Traders:** Longer-term positions, focusing on broader trends.
*   The analysis is designed to work for both types of traders.
*   The direction of the market is identified and then individual trading strategies are used to trade with the predicted bias.
*   A daily chart is predominantly used as the higher timeframe, used for finding key levels.
*   The weekly chart (not included) is used for range determination.
*   Everything being discussed can be accomplished using the daily chart, negating the need for the weekly chart.
*   The weekly chart is usually reviewed on the weekend, either Friday or Saturday.
*   The goal is to determine the likely movement of the weekly candle in terms of distance and magnitude.

## **Weekly Chart Implications**

Without showing the weekly chart, it is stated that there's an expectation that the next weekly candle will try to gravitate to a specific area.
By having this perspective on price action, one will not get confused and lose their bearings where they are in price on lower timeframe charts.

## **Benefits of Higher Timeframe Perspective**

*   Day traders and scalpers zoomed in on charts with 15-20 candles can be surprised by unexpected movements.
*   Anticipating price movements eliminates surprises.
*   The expectation is that price will deliver in accordance with long-term analysis.

## **Trading Goal Mindset**

*   The number one goal should be getting to a specific level.
*   It's not about the amount affordable on a trade or passing funded account challenges quickly.
*   Focusing on quick profits and funded account challenges often leads to failure.

## **Target Area Details**

*   The speaker is going to break down more details in a few minutes.
*   Expansion is expected to be delivered sometime this week.
*   It is possible that the price could gap up there or here.
*   It is also possible that the price has a very small change.
*   There could be a small retrace.
*   The area above the two highs has a significant **volume imbalance**, meaning there are no bodies between the candles.
*   The bodies of the candles do not touch each other.
*   Those highs are relatively equal.

## **Support and Resistance Analysis**

*   **Retail Traders:** Utilize support and resistance strategies.
*   Price goes up to this level here and moves lower, trades up higher again falls short of this one, but drops precipitously away from it, leaving this area to traders.
*   Some traders perceive this area as a ceiling or resistance.
*   There will be **buy stops** resting above that.

### **Types of Buy Stops**

*   **Breakout Traders:** Watching for a break above the level to go long.
*   **Large Fund Positions:** Holding buy stops to protect short positions.
*   The latter is the predominant reason for the price to move to this area.
*   Large fund liquidity is a key driver, and retail books are often aligned with large fund stop placement.
*   Easy above old highs and below old lows.
*   Clean levels are often targeting areas where the highs are relatively the same.

### **Personal Trading Philosophy**

*   Earlier in his trading career, the speaker viewed such levels as resistance and went short, but doesn't view it that way anymore.
*   Levels are now targeted and the trading strategies are framed to trade into these levels.

## **Dollar Index as a Barometer**

*   The speaker does not trade the dollar index directly.
*   It is used as a barometer to determine whether to buy or sell the S&P or currencies other than the dollar.
*   If the dollar is rallying, other assets (S&P, currencies) will likely drop.
*   This provides a macro perspective on risk-on/risk-off sentiment.
*   This alleviates uncertainty for new, struggling, or unprofitable traders.
*   Many traders fail because they don't incorporate the daily chart in their analysis.
*   Small movements in price can lead to over-leveraging due to a lack of understanding of market direction.
*   A longer-term perspective aids in holding trades longer.

## **Trading Strategy and Goals**

*   Focus is on actively pursuing five handles, which are 20 ticks in the S&P.
*   The same price action concepts work in Forex as well.
*   The daily chart helps maintain frame of reference within the macro view.
*   The daily chart indicates where the price is likely to go.
*   The speaker looks at the weekly chart before the week begins, whether it be Friday or Saturday or Sunday.
*   The speaker tries to determine the likelihood of that weekly candle to expand higher or lower based on whatever that weekly chart is showing him.
*   If the weekly chart showed a certain pattern, the speaker would know to expect that the next weekly candle is going to open up and try to gravitate to a certain area.
*   This same insight is illustrated using the daily chart.

## **Conclusion**

*   It's better to submit to the idea that the higher timeframe charts like weekly and daily, are going to tell traders where the biggest odds are for price getting to a specific level.
*   This should be the number one goal of your analysis.
*   It's not about how much you can afford on your next trade or how much money you have to make to pass your funded account challenge, or how many trades you can do it in two days and get your funded account passed.
*   Focusing on the wrong thing will ensure that you fail.
*   The way to pass those challenges is to follow the market analysis guidelines above.


Here's the reorganized and refined version of the provided text:

# **Market Analysis: Consistency, Setups, and Daily Chart PD Arrays**

## **Finding Consistency and Favorable Setups**

The key to finding consistency and setups that work in your favor lies in understanding what the daily chart **PD arrays** are indicating. This involves identifying:

*   Where the **liquidity** is.
*   Where the **inefficiencies** are.
*   Whether there's any inefficiency from a specific high point downwards that should be considered.

The closing price on Friday is an important consideration. The analysis this week will delve into this. Prior to that, any previous inefficiencies have already been addressed. This directs attention to an old high.

## **Specific Price Levels and the Rejection Block**

Before reaching the current level, three specific levels were identified as important:

1.  The high of a specific candle.
2.  (More accurately) The **S&P 500's (SPX)** closing price, which is taught as a **rejection block**.

Just because it's named "rejection block" does not mean that there is a bearish sentiment, and no bearishness was mentioned concerning the dollar index. The dollar index is bullish with the expectation of moving upwards into a specific area and this is based on the need for market efficiency between the closing price of one candle and the opening price of another. There's unfinished business between these two candles.

### **Anticipated Market Behavior**

The market is likely (though not guaranteed) to move upwards and create a candle with its body crossing between the low and high of the shaded area. The candle could go higher and then retract to stop in the middle. Placing a candle body between these two price points is sufficient.

### **Range of Opportunity**

The current position is not even in this area, opening up possibilities. A range exists from roughly 105.26 to 105.90, about 50 points for the dollar. This translates to a greater number of pips for short positions on **Pound/Dollar (GBP/USD)** and **Euro/Dollar (EUR/USD)**. This presents potential for downside range when shorting these foreign currencies and will be reviewed for Euro/Dollar in this presentation, immediately after reviewing the dollar.

## **Routine, Focus, and Objectives**

A routine is established, focusing on specific elements, including why it's believed that the price will increase. The first objective (the rejection block) has already been achieved.

### **Bearish Scenario (Hypothetical)**

If a bearish scenario were being considered, that price point would be used to look for a displacement lower. *However*, the intent is *not* to convey that the dollar will go lower here.

*Because* the level is named a **rejection block**, it would be used in a bearish context, *if* the market were to trade through the closing price of an old swing high, and then show displacement (piercing a short-term one-minute or five-minute candlestick swing low, not necessarily closing below it). With a fair value gap above, the 2022 model would be used to go short.

In this case, given the bullish outlook on the dollar, the rejection block only serves as a target. It's an option for determining what to do after the dollar reaches that level (which was previously tweeted and has been watched for weeks).

### **Trading Actions Upon Reaching the Rejection Block**

Once the dollar hits that level, consideration should be given to:

*   Euro/Dollar
*   Pound/Dollar
*   Foreign currency trades
*   S&P 500 (short)
*   NASDAQ (short)
*   Dow (short)
*   DAX
*   Any asset other than the dollar

If the dollar is rising and reaches this area, it may be a good time to take partial profits, as the price could then consolidate.

### **Post-Rejection Block Targets**

The next target is the **consequent encroachment**, which is the midpoint of the candle's wick. Because the wick represents a gap, the market will likely gravitate back to the midpoint, representing the imbalance between the high and low of the wick.

The market was just below that level as of Friday's close, and it is hoped that the price will gap to it (or slightly above it) on Sunday. This is preferred. Failing that, it should retest the level and then go higher.

This specifies exactly what is wanted, and if those conditions aren't met, nothing will be done. There is no need to rush decisions, no confusion, and no being lost in price action. If something doesn't make sense based on set concepts, it will be avoided. This is the mindset that's being taught.

These conceptual ideas cannot be adequately communicated in a short, condensed five-minute training video. There's too much to cover and you can't compress it.

### **Comprehensive Learning and Avoiding Failure**

Learning *how* to trade has already been taught, including *how* to look for setups. The problem is that students are not listening to these longer types of lectures. You have to know *why* you're doing it and understand *why* you shouldn't do *other* things.

By adopting a holistic approach to understanding price action, a complete understanding of high and low-probability setups will be gained. The next objective is the 105.341 level, followed by the wick high.

## **Volume Imbalance and Market Sentiment**

If the price is going to reach those levels, it makes sense for the candles to eventually gravitate into the shaded area representing the **volume imbalance**.

Considerations:

*   Rumors of war and international conflict.
*   Cause concern, prompting the market to seek yield in a safe haven.
*   This is expressed by higher dollar prices as a flight to quality.

This situation is causing nervousness because people are witnessing the dollar rise.

### **Buy-Side Liquidity**

The relatively equal highs are likely holding a large liquidity pool of buy stops. Those long on the dollar would benefit from seeing the price increase, allowing them to sell their long positions to the market at a higher price. This buy-side liquidity is likely the next target.

There's a small range between the candle's low and high. There are several factors:

*   Relatively equal highs
*   No bodies in the volume imbalance
*   Small separation between the candle's low and high

### **Additional Areas of Interest**

If the shaded area is entered at any point during the week, an additional area will be monitored: the area between the high and low of a specific candle. There is a small gap there.

If the price goes *above* that, and it becomes animated, the wick's halfway point (consequent encroachment) comes into play. The **implied fair value gap** would also be considered.

If the consequent encroachment range of *both* wicks is projected out, and the price goes through that, a very bullish dollar should be expected, which would signify bad outcomes for other assets.

### **Current Bias**

Currently, focus is on the two levels mentioned and the volume imbalance. The bias is bullish on the dollar. Everything else bends the knee and goes lower. This perspective has been maintained throughout February: long dollar, short S&P 500, short NASDAQ, short Euro/Dollar, short Pound/Dollar, and short everything else.

## **Intraday Analysis: Hourly Chart**

Here's the hourly chart, showing Friday's action. This assumes awareness of the target: the rejection block. The price moved down here, then rose to the consequent encroachment of the wick.

There are three levels shown:

*   Heavy dashed line: **Rejection block** (candle's closing price).
*   Dotted red line: **Consequent encroachment** of the wick.
*   Heavy thick red line: High of the candle's wick.

### **Friday's Price Action**

On Friday, the price quickly ran up to the rejection block, got very close to the consequent encroachment of the wick (the dotted red line), and then consolidated.

### **Consolidation Factors**

Consolidation occurred inside this high, because:

*   The S&P 500 reached an objective.
*   The dollar failed to confirm that lower low in the S&P 500. This represents a **USDX (Dollar Index) SMT (Smart Money Technique)**.

It was also Friday. The price ramped up quickly in pre-market, then did very little. Those who were trading likely became frustrated. These are instances where those who don't understand market dynamics can become angry and lose money.

### **Cautionary Note**

Be careful of pushing an agenda, especially on a Friday, given the current "saber-rattling." Anything can happen.

The price could have easily hit the consequent encroachment (the dotted red line, the midpoint of the daily wick). The fact that it failed to confirm the higher high and lower low in the dollar and S&P 500 (demonstrated further in this lecture) calls for caution. This also set the stage for a lunchtime consolidation or reversal.

### **Low Resistance Liquidity Runs**

This sudden ramp up in price is a **low resistance liquidity run**, versus a move with high resistance. Focusing on this difference is what is being taught, as well as knowing what high resistance is and when *not* to trade in it. Also is taught where low resistance liquidity runs develop in price action.

### **High vs. Low Resistance Trading**

Visually speaking, what type of trade would you rather be in? If you were trying to be long (assuming any market other than the dollar):

*   Buying in an area with lots of back and forth, risking being stopped out.
*   Buying in an area with a straight, uninterrupted rally upwards.

Every trader wants the latter. This is what books don't teach.

### **Market Difficulty and Emotional Control**

The market *can* be difficult in terms of getting to desired price levels. Scalping is still possible.

Once you know how to do what is being taught this year, you can trade in difficult markets. This is shown via Twitter, including calling every turning point.

You will have the skillset to identify these movements and avoid choppy days. You'll remain cool, calm, and collected, avoiding the emotional roller coaster that drives many traders.

The markets are vehicles to make money. If you can't identify that as the root cause of why you're here, you're probably doing this for all the wrong reasons.

## **15-Minute Time Frame Analysis**

Now, let's move into the 15-minute time frame.


Here is the re-organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining all original details and context:

# **15-Minute Time Frame Analysis: Buy-Side and Sell-Side Imbalances**

In the 15-minute time frame, we can observe a **buy-side and balanced sell-side inefficiency**, which is highlighted in the small blue box. This spans from this candle's high to this candle's low.

*   Interestingly, if you zoom into a lower time frame, such as a one-minute chart, you'll find a smaller fair value gap.
*   The price has been interacting within this gap.
*   The market fell just short of reaching the **105.341 level**, corresponding to the **consequent encroachment** (midpoint) of that daily wick.

The consolidation within this area influenced traders. The level mentioned here is based on this specific high and low.

## **Fibonacci Analysis and Standard Deviations**

If the market sentiment is bullish, you have the option to pause the video and independently conduct this analysis.

*   Take your Fibonacci tool and apply it from this low to this high.
*   Identify a standard deviation that aligns with this level, which is the consequent encroachment, positioned slightly below or above it.

When you execute this, you'll observe that the Fibonacci from low to high results in a negative 1.5 standard deviation precisely at that point.

*   Draw this out over time.

When I alerted via Twitter that the dollar wasn't confirming the low established in the S&P 500, once the S&P 500 genuinely achieved its objective, this particular region indicated a likely intraday high.

*   This means we were likely to either consolidate or retrace back into this wick.
*   There was a possibility of it descending further into this area, particularly if it had declined more during the lunch hour into the PM session on Friday.

### **Anticipating Market Behavior: Friday's Lunch Hour**

I anticipated this and prompted you to observe the time, noting that we were approaching the New York lunch hours on Friday. It's typical for the market to either consolidate or retrace against stops during these hours. However, we were very close to reaching higher timeframe objectives. What was more probable? A retrace.

*   Why would it need to retrace to reach that level?
*   If it began to mark time here, it was less likely to retrace.
*   This meant it would likely consolidate into the close, holding everyone in this position, which is precisely what transpired.

The Euro, Pound, S&P 500, and NASDAQ all retraced.

### **Precision and Experience**

We demonstrate precision here, but it's also a matter of experience. You must discern when continuation is truly likely. It's Friday, and we've already witnessed significant upward movement before the 9:30 opening.

*   All this movement occurred prior to 9:30 AM.

If you only trade at 9:30, you're going to miss moves. If you're not trading around 8:30, you're going to miss moves. If you're not trading overnight in the London session (down here), I didn't catch this move; I was sleeping.

You must accept that you can't capture every move, and be content with the analysis being accurate. You're going to miss moves, folks.

*   That's simply the way it is.
*   Just as you'll experience losing trades and money, it's part of the business.
*   No one can participate in every swing.

Let's continue this comfortable-like atmosphere.

## **Euro/Dollar: Daily Chart Analysis**

Now, let's transition to the Euro/Dollar daily chart and accelerate a bit, as I want to keep this video concise.

*   Right away, pause the video and note the levels that are important to you.
*   Those disinterested are not obligated to do so.
*   For viewers watching this video at a later time, you can perform this analysis independently.

I mentioned that when we were bullish on the Euro and bearish on the dollar, this area appeared too clean and smooth.

*   We anticipated a trade up into this small area.
*   Ultimately, the market would ascend into this region.
*   As fate would have it, the market traded beautifully into that level.

### **Prior Analysis and Market Reversals**

I'm aware that some of you may perceive this as "cherry-picked." However, revisit this YouTube channel, and you'll find pre-emptive analyses where I discussed all this before it happened.

*   As the dollar declined to our objective, it reversed, causing the Euro to reverse, trading lower.
*   This high, low, higher high moved to a level we were targeting.
*   Once it breaks below that low right here (that low is broken there) and *if* it had done this and then rebounded, that would still be a shift in market structure and therefore bearish. But, because it *closed* below…

**Critical Note Taking Point**:

If you're merely binge-watching with a Netflix and chill attitude towards ICT, you're not learning, and you're wasting your time. If we *close* below the swing like that, you're going to treat that as a **breaker**.

*   You won't need to anticipate a return up into this imbalance.
*   Did you hear what was just said? A diamond was just dropped.

That breaker is touched right here. Does it respect it? Yes, it does. We're bullish on the dollar, and it's trading to a bearish breaker. This candle, upon hitting it, will act as your resistance.

### **Support and Resistance Theory: A Refined Perspective**

You can't merely look at every swing high and swing low, draw a line, and assume it will act as support or resistance, folks. That's not how it works. You need a narrative explaining *why* that particular high or low should function as resistance.

*   Examine instances where a pool of liquidity was raided and rejected.
*   In this case, the low before that high was formed constitutes a bearish breaker.
*   That's logical, real logic, not simply drawing lines on every swing high and low.

Following the latter method will lead to frustration, as it did for me, and result in failure for those who employ that garbage.

*   If you believe the statistics (which I think are accurate), most new traders lose their account within the first 90 days.
*   However, there's someone on the other side of those losing trades who is winning by doing the opposite of whatever those losing traders are doing.

You can't just look at every high and low, draw lines, and expect it to lead you to riches. It doesn't work that way. You need a reason *why* a level should act as resistance and *why* it should behave as support, predicated on liquidity.

*   Has it harmed traders with existing orders above highs or below old lows?
*   Once that occurs, that's *why* I call it a breaker.

I named it the breaker because it broke the backs of everyone who likely already tried to sell short here. It started to drop, and then rethrone, breaking their future profitable short.

*   That's why I named it the breaker.
*   It's breaking them, their will, and their courage.

They won't re-enter when it goes down here; they'll be like deer in headlights, distrusting everything, demoralized, and having lost money. Retail traders freeze when they lose money, which, again, breaks their spirit and the winning position they would have had if they hadn't been stopped out right there (baby profit right now).

### **Smart Money Perspective and Liquidity Pools**

I'm sure many traders were trying to do that in here because they looked at these highs over here and drew a line, similar to what I have here. However, my line was to identify the buy-side; there are orders above that. I want to see it go above those. I *don't* want to see it go there and act as resistance and go down.

Many trades went in there, and as it hit that level, they went short, placing their stop loss somewhere up here randomly. The market goes right to a level I gave you with a reason *why* it should go there, and then it does the dirty work of going lower.

For smart money traders unable to get short up here, they get another opportunity. They find another bus stop; here it is: the breaker. It comes right back up, hits it, and they sell short, and now we're moving lower.

## **Sell-Side Liquidity and Market Dynamics**

Now, I have this level resting below that, representing sell stops or sell-side liquidity. From this high to this low, the midpoint is equilibrium right here. So, at that level and above, we are in a premium. The next draw on liquidity is this low.

*   Real orders are resting below that low.
*   What kind of orders? Sell stops.

Why would it be beneficial for the market to trade to that level? Because they've already taken buy stops here and over here, and we moved sharply lower.

*   We have to assume internal dialogue.
*   We assume that someone with deep pockets and big short positions is holding to get to a level where there are a lot of willing sellers below market price.

They want to see the market drop from this height here and go down below this low here.

*   Why would they want that?
*   Once the orders get tripped below this low (as soon as this candle drops down, or the next candle, or sometime in the future—it may not be this week; I could be wrong), every sell stop at that price level becomes a market order to sell at the market.
*   It's tripping a rush of liquidity in the form of a great deal of sellers at low prices.

### **Smart Money Strategy: Buying Back at Low Prices**

What do you do when you go to the store, see something on sale, and you have the money for it? You buy it, right?

To exit the short position smart money is holding from up here, they're going to want to buy it back.

*   Are they just going to buy it back because it's made 20 ticks?
*   Are they going to buy it because they made 500 points/ticks/pips?

No. They're looking for logic behind where the market is going and where it resides, where there's a large degree of contrarian opinion.

*   Sell stops protecting long positions are what's going to be targeted here.
*   That's what's in sight right now.

It's advantageous for us as speculators to believe and trust that it's going to go below that low because there's somebody making money right now.

*   We don't know who they are.
*   We don't care to know.
*   We don't need to know how much they're making.

But they're making money, and this type of move is meaningful because it's dropped a lot.

*   Where's it going? Some random level?
*   No. Where there's an obvious level for sell stops resting below this low here.

They sold short to buy stops, so they sold at high prices and are going to buy back at low prices where existing or engineered liquidity will be resting.

## **Engineering Liquidity**

This area here, where it runs up and drops down, that's engineering liquidity.

*   When does engineered liquidity form?
*   Here's another time for your journal: Between here and all the way back here, that's a lot of time.

What happens? It takes up to that level, falls short of it, and drops down, and traders do what? They go short, which inspires them to do what? Place buy stops resting above here.

*   When the price gets delivered up there, that's that series of orders that would be resting above these highs here, plus large fund orders up here because they're going to trade longer term.

The inefficiency of this area here that's shaded, that's a fair value gap. All of those boxes get checked.

*   When that happens, smart money, the way I'm teaching you how to decipher price, engage price, and see the real market (not patterns, not retail stuff), you're looking at it with a market efficiency paradigm.
*   That perspective is you're looking for the fluctuations and delivery of price to do exactly how I'm teaching you.

It doesn't trade because there are patterns, whether they're classic patterns or New Wave harmonic animal patterns (which is absolutely ridiculous). The market only operates on time and price, and it's going for where the orders are resting, which is above old highs or below old lows, or it's rebalancing areas of inefficiency in price, which is what I'm shading you in this little box right here.

## **Future Outlook and Trading Strategy**

Our thought process is going forward:

*   We're still holding with a higher dollar and a lower Euro.
*   We're going to be monitoring how we trade at this low here.

As long as we remain below this breaker, we're bearish. I'm bearish on Euro, expecting that low to be taken out. Very simple, isn't it?

What's your bias going forward for the week?

*   Looking for lower prices on Euro/Dollar.
*   Looking for higher prices on the dollar.

Simple. If we get animated, as Morales mentioned earlier with the dollar, if the dollar gets really explosive on the upside, say something happens on the other side of the world and you know what I'm talking about, that could cause the market to do a whole lot of things, and one would be the dollar going up a lot. If that happens...

## **Discount Fair Value Gap (FVG)**

That discount fair value gap in the form of a box, out of balance, outside and deficiency, which is busy. That's one candle moving up with the previous candle's high being lower than it, and the next candle's low being higher than the previous candle's high.

*   That separation between those two candles with this one candle is a fair value gap.
*   What specific style of theory? I got busy, buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency, equilibriums here.

If it wants to go to a discount, that's where my eye is right here.

*   I'm giving you my longer-term viewpoint out in time.
*   But right now, all I'm focusing on is here and how we trade to it.
*   Do we just shallowly go below it and retrace back up in the range, or do we smash through it and just really accelerate?

That's what I'm waiting to see. But my 100% focus is we're going here as my bias, and below it. That's what I'm thinking with a higher dollar. That's not ambiguous.

## **Euro/Dollar: Hourly Chart Analysis**

Here's the hourly chart on Euro, and you can see that we've been moving lower. I'm not going to give you the lower low, lower high crap because that's not market structure; that's just a trend.

*   But what we do is we like to look back in all of the delivery of price right in here.
*   I have no annotations on these charts because I'm counseling you to do it on yours.

Right in here, you have a fair value gap in the form of a city. So, it's on a balanced, buy-side efficiency.

### **Institutional Order Flow Entry Drill (IOFED)**

This candle's high right here, if you draw a line out, this is an **institutional order flow entry drill**.

*   The institutional order flow entry drill is where the market just trades this a little bit inside the fair value gap and then drops.
*   That's what that is.
*   It's not a full closure of the gap. It just goes in a little bit and then goes.

That's why when you see me pyramiding and when I'm doing my trade executions, every single time I do an entry into the fair value gap, I'm always trying to pyramid right there. Because every time I try to fancy dance and try to get the midpoint/consequent encroachment, I rarely ever get it.

*   That may be where I believe that the ideal entry should be for me.
*   But I don't care about the couple of ticks that I might be losing in terms of profit or saving in a stop loss; that's not going to make or break the idea for a trade for me.

As it enters the fair value gap, **institutional workflow entry drill (usually abbreviated by IOFED in my chart)** all that means is you're entering just the smallest little bit inside of a fair value gap, and you're entering based on that within a narrative or directional bias with the belief that even if it does close in the fair value gap entirely, it doesn't make a difference; it won't hurt me. I'm not going to take the full position there; I'm going to enter a partial of something like a pyramid.

If I'm going to enter it as a full 100…


Here is the re-organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining all original details and context:

# **Trading Analysis: Focus, Inefficiencies, and Liquidity**

## **Understanding Market Movements and Avoiding Common Pitfalls**

This is the first time I'm entering this trade because it may have already moved for a while. I'm not afraid of shorting here, even if some might think we're near support. They might assume it will go up, but they have no idea because they are lost on the higher time frame. They're trying to go long on the Euro, searching for long positions when they should be filtering out longs and focusing on shorts.

*   Every time the market rallies, the thought process should be: "This is a suspect rally."
*   Why is it going up? Here are the only two reasons:
    *   Tagging short-term highs for buy stops.
    *   Returning to reprice to an inefficiency.

## **Identifying Inefficiencies and Exploiting Bearish Market Conditions**

This high ran above this high, and this high ran above this high. There's a small separation here, which is fine. It breaks lower. What's this rally doing?

*   Addressing an inefficiency right here.
*   The wick splits in half - that's inefficiency. Wicks are gaps.

Any time you're bearish (listen closely), you've overcomplicated things. People say I complicate things, turn it into a science. All you need to do is know the language, simple processes, and rules.

*   If we are bearish based on what we think the weekly chart will do (expanding higher or lower for a seen objective), that's the beginning of building a bias for the week (not daily, but weekly).

That means we're only looking for buys if we think the weekly chart will print a candle expanding higher. Right away, you don't care about going short, who's making money on social media, nothing will influence you, and you're following your methodology.

*   You'll know when you're wrong, and you won't be confused. It just didn't pan out, or you did something wrong. Keep moving forward.

If you chase everyone else's opinion and they're wrong, it's frustrating because you don't know how to prevent it. If you have a model, you know if it fails, no problem, your money management takes care of you. You can still trade the next trade when it forms, and you're not afraid because these things work more often than they fail.

Then, go to your daily chart and look for areas of interest and key levels (which I shared on the charts). Focus on where the market is gravitating towards.

*   By doing this, you give yourself an advantage by following a higher time frame bias and not being scared, second-guessing, or going against it.

It trades to inefficiency here, drops, and has a small rally.

*   What's it rallying up into? Inefficiency to drop.
*   What's it rallying up into here? Inefficiency to drop.
*   Inefficiency here? What does it do after rallies? Because of efficiency.
*   This one here? What does it do? Drop.

These highs are too clean; rallies take the liquidity there, then drop.

*   When you're in a sell program (bearish), you expect prices to deliver lower. It will only rally to do one of two things:
    *   Go into inefficiencies (fair value gaps above price).
    *   Run out of short-term highs.

That's it, folks. That's all these things do. The algorithm is coded to do just that.

*   It's not looking for animal patterns or supply and demand zones.
*   It's doing what I just said all the time, every day, week, month, year.
*   It's never going to stop doing that.

Once it does that, it will continuously reprice to what? There's a level down here. What's this level? That's that low; we're expecting it to reprice to down there.

## **Euro/Dollar Analysis: 15-Minute Chart and Liquidity Pools**

Here’s the Euro/Dollar 15-minute chart zoomed in. When watching others' analysis, and you may be doing this in your charts too, if I show you this chart like this, a new trader might see this as support and want to buy it. I would not be buying that.

*   When doing your analysis, dress your charts correctly.
*   Have your levels so you're not looking at the chart with a skewed perspective (i.e., "it's too low now").

When I show the chart like this, you can see where I'm showing it: daily sell-side liquidity pool. The movement below those lows is what we're expecting on the daily chart.

*   If you don't have that on your chart while watching the price, you're clueless about what it's gravitating towards and will be influenced by every small price fluctuation.

You have to dress your charts properly, with your higher time frame key levels. You can't trade effectively if using ultra-small time frames (5, 4, 3, 2, 1 minute) zoomed in with only a handful of candlesticks.

*   You'll get overly emotional when you need not be.
*   Have the right things on your chart.

## **S&P Daily Chart Analysis: Key Levels and Expectations**

Here we are on the S&P daily chart. Pause the video and note anything you observe. For those impatient, here's what we're focusing on: These are my key levels.

*   We'll zoom in on the shaded area, but be mindful that I took your attention to these relative equal highs earlier in February.
*   We were going to trade to that, and we did.

I said we were in this range and needed to leave it to be more confident about where it's going. Why did I know we'd consolidate?

*   We had two volume imbalances here.
*   We had already taken the buy-side here.
*   We had to submit to the expectation of a higher dollar, making this likely to go lower.

## **Zooming In: Key Levels and Market Behavior**

Zooming in here are those key levels. Go through your chart and figure out what these are on your own time frame.

*   You can take these as journal notes, but it's important to do this on your own charts.
*   The consequent encroachment of this wick is the 4023 and a half level.
*   The mean threshold of the bearish order block (should be a bearish order block, but now because we're below it, it will be viewed as a bearish order block).

**Key Insight:**

The old low and the consequent encroachment of this midpoint of this gap are key.

## **Precision Trading: The Fair Value Gap Anatomy**

We have this small gap down here prior to Friday's trading, unfilled or left open. On Friday, we delivered it right to it, the mean threshold (consequent encroachment) of the wick here, trades up into it, and then delivers down to that level. That is very precise.

Everything here will come back to, but I'll take your attention to something specific with that gap. Focus on that fair value gap. Do you see anything that stands out?

*   Algorithms and high-frequency trading algorithms will take that inefficiency and break it up into quadrants.

I'll show you how I could talk about Thursday's trading when the GDP number came out and how I knew where it would go.

*   I was looking at this gap. This is the anatomy of the fair value gap at the entire range.
*   Put it in quarters, so there's a quadrant from the highest to here, midpoint, lower third, low.

If we take those levels and add them to the hourly chart, watching the live stream on Thursday morning, the fair value gap was at the low end of what?

*   The high upper quarter, midpoint, lower quarter low of that daily fair value.
*   That 60-minute fair value gap resides right at that lower quadrant.

I only want to see it trade up into that. I don't want to see it go above the halfway point because, if it does, it's probably not as bearish as I want it to be.

*   The best short positions will occur at the midpoint of that gap on the daily chart, which is that dashed line and the low.
*   It goes up to the upper quadrant, and it's the 60-minute fair value gap.

High-frequency trading algorithms are going to trade that right there, and the market drops lower. Couple this idea with what I've been teaching about how prices don't reach a specific level and fail, indicating exceedingly bearish or bullish conditions. I'll teach more about that this week.

*   I'll also teach you more about new week opening gaps in a specific lesson entirely by itself.

## **Multiple Time Frame Analysis and Smart Money Techniques**

On the fifth-minute time frame, you can see it here.

*   It runs up, hits that lower quadrant level (that fair value gap on the daily chart), and the premium 60-minute fair value gap, which doesn't look like a fair value gap now when we look at it on a 15-minute chart.
*   It's important to move from the top down, higher time frame, lower time frame.

Here is that high, higher high formed between these two time periods (vertical lines). The S&P made higher highs there into the area I was drawing your attention to, and it's the lower quadrant on that daily fair value gap.

*   At the same time, the dollar index was unwilling to do what? Make a lower low.

That's SMT (Smart Money Technique) – USDX (Dollar Index) SMT. It should have made a lower low, but it didn't.

*   When it does these things, that's what's flashing like a beacon, saying, "Okay, smart money is going to go short here."
*   What's it going to aim for? Sell-side liquidity.

Why? Because it took the buy stops above here.

*   If they're going to sell shorts to buy stops here, what are they going to look for to get out? Sell stops residing right below there.
*   Where does the market go? Right there.
*   Then what does it do? Right back up to the fair value gap on the daily chart, bounces there, hits the new week opening gap.

## **Divergences and Range Completion**

On a five-minute chart:

*   Beautiful higher high into a level I was calling.
*   There's the SMT divergence telling you it's going to drop.

Back to our chart with all the details. We're going to use these levels here now.

*   On the hourly chart, with all the pertinent old low consequent encroachment with the wick order block mean threshold, we break down through it.
*   There's that hourly gap, and here's that 4023.5 level.

This is where people get lost in the videos. That's why you have to watch and write down notes. The consequent encroachment of the daily chart wick is what this is here.

*   The market goes back up to it here, then prices down to that old order block and low on the daily chart, which is 3948.75.

Beautiful, deliberate price action this week. On the hourly chart, you can see how we went from the fair value gap (that was also the daily fair value gap lower quadrant), and once it hit it, repriced lower right back to the 4023.5 level (wick consequent encroachment).

*   Consolidation looks like a bull fight to retail traders, then rolls on down to a level that completes the sell program for near term on a Friday.

With that divergence down here, the market trades up higher here, also in that fair value gap higher into this high here.

*   The NASDAQ was giving the S&P divergence.
*   It did not make a higher high when the Dow did when the S&P went into our objective.

That is smart money going short, and the market does, in fact, reprice lower.

## **Consequent Encrouchment: Algorithm and Support**

When we filled that gap on the daily chart here, we made the lower low in the S&P.

*   We did not make the lower low in Dow while we made the lower low in NASDAQ.
*   We are done for the daily range. It's going to reprice, go where? The high-side liquidity that's here.
*   We ran above it here, retraced a fair value gap, and rallied again (constant encroachment of the gap here).

Notice it didn't just go up to this low here where support broken turns resistance.

*   No, it digs up to an algorithm reference point, which is the consequent encroachment of this gap.

# **Morning Market Analysis and Trading Experiment**

## **Introduction and Technical Difficulties**

*   **Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37ozsUreR0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37ozsUreR0)
*   The speaker begins by greeting the audience and confirming audio latency.
*   He mentions an ongoing **OBS (Open Broadcaster Software)** issue where incorrect scene settings previously caused audio loss during chart transitions.
    *   To prevent this, he will be using only one scene with a verified audio input capture.
*   Audio Quality: The speaker acknowledges that the audio quality might be subpar due to the use of the internal microphone.
    *   He explains that his preferred headset, despite being a high-end model, has been unreliable.
    *   He plans to purchase a better microphone in the future.

## **Baseline Measurement Experiment: Understanding Drawdown**

*   The speaker announces that today's session will involve the first of three **"Baseline Measurements"** designed for student learning this year.
    *   These measurements aim to assess the student's ability to capture, regain, and mitigate drawdown.
*   He emphasizes the importance of understanding how to recapture or mitigate drawdown, especially as a trader.
*   The speaker prepares to type out an explanation to avoid misinterpretations and out-of-context sound bites.
    *   The goal is to allow students to determine their growth over time.
*   The core idea is to simulate a laboratory experiment where students are placed in a drawdown situation to learn how to correct it.
    *   Unlike traditional teaching methods that focus on chasing money and entering trades, this approach emphasizes learning from mistakes.
*   The speaker clarifies that he does not encourage trading with live funds, due to the non-licensed financial advisor status and taxation laws.
    *   All teachings are based on paper trading or demo trading to remove the financial risk and psychological pressure.

## **Emphasis on Paper Trading and Funded Accounts**

*   He cautions against measuring skill sets too early, suggesting that students are likely to fail this week's experiment, given upcoming market events.
    *   He purposefully chose this week to emulate the pressure traders face when rushing into live trading without proper preparation, such as attempting to pass a funded account challenge.
*   He stresses the importance of having a financial cushion (two years of living expenses) before trading with real money, to avoid the trap of needing to trade for a living prematurely.
*   He advocates for a gradual and responsible approach to trading.
*   Paper Trading Accounts: Students are encouraged to use a paper trading account due to their limited experience.
    *   He references a previous Twitter poll about funded accounts, where most participants expressed interest in lower-tier accounts due to their affordability.
*   Even if students start with lower-tier funded accounts, they should aim to graduate to the highest tier and potentially manage multiple accounts.
*   The speaker notes that while he has no personal experience with funded accounts, his son is about to explore them.
*   Experiment Setup: He cites a $150,000 max loss threshold of a popular funded account companies as inspiration for this experiment.
    *   The **"laboratory experiment"** involves creating a paper trading account on TradingView with $150,000 and intentionally putting it into a drawdown situation.

## **Live Market Analysis and Opening Observations**

*   The speaker transitions to observing live price action as the market opens at 9:30 AM.
*   He mentions a new week opening gap principle that he will explain in a YouTube video.
*   He observes the dollar index, emphasizing that he can now confidently toggle through charts in OBS without losing audio.
*   He debunks claims that he doesn't use live data, confirming that the data feed is real-time with only a slight delay.
*   He sets up a five-minute chart for ES (E-mini S&P 500 futures contract), referring to it by this label throughout the session.
*   He advises against rushing into trades, given the range expansion from the previous day and the upcoming Fed chairman's testimony.
*   He analyzes why the price might move back down into the new week opening gap.
*   Dollar Index: He monitors the dollar index for signs of support or resistance, correlating its movements with ES.
*   He stresses that his analysis is for educational purposes and not a recommendation to buy or sell.
*   He reiterates that trading live funds while learning exposes one to taxation and monetary losses.
*   He's watching to see if down closed candles will support price movement up to 4077.

## **Chart Setup and Technical Observations**

*   He displays the U.S. cash CFD (Contract for Difference) on the right-hand side (not available for trading in the U.S.) and the March ES contract on the left.
*   He compares the relationship between the lows on the two charts.
*   He explains that his initial assessment is that price will aim for the next new week opening gap around 4077.
*   He asserts that he relies on price action itself, rather than ladders, depth of market data, trend lines, or magnitude data.
*   He then drops to a one-minute chart.
*   He demonstrates how to add charts to the bottom of the TradingView interface, including adding the Dixie (Dollar Index) chart.
*   He monitors the dollar index to see if it will take out its sell-side liquidity, allowing ES to expand to the buy-side.
*   He clarifies that he's not giving buy recommendations and the audience should not use their paper trading account yet.
*   He calls Mass Diagnostics a little bit of a wild card.

## **Market Relationships and Future Trading**

*   He notes that ES has not made a lower low, while NASDAQ has, indicating relative strength in ES.
*   He explains that everything moves to the upside if ES is relatively stronger than the dollar Index.
*   He addresses questions about whether he will trade in front of the audience this year, confirming that he will.
    *   He will demonstrate entering, pyramiding, and hitting targets, but emphasizes that his primary focus is teaching.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, adhering to all the specified guidelines.

# **Market Analysis and Trading Observations**

## **December Special and Candle Analysis**

*   The speaker announces a special share for December, responding to audience requests.
*   He highlights the consecutive closeness of the candles, noting they are "damn close" and equivalent to a five-minute down close candle. This will be explained later.
*   He observes price movement from the opening of the candle, drawing it out in time, into another discount array.
*   **Volume Balance:** He defines a volume balance as a separation of any candle or candles (more than two is possible) where there is no overlapping of the bodies.
    *   Bodies must overlap or at least meet. If they don't, it indicates a volume imbalance.
    *   It's more likely to see price return to that level.
    *   Ideally, he prefers to see a body laid across that level, but in a fast market, it's not necessary.

## **Dollar Index and Intraday Trading Strategy**

*   The **Dollar Index** is still finding difficulty getting below its intraday low.
*   There hasn't been significant price movement.
*   He outlines how to approach trading on a day like today, aiming to define what to look for.
*   **Trading Strategy:** Wait for the first 30 minutes and then trade inside the 10 o'clock hour.
*   **Macro Analysis:** Study what the first macro does between 9:50 and 10:10.
    *   A macro is algorithmic and will cause the market to run for liquidity or inefficiency.
    *   If the market hasn't done much, this window can provide insight into what it will likely do leading into the lunch hour (11:00).

## **Price Levels and Market Speed**

*   Referencing a specific low and high on the chart, he mentions:
    *   He wants to see if the price has the willingness to reach a specific level (one standard deviation from the low to the high).
    *   He wants to see the price gravitate toward that level.
    *   The speed at which the price moves toward this level, and how it trades at this level, will indicate how it will trade in a "newly token death" (rest of the above price).

## **Impulse Control and Trading Premise**

*   One of the hardest things for a trader is to contend with the impulse to "do something."
*   He stresses the importance of knowing *what* you are trying to speculate on.
*   You need a clear, strongly-rooted premise for why price should even do anything.
*   Currently, the only justification is that the market traded down into a fair value gap on a five-minute chart.
    *   They traded down to it, but the behavior at the highs is important.
*   Is the market showing a willingness to aggressively expand after taking out the short-term high (buy stops)? Not yet.
*   Is it showing a willingness to reject that high (turtle soup/false breakout) and collapse below the fair value gap? Not yet.

## **Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) and Self-Control**

*   He acknowledges it's difficult to convey the feeling of the impulse to do something and the feeling of being cheated from a move, especially in the first run of the morning.
*   This feeling is **Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)**.
*   The goal this year is to help traders gain better control of themselves and their impulses.

## **Market Symmetry and Opening Range**

*   He's watching if price is making another attempt at a higher high, while observing the **Dollar Index**.
*   The **Dollar Index** should be showing lower prices if ES is moving higher.
*   If ES is spreading its wings higher, the Dollar Index should be indicating "risk on" by posting lower prices.
*   Currently, the **Dollar Index** is stagnant, indicating a lethargic opening range.
*   **Opening Range:** The first 30 minutes of trading from 9:30 to 10:00. The opening range is *always* the opening range.
*   Where they open in that opening range is what will be discussed.

## **Electronic Trading Hours and Gap Analysis**

*   They are currently showing electronic trading hours (ETH).
*   You can see electronic trading hours being used by looking at a little tab down below.
*   During the first few minutes at the opening bell (9:30), it's important to have a reference of where they last closed.
*   On Friday, they closed the day session at a certain point, then opened up higher, rallying. They have already shown they have ran the buy side, but it has not been confirmed.
*   The **Dollar Index** has not made a lower low as would be expected, indicating a likely pullback into the opening range gap.
*   **Opening Range Gap:** The difference between the opening price (9:30 opening bell) and where they closed. This gap is defined by this range.
*   There are also: New day opening gaps and new week opening gaps, which are different from this opening range.
*   **New Day Opening Gap:** The difference between the closing price at 5 pm and the opening price is 6 pm.
*   **New Week Opening Gap:** The difference between last Friday's closing price and Sunday's first opening price.
*   He teaches three specific gaps.
*   He reverts to electronic trading hours and adds that to the chart.
*   He notes the set up might not be pretty but its working for him, and that you can follow the setup in delay if you dont have real time charts.

## **Patience and Trust in the Process**

*   There's nothing indicating a trade; no trade has been formed by now.
*   He addresses common questions about how to trust the process and avoid fearing missing a move.
*   He re-iterates that the whole point of the year with his students is to get to real time and real-time data.
*   There's no impending doom, no emergency, and no rush to get in and do something *right now*.
*   He stresses trust that the things being taught repeat.
*   Even if there's a nice, clean move (which hasn't been seen yet), it doesn't matter if you didn't participate.
*   That trade is just one of *many* that will form over a career as a speculator or student.
*   There will be lots of movements in the price action that you don't participate in.
*   No trader is in *every* move. You have to sleep, eat, and spend time with family. You may also get ill.

## **Current Market Observations and Dollar Index Correlation**

*   He is watching if the market respects the current level and presses down into the sell-side.
*   The **Dollar Index** looks a little softer here.
*   If the dollar were going to go lower, it would be doing it here *now*.
*   **Sell Side:** Refers to cell stops resting below an old low (equal lows).

## **Patience and Live Account Trading**

*   They've been trading for 22 minutes and not much has happened.
*   You learn to take reading for months, not just one week, before trying to trade with a small live account.
*   The main thing you will learn by doing this is to be fearful of losing and becoming emotionally attached to the outcome.
*   Trading with a live account, even with a small amount, does this *before* you know how to read the marketplace.
*   That is the "perfect recipe" to make you afraid of trading and afraid of the next setup.
*   When you take a losing trade, you have not properly conditioned yourself or desensitized yourself to the outcome.
*   Trading with live money when you don't have trade consistently prepares your mind to be fearful of the outcome.
*   The number one task as a trader is to overcome that fear.
*   Study price action to the point where it is boring and condition yourself to know what it's like in times where it's not likely to run off and do a big move (so you don't feel regretful).

## **Market Symmetry and Momentum**

*   He's watching how they react if price trades below the low for the sell-side on the dollar.
*   He is watching how they take the recent high, or if they keep that high in place from a market symmetry stance.
*   If they take the low out, then everything is balanced.
*   The market would have to really make a move of serious momentum to get things moving this morning. Otherwise, it's probably going to trade less efficiently.

## **Economic Calendar and Market Influences**

*   Hypothetically referring to the economic calendar, he mentions that the Fed chairman is testifying tomorrow morning and on Wednesday morning.
*   Because of this, many people are holding back and waiting to see how things unfold over the next two days.
*   Gamblers and high-energy/caffeine junkies are always trying to do something in the marketplace.
*   Those are the ones who want to gamble because they don't know the influence of what the market will do.
*   These same people usually have bad performance on those days, which is often publicly documented.
*   Individuals interested in learning how to control themselves and be measured in their reach into risk don't rush in these environments. They sit back and wait.
*   It's the first mouse that gets clipped by the mousetrap, and the second mouse that gets the cheese.

## **High Resistance Liquidity Runs**

*   You will have plenty of time over the month, the week, and the year to see amazing price runs.
*   There are certain price runs that he is not personally interested in, and you can't appreciate that if he just says he's looking for low resistance liquidity runs.
*   The audience is learning what it's like to be in high resistance environments.
*   He could only do live streams in low resistance conditions where the market would run right off into targets with barely any drawdown, but you learn nothing from that.
*   He notes he sees several people who don't watch everything he does so they don't know he has mentioned what the characteristics are that leads to a high resistance liquidity run condition.
*   In simple terms, you learn to participate in high resistance conditions only to get an appreciation for what it's like when you're not in them. And when you are in a low resistance condition.
*   **High Resistance Liquidity Runs:** where the market is moving, and can go to targets, he opts out of these.
*   He wants to participate in situations when the market just quickly wants to run from one pool of liquidity to the next (or one premium array to a discount array opposing it) and does it efficiently and quickly without messing around.
*   What you're seeing now is *all* high resistance liquidity conditions.
*   **In high resistance liquidity run conditions, the market is in no hurry to get to an opposing discount or premium array.**
*   Liquidity or inefficiency is encapsulated by that idea.
*   In a low resistance liquidity run, the market is in a *hurry* to get where it wants to go.
*   He trains his students to look for this in price action.
*   It helps filter out the environments that most likely will give you choppy days where most traders get beat up.
*   On social media, live streamers, and Twitter/Discord rings, invariably on the days that he is in low resitance conditions most are beat up.

I hope this response is helpful! I have tried my best to adhere to all instructions and capture every nuance of the original text.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, adhering to all the specified guidelines.

# **Market Analysis: High Resistance Trading and Partial Profit Taking**

## **High Resistance Market Conditions and Selective Trading**

*   The speaker emphasizes the **high resistance** nature of the current market, advocating for a reserved and selective approach to trading.
*   He contrasts this with social media narratives where traders often report poor performance ("chopped up," "beat up") due to the difficult market conditions.
*   He clarifies that the market itself isn't "crappy," but rather operating under high resistance, which requires specific training to recognize and navigate.

## **Understanding High Resistance: Example and Sell-Side Liquidity**

*   He provides an example of **high resistance** in the current market, referencing a trade down to a five-minute fair value gap.
*   This trade enters into **sell-side liquidity**, specifically sell stops placed below a recent low.
*   **Retail traders** often place their stop losses just below these lows out of fear, following conventional advice to "put your stop loss to break even."

## **Stop Loss Strategy: Partial Profits and Risk Management**

*   The speaker diverges from conventional stop-loss strategies.
*   Instead, he prioritizes **partial profit-taking** and allows the market to reach the first partial target before moving the stop.
*   He relies on **partials** to do most of the heavy lifting in risk management, rather than prematurely moving the stop loss.
*   His teaching style is designed to buffer new traders.
*   It gives them a cushion, so their experience can dictate when to move stop losses and reduce risk.
*   It also provides insights into when it's appropriate to move to break even.
*   He stresses that the stop loss is "paid to do a job" of removing risk, and getting stopped out indicates a "human error" or "misguided judgment" on that particular transaction.
*   Getting stopped out doesn't mean a flawed logic or the trader being inherently bad. It is simply the cost of doing business.

## **The Value of Partial Profit-Taking**

*   The speaker highlights the importance of taking partial profits when the market presents an opportunity.
*   He counters the argument that taking partials is "stupidest thing in the world," by stating that you don't know if your model and your execution is going to yield a profitable exit.
*   Many people in the industry with good-sized followings, he mentions, constantly harp on the fact that taking partials is the stupidest thing in the world.
*   He argues that if traders are only accepting their final target as a Terminus with an All or Nothing mindset, that it's foolish.
*   The speaker mentions that he would never encourage people to hold for their full target or nothing at all.
*   Partial profit allows traders to secure gains and reduce risk, and get paid.
*   A partial has never, ever, ever failed in making money. It has a 100 strike rate.
*   He uses an analogy of martial arts belts, with each partial taken representing advancement in skill and experience, but each trade has to start back at white belt level again.
    *   He references western culture and its need for rewards and treating yourself.

## **Psychology of Trading: Greed, Conviction, and Realistic Expectations**

*   The speaker addresses the mindset of traders, especially regarding greed and the need to be "right."
*   He emphasizes that being a good trader is about managing risk, sticking to rules, and securing profits when available, rather than achieving perfect trades that hit targets without any partials.
*   The partial offers itself when the market has presented an opportunity for you to take something off and get paid for the time, emotion, energy, and mental equity stressing and when the market has presented an opportunity for you to take something off and get paid.
*   He uses a work analogy to mention that if an illness takes you out part way through the week, you would still want to get paid for the portion you did complete.
*   Those who reject partials are often in denial about their results, experiencing more losses due to missed targets and premature stop-outs.
*   He emphasizes that being in a mindset of "I have to be right", you are setting yourself up for failure. Instead, you need to believe you are a good trader if you manage risk and you stick to rules.
*   Targets are just the best case scenario.

## **Market Conditions and Order Blocks**

*   When ES drops below equal lows that trigger cell stops, its also dropping into an opening range gap.
*   He recalls his previous tape reading two weeks back.

## **Current Market Analysis: Dollar Index Correlation and Key Levels**

*   The speaker discusses the **correlation** between the **Dollar Index** and the **ES** (E-mini S&P 500 futures contract).
*   He notes that a weaker dollar should support higher prices in ES, potentially leading to a move toward the next **new week opening gap** around 4077.
*   He identifies key levels for partial profit-taking before reaching that gap, based on Fibonacci levels.
*   He mentions that with cell stops being hit, it is also trading into the opening range gap.
*   He states the differences between where we traded and closed on Friday.

## **Real-Time Observation and Market Dynamics**

*   He emphasizes the importance of observing price action in **real-time** to understand market dynamics.
*   He contrasts this with static charts or market replay, which offer the benefit of hindsight.
*   He draws attention to specific price movements and explains their significance based on the relationship between the **Dollar Index** and **ES**.
*   The main threshold in this level is if there's price being supported in the mid-point of the down closed candle.
*   He mentions the fair value gap and the short-term high here.
*   He mentions the differences of a price run when a trade goes to a fair value gap and down into the opening range.

## **Presence of Family**

*   Speaker jokes about viewers thinking his son isn't present during the stream and confirms his son is actually standing next to him.

I hope this is helpful!


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, adhering to all the specified guidelines.

# **Market Analysis: Displacement, Dollar Index Correlation, and Paper Trading Assignment**

## **Short-Term Displacement and the Dollar Index**

*   The speaker was observing the **short-term displacement** and the potential expansion of the "bicep" (likely referring to a price pattern).
*   The focus then shifted to the **Dollar Index**, which became a focal point.
*   The key question was: Did the **Dollar Index** want to move below its old low (Ola)?
    *   If so, the speaker sought a willingness to move through that low and a lack of interest in returning above it.
    *   A drive down would increase confidence in the **new week opening gap** as a draw on liquidity.

## **Trading Strategy: Speculation vs. Order Blocks**

*   The speaker questions whether to simply buy and hold, targeting a trade to the new week opening gap.
*   He contrasts this approach with that of a seasoned **speculator**.
*   He emphasizes that **order blocks** (down-closed candles) are *supposed* to support price.
    *   However, not every down-closed candle qualifies as an order block.
    *   If price trades down into an order block, the speaker looks for it *not* to trade below the **mean threshold** (midpoint of the candle's range).
    *   If price rallies after touching this level and then retraces to touch it again, this strengthens the order block's validity.

## **New Week Opening Gap Target and Partial Profits**

*   The speaker noted during live trading that the price should expand higher, gravitating towards the **new week opening gap**, citing the **Dollar Index** movement as the reason.
*   The high of that candle precisely hit the 4077 level.
*   The speaker advocates for watching and observing whether the price gravitates to the **consequent encroachment** (midpoint) between the low of the new week opening gap and the high.
*   He suggests taking off **80%** of the trade at this level as a **partial profit**.
*   After taking the **partial**, the stop loss can be moved to break even or better.
    *   Ideally, the stop should be just below the midpoint of the range of price action (equilibrium).
    *   This leaves **20%** of the position remaining.

## **Emphasis on Practical Knowledge and Real-World Application**

*   The speaker believes that the outlined process might bore some listeners who are impatient and desire quick results.
*   He stresses that in the 1990s, he would have greatly valued someone outlining the specific elements he aims for in price action.
*   This includes:
    *   What he trusts to know will continuously drive price to a specific level.
    *   The factors he considers.
    *   What he does *not* want to see in price action.
*   He notes that everything supporting his ideas is internal to price action, not based on indicators.

## **Market Analysis: NASDAQ, Dow, and Fair Value Gaps**

*   The speaker quickly reviews the lows in the **NASDAQ**, noting the 9:30 AM low.
*   He compares this to the **Dow (YM)**, which he uses for short-term trading (ST).
*   He observes a **higher low** on the **Dow** and **ES**, while the **ES** formed a **lower low**.
*   This occurs as price trades into a **fair value gap**.
*   The speaker emphasizes that this was discussed in **real time**.
*   He wanted to see the fair value gap act as an indicator, even after buy-side liquidity had been taken out.

## **Market Conditions and Economic Calendar: Powell's Testimony**

*   He notes that a **slow market** is predisposed to adversities due to the economic calendar.
*   Specifically, Federal Reserve Chairman Powell is scheduled to speak on Tuesday morning and Wednesday.
*   This causes many traders to hold back from putting money at risk, leading to smaller price ranges and fluctuations.
*   In this environment, it's important to be nimble and avoid anticipating large moves.
*   Larger moves are more likely to occur tomorrow (Tuesday) during Powell's testimony and on Wednesday.
*   He anticipates increased volatility around 10:00 AM on Tuesday and during the afternoon session on Wednesday.
*   For the remainder of today (Monday), he expects a similar small range movement.
*   He mentions that he will share his thoughts on Twitter about potential market movements. He also states that he will not do a live session in the last hour.

## **Paper Trading Assignment: Baseline Measurement**

*   The speaker assigns a **paper trading** exercise to help traders understand their current level of understanding and learning.
*   The assignment involves starting with a **$150,000 paper trading account** and attempting to reduce it by **$3,000** today (aiming for a balance of around $147,000).
*   The challenge is to then bring the account back to **$150,000 before Friday's close.**
*   Crucially, the account balance cannot drop below **$144,000**.
*   If the $144,000 level is breached, the assignment is considered a failure.
*   The purpose is to establish a **baseline measurement** of trading skill at the beginning of the year.
*   The same exercise will be repeated halfway through the year (before November, when the mentorship program ends).
*   The goal is to measure improvement over time.
*   The speaker stresses that failure is acceptable and should be embraced as a learning opportunity.
*   The current week is intentionally chosen because it is representative of challenging real-world trading conditions.
*   Traders will likely feel the urge to chase big moves and be influenced by commentary about the Fed Chairman's statements.
*   However, the speaker cautions that volatile days often lead to the biggest losses.
*   This assignment addresses questions about recovering from drawdowns, overcoming the fear of losing, and navigating difficult market conditions.
*   The speaker is teaching how to navigate these issues, but traders need to experience them firsthand in the paper trading account.

## **The Mindset of Correcting Drawdown**

*   He emphasizes that it is crucial to have the right mindset for correcting drawdowns.
*   The goal is *not* to immediately recover losses. The speaker is assigning this paper trade for the whole week.
*   Rather, the focus should be on steady improvement and consistent application of trading principles.
*   Traders should not feel embarrassed or ashamed if they make mistakes or experience losses.
*   Every trader experiences losses and makes mistakes.
*   Even the speaker, who developed these concepts, sometimes tries to "finesse" his own rules and ends up being humbled by the market.

## **Human Frailty and Trading Education**

*   There is no perfect trader or trading system.
*   The inherent frailty of human nature will inevitably lead to substandard results.
*   Traders must accept their fallibility and embrace mistakes as part of the learning process.
*   It's crucial to approach trading education with a new resolve, allowing yourself to be fallible and make mistakes.
*    You will likely blow it, hurt yourself, and do dumb things.
*   You are going to look at the market and expect it to go higher and it won't, it goes lower, and you didn't participate in them.
*   How do you avoid regretting that or chasing it, knowing that the next moves will come?

## **Independent Thinking and Market Observation**

*   The speaker notes that many traders on social media are chasing gurus and waiting for breadcrumbs of information.
*   He encourages independent thinking and discourages blind following.
*   He has great respect for other live streamers who demonstrate successful trading, but he doesn't aim to replicate that approach.
*   He emphasizes that it's okay to watch other traders (even while being an independent thinker).
*   He observes how other traders react to their own decisions, regardless of their methodology or profitability.
*   This allows him to build lessons for his audience based on observed behavior.
*   He notes that inexperienced traders often want to impose their expectations on the market, which is a flawed approach.
*   The correct approach involves understanding what is likely to occur and then looking for evidence to support that idea, even if it's uncomfortable.
*   You have to submit the amount of time, and time being 10:30 now, it hit our new week opening gap.

## **Current Market Conditions and SMT Divergence**

*   At 10:30 AM, price hit the new week opening gap.
*   Price traded down into the opening range gap, described as tangerine (orange), and into a fair value gap.
*   This occurred while clearing relative equal lows.
*   At the same time, the Dow was not willing to make a comparable lower low.
*   This creates a **SMT (Smart Money Technique) divergence**, which suggests accumulation of longs.
*   However, the SMT divergence cannot be taken in isolation.
*   Traders must also weigh risk-on/risk-off factors, which act as "rocket fuel" behind trades.

## **Dollar Index Correlation and Efficient Delivery**

*   When going long on ES or NASDAQ, it's desirable to see the **Dollar Index** going lower.
*   A rallying **Dollar Index** is not supportive.
*   While the Dollar Index can consolidate, it will likely lead to quick corrections in the index futures later.
*   The **Dollar Index** serves as a useful tool for gauging whether a trade will be delivered efficiently and quickly to its target.
*   If the **Dollar Index** is not supportive (i.e., moving in the opposite direction), the trade is less likely to be efficient.
*   Looking at the entire run up to the fair value gap, the **Dollar Index** should have been lower.
*   The speaker observes that the **Dollar Index** is now coming off its lows.
*   Retail traders might interpret this as broken support now acting as resistance.
*   However, the speaker considers this view too myopic.
*   He anticipates a potential move up to the **consequent encroachment** on the Dollar Index, followed by a failed lower low and some consolidation going into lunch.
*   He believes there won't be a lot of movement today due to expectations surrounding Fed Chair Powell's testimony tomorrow.

## **Weekly Calendar and Market Range**

*   The speaker emphasizes the importance of reviewing the weekly economic calendar on weekends.
*   Traders should identify major news events (high and medium impact) and note when the Fed Chair is speaking.
*   These events will influence how the weekly and daily ranges are formed.
*   They can determine whether price movements are one-sided or slow and high resistance.
*   The current market is characterized as **high resistance**, even though it performed as expected.
*   It takes a lot of time to reach targets in this environment.

## **Impatience and Quick Profits**

*   The speaker recognizes that new traders often seek quick price moves that immediately reach their targets, minimizing risk and holding time.
*   He understands this desire, as he was similarly impatient early in his trading career.
*   He analyzed these situations and conditions because, as a young man, he was impatient.
*   He wanted to be in trades that ran away in his favor, got to his targets quickly and he got out of the trade.
*   He did this so he didn't have to have any risk and so he had to recuperate, because it was very stressful for him.
*   He was running a thousand scenarios in his mind - what if it hits my stop, what if it doesn't go to my target, what happens if it just sits here and it doesn't move tomorrow night?
*   This was because he was holding trades overnight as a commodity Trader so it was a very daunting task for him because it doesn't fit his personality.
*   He makes decisions really quick and you might not feel that way as a person or have that personality or that characteristic as a person.
*   You might be a little bit more slower in terms of making your decisions and this trade may be perfect for you.
*   You might look at the same this is exactly what I'm looking for, great that's wonderful.
*   He is not trying to say that you can't find trades in high resistance liquidity run signatures you can, he just doesn't like them because he wants to be in trades that tear.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, adhering to all the specified guidelines.

# **Trading Psychology, Market Dynamics, and Paper Trading Assignment: A Deep Dive**

## **The Allure of Quick Profits and Immediate Feedback**

*   The speaker expresses his preference for trades that:
    *   Take off right from his entry.
    *   Run directly to his partials.
    *   Hit his target quickly.
*   He describes this type of trading as "wham bam thank you man."
*   He enjoys the **quick, sudden, and immediate feedback** because:
    *   It makes it exciting.
    *   It makes it fun.
    *   It's like a treasure hunt.
*   These opportunities occur daily and are not hidden.
    *   They have been outlined this morning.

## **Low Resistance vs. High Resistance Liquidity Runs**

*   The speaker contrasts his preferred style with trading scenarios characterized by high resistance.
*   **Low resistance** means there is nothing impeding speed.
*   The current market is not exhibiting this characteristic due to:
    *   The economic calendar.
    *   Upcoming testimonies by the Fed Chairman on Tuesday and Wednesday.
    *   The fact that it is the first day of the week.
    *   A lack of overall excitement.
*   Therefore, traders must allow the market to seek **fair value.**

### **Fair Value: Gaps and Institutional Influence**

*   **Fair Value Gaps** are a form of fair value.
*   However, larger traders (funds with billions of dollars) are induced to levels that inspire new order flow.
*   This new order flow serves to remove or replace liquidity, often in the form of the **new week opening gap.**
    *   He started teaching this concept a couple of weeks ago in February.

### **Understanding Range Quadrants**

*   The speaker divides a range into **four quadrants**:
    *   High
    *   Low
    *   Midpoint
    *   Midpoint between high/low.
*   The range is NOT based on "quarters theory."
*   Traders should study what the speaker is doing, compare it to what they think it is, and realize it is completely different.

## **Defining Low Resistance Liquidity Runs**

*   The speaker elaborates on what a low resistance liquidity run *looks like*.
*   High resistance stems from fair value gaps and order blocks.
    *   While price *did* gravitate to the expected level, that is not the full picture.
*   The resistance factor in his definition refers to **resistance in speed**.
*   When he annotates his trades looking for "speed and distance," he is indicating a low resistance price run.

### **High Resistance: Price Delivery and Time**

*   In a **high resistance liquidity run**:
    *   Price still gravitates to the intended target.
    *   However, the path is characterized by retracements, consolidation, and sideways movement.
*   This is not due to specific levels acting as resistance, but rather **resistance in the scope of price speed delivery**.
*   The key factor is **delivery speed**.

### **Low Resistance: Efficient and Quick Movement**

*   If the level of speed is present in the trade, then it's a low resistance scenario.
*   **Resistance is low in terms of speed**.
*   Nothing is limiting the movement from one point to another in terms of time.
*   In contrast, a low resistance liquidity run would involve reaching the target in two or three candles (compared to many).

## **Trading Preferences: Low vs. High Resistance**

*   It's possible to trade profitably in **high resistance liquidity runs**, but the speaker prefers not to because they are boring to him.
*   He prefers to look for trades like a word search or crossword puzzle.
*   He seeks quick, sudden moves with magnitude and speed.
*   This makes trading fun.

### **New Traders and Market Conditions**

*   New students might find the current market conditions tedious.
*   Watching the candles paint might feel like watching grass grow.
*   However, trading in low resistance liquidity runs is fast and exciting.
*   The speaker assures listeners that the market conditions *will* loosen up.
*   When this happens, traders will recognize a low resistance liquidity run by its speed.
    *   Price immediately wants to go somewhere.
    *   It doesn't waste time.
    *   Being on board is very fun.

### **Avoiding Brand Worship and Independent Thinking**

*   The speaker acknowledges that while profitable and delivering to targets, he's not arguing against high resistance runs, and doesn't want to discourage anyone who's comfortable with it.
*   He is concerned that some traders treat him like a brand and blindly imitate his preferences.
    *   This makes him uncomfortable.
    *   He doesn't want to be a celebrity.
*   He urges traders not to frame his personal trading preferences as their own.
*   He doesn't want to pressure anyone into a specific mode.
*   The speaker notes that he's dogmatic about price delivery.
*   If you trade in line with how he teaches how price is going to book even retail stuff will work.

## **Paper Trading Assignment: Establishing a Baseline**

*   The speaker transitions to the assignment, urging listeners to go to their paper trading accounts.
*   As of right now, your trading account should have **$150,000** in your paper trading account.
*   **DO NOT RESET** the account if you went over the threshold. It is fine, log it.
*   **DO NOT LOG** the trades that you use to draw the account down.

### **Phase 1: Intentional Drawdown**

*   The first part of the assignment is to intentionally draw down the account by **$3,000** to **$147,000**.
*   To achieve this, you must trade in the account.
*   Simply go in and select a commodity (e.g. gum, do ten contracts.)
*   Place the trade, and let the market move against you.
*   Let it move against you a couple of handles and close the trade.
*   Repeat this process today until the account reaches $147,000.

### **Addressing Objections**

*   The speaker addresses the potential objection that traders might simply want to set the account to $147,000 without trading.
*   The point is to *see* the numbers in the trade history, just like in real trading.
*   You must be accepting of the fact that drawdown is going to happen eventually.
*   The goal is to get comfortable with seeing it and not being afraid of it.

### **Phase 2: Recovery**

*   The second part of the assignment is to recuperate from the drawdown and bring the account back to $150,000.
*   The task must be completed by the end of the week.

## **Market Analysis: Dollar Index and ES**

*   He is back on the chart, outlining the market conditions.
*   The instructions are to create a pseudo here's your consequent encroachment and the next level will be here.
*   Now that the level has been hit, it is time to examine the Dollar Index.
*   "Does the Dollar have that lower low?"
    *   He had not looked yet.
*   The dollar **did not make that low**.
*   They went through the consequent encroachment as anticipated.
*   He expected a higher low.

### **Consolidation and Market Symmetry**

*   The speaker believes that the market will consolidate for the rest of the morning going into lunch.
*   This is based on the fact that the dollar has not made that higher high here in the ES with a lower low hasn't met a lower level.
*   In a perfectly symmetrical market, the dollar should be on a lower low, but it is not.
*   "We have a higher high in ES that should be met with a lower low in dollar, it's not."

### **Trade Management and Dollar Index Divergence**

*   The inability to make a lower low on dollar "would completely close my trade entirely. I wouldn't have anything else."
*   Earlier, he noted that at the 4077 level, there was potentially a partial taken, with 80% of the trade coming off.
*   This leaves 20% remaining.
*   Because the Dollar Index has failed to make that lower low, while they were long on the ES, the position would be closed entirely.
*   It is now 11:00 AM, and he would be comfortable taking the trade off here even if it went to the 4084 level.
    *   "I don't care and you want to be conditioned so that way you don't care either."

### **Trade Rationale and Consequent Encroachment**

*   Down close candle supports price rallies up with the dog going lower everything is on everything being equal.
*   Rather when we get to the 4077 level 80 of trade comes off why because it still could see weakness on dollar and you can trade their consequent person if it gets the constant encroachment with a higher low that's a green light for me to say okay I'm done.
*   If there wasn't the FED Chairmen speech tomorrow and Wednesday, he wouldn't take 80% off of here.
    *   He would take 50% off and another 25% here.
    *   This would leave a balance of 25% of the position that would have occurred here or down here down here.
*   This shows a lot of theory as to you know how I internalized price where I take partials why I subscribe to submitting to price a certain way what am I submitting to what am I evaluating throughout the process of price moving I'm I've walked you through it this morning.

## **Call to Action and Market Review**

*   If this was insightful, give the video a thumbs up.
    *   It is volunteer.
*   If the video was not insightful, a thumbs down is welcome, but he doesn't care.
*   Comment on Twitter with feedback.

### **US 500 vs. ES**

*   Quick look at the US 500 vs the ES trade.
*   Both charts show the same thing occurring.
*   "I wanted to toggle back to this I apologize it's a work in progress I'm sure I'll be better at this as we go further into the year but you can still see the same thing occurring I'll take two but where the tone the left chart is es Futures Contract that down close candle supporting price down first candle supporting price so you still see the same thing the same elements are there and then the delivery on the outside so."

### **CFDs and the New Week Opening Gap**

*   There are folks saying they do not see the new week opening gaps for the CFD, which is the US 500 or US-100 USM.
*   To refer to the cfd where price has the new leak opening gaps on the Futures Contract even if you're using it with delay data it doesn't matter when price is trading near those newly opening gaps or they're being utilized as a draw for liquidity where price was trading comparably in the es chart when it was trading at the newly opening Gap year that's how you would do it.

### **New Week Opening Gap Chart**

*   Looking at the New Week Opening Gap chart.
*   Notice how price is coming off that consequent encroachment.
*   Friday closing price regular trading hours and an opening price on Sunday.
*   Calibrate the US 500 with the Fridays closing price and opening price.

### **The Importance of Futures Data**

*   It is not going to be perfect.
*   He counsels everyone to try to get the data for U.S Futures even if you can't trade them.
*   The data itself is useful because you're you're going to be following the logic that I'm teaching you and the cfd is going to follow what the Futures Contract is doing the Futures Contract is not referring to the US 500 and trying to keep up with it it's that's not happening okay the cfd is trying to keep up with what this Market's doing so your data needs to be derived from This Not That of the US 500 or us-100 cfd.
*   "So if you're just trading the cfd and you're not ever referring to the actual Futures Contract prices you're playing with a you know you're trading blindfolded you don't you don't have all the details that you need especially if you're trying to be precise and detail or any so."
*   The session is going to close, and he hopes that everyone benefited from this morning.
*   Until next time, be safe.

# **Audio Check and Market Overview**

## **Introduction**

*   Video URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu0sQarBRrI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu0sQarBRrI)
*   The speaker begins with an audio check, expressing relief at finding the stream.
*   Acknowledges hurting themself, then confirms the audio is working.
*   **Disclaimer:** The speaker had the flu last week, and their voice is not fully recovered, especially after excessive talking the previous day. They will try to limit talking.

## **Economic Calendar and Fed Testimony**

*   **Focus:** The primary topic for today is the market situation, particularly considering the **economic calendar**.
*   **Key Event:** **Chairman Powell** will be testifying at **10:00 AM** both today and Wednesday.
*   **Warning:** Speculation this morning is strongly discouraged. The speaker emphasizes that no one, including themselves, possesses high-probability, low-risk insights when the **Federal Reserve (FED)** is involved.

### **The FED's Influence**

*   **Manual Intervention:** The FED's involvement introduces manual intervention, overriding typical market rules and analysis.
*   **Controlled Demolition:** It's described not as a lack of liquidity but as "absolutely controlled demolition."
*   **Advice to Students:** Students are advised to "sit on your hands and do nothing," accepting the uncertainty. There should be no bias.

### **Post-Testimony Analysis**

*   **Objective:** Observe the aftermath of the FED Chairman's testimony, specifically:
    *   **Liquidity** left in the market.
    *   **Inefficiency** left in the market.
*   **Market Reactions:** The market is expected to either:
    *   Rise for buy stops or reprice to a fair value gap above the price.
    *   Fall below recent lows for sell-side liquidity or to a fair value gap below the market price.

### **Understanding FED Actions**

*   **Clarification:** The FED chairman isn't directly "pushing price around". It's a series of manual interventions that can lead to unexpected level runs.
*   **Personal Experience:** The speaker notes past discomfort trading during these periods, even when correct.
*   **Key Point:** When the FED is involved, regular rules and models don't apply during that period.

### **Trading Strategy**

*   **Post-Testimony Trading:** After the testimony (about 15 minutes later), the chart's layout will inform decisions for the PM session.
*   **Morning Speculation:** Considered a "gamble" and attributing any success to skill would be foolish.
*   **Respect the Risk:** Acknowledge the inability to predict FED actions and communicate this uncertainty to students. It's "foolish" to believe you know what to do.

## **Honesty and Humility in Trading**

### **Admitting Uncertainty**

*   The speaker states, "There's no weakness in saying that I don't know it right now because it's the truth, and no one else does either."
*   They criticize those who pretend to have perfect systems for these scenarios.
*   The speaker prefers to step aside and allow the market to unfold.

### **Analogy**

*   **Gamblers' Sacrifice:** "Let the gamblers sacrifice themselves on the altar of chance."
*   **Non-Farm Payroll:** This situation is compared to the volatility of non-farm payroll week, highlighting a difficult week for traders.

### **Observational Approach**

*   Focus on observing in real-time, sharing noteworthy findings. Anything deemed uninformative will not be mentioned.
*   The PM session (1:30 PM - 4:00 PM New York local time) will be based on these observations.
*   "I'm not interested in pushing any buttons this morning, neither should you."

### **Importance of Observation**

*   **Foolish Action:** Dismissing the importance of watching the price action because you wouldn't be trading.
*   **Reasoning:** Understand market behavior when the FED intervenes.

## **Market Analysis and Annotations**

### **Current Market Movements**

*   **Dollar Index (DXY):** Moved up into a buy-side liquidity pool. Swept yesterday's high of 104.691.
*   **NASDAQ:** Swept its relative equal lows.

### **Annotation Exercise**

*   **Purpose:** To study the market without actively trading.
*   **Method:** Annotate the 5- and 15-minute charts with potential price targets, acting as if in "complete control" of the market.
*   **Targets:** Buy-side liquidity pools (untouched highs) and sell-side liquidity (recent lows).

### **Specific Annotations (NASDAQ Example)**

*   **Highs:** Annotate the high that hasn't been returned to in the 15-minute timeframe.
*   **Lows:** Annotate the recent lows, considering proximity and potential for movement.

### **Observational Focus**

*   **FED Influence:** Observe which levels the FED influences first.
*   **Learning:** Study the market's movement between annotated levels (e.g., from high to low or vice versa).
*   **Emphasis:** "It's not a matter of being right or wrong, it's not a matter of a trade setup."

### **Reading the Tape**

*   **Description:** Observing price action to understand the market's behavior.
*   **Experience:** "Experience chart times basically what it is."
*   **Scenario:** If the market approaches a low without taking it, the speaker would anticipate a move up to a high first, then potentially down further, possibly into a fair value gap.
*   **Disclaimer:** This is a speculative exercise, not a prediction.

## **Real-Time Market Observations at 10:00 AM**

### **ES (E-mini S&P 500)**

*   **Current Position:** Trading within the new week opening gap.
*   **Downside Target:** Potential repricing down to a specific level (details provided).
*   **Risk Off:** NASDAQ expanding higher indicates a "risk off" sentiment.

### **Pound Dollar (GBP/USD)**

*   **Movement:** Experienced a significant drop from 1.1985, based on a fair value gap (FVG) on the 5-minute chart at the 8:50 candle.

### **Dollar Index (DXY)**

*   **Target:** Next buy-side liquidity pool is the high from Friday of last week at 105.08.
*   **Status:** Approaching this level.

### **New Week Opening Gaps (NWOG)**

*   **Midpoint Repricing:** The market has reached the midpoint between one NWOG and another.
*   **Expectation:** Repricing to the next level is anticipated.
*   **Run:** A 15-handle run is expected.

### **Fair Value Gaps (FVG)**

*   **Usage:** Emphasizes teaching how to use them "for real," beyond basic identification.
*   **Context:** Explains how they integrate into a larger narrative.

### **Market Conditions**

*   **20 Handle Downturn:** A roughly 20 handle downturn occurred right at 10:00 AM.
*   **Patience and Self-Control:** It is important not to regret not trading. FED involvement introduces uncertainty.

### **Stop Losses**

*   **Caution:** New traders should be wary of not using stop losses, especially on volatile days.

### **Technical Analysis and Levels**

*   The presenter states that the computers fans are running hard during lowest latency mode.
*   **Dollar Index (DXY):** Has cleared the 105 buy stop.
*   **Next Target:** The high on Thursday, March 2nd at 105.18.
*   **Dollar Levels:** Identifies the levels that have cleaned out.
*   **Further Levels of Interest**:
    *   105.341
    *   105.631

### **Rejection Block**

*   Points out that this is the old high and consequent encroachment.
*   Anything shorting in here would be chasing. It would require at least one up close candle to get in sync with it if it was something like on a day that he expected a low resistance run.

### **Weak Open Gap (WOG) vs. NWOG**

*   The presenter describes taking NWOG and stringing them together for a narrative.
*   **Application:** Market reprisces to debt for purposes of fair value, not buying/selling pressure.

### **Analysis of Current Dollar Index Movement**

*   **Event Horizon:** Halfway point between both gap.

### **Current Market State**

*   The market is at a crossroads, with the dollar having reached into a box on the quad and back into its rejection block.


# **YouTube Teaching: Today's Opening Guide**

## **Introduction**

*   The speaker is producing a teaching video for YouTube this week, focusing on today's opening guide.
*   He mentions having specific rules to work with.
*   He expresses a preference for using a pen to mark up charts.

## **Market Overview and Analysis**

### **Focus on Forex Traders**

*   The speaker acknowledges that many viewers are **Forex traders**.

### **Dollar Index (DXY) Analysis**

*   He notes that the **Dollar Index** took a significant dive.

### **Dow Jones as a Barometer**

*   The speaker doesn't trade the **Dow Jones** but uses it as a barometer, similar to how he uses the **Dollar Index** with other markets.

### **SMT Divergence (Indices)**

*   When analyzing indices like **NASDAQ** or **E-mini S&P 500 (ES)**, he compares highs and lows with the **Dow Jones** for SMT (Smart Money Technique) divergence.
    *   He looks at recent highs on the Dow and compares them to ES and NASDAQ.
    *   He observes a flat trend on the Dow compared to the respective highs on NASDAQ.

### **Analysis of Algorithmically Delivered Price with Manual Intervention**

*   He acknowledges price has been delivered algorithmically, but with **manual intervention**.
*   This manual intervention involves quick pushes in sudden directions.

### **Questioning Market Liquidity**

*   The speaker questions the idea that the market randomly ran out of liquidity and moved down into an old Sunday gap opening.
*   He argues that this explanation "makes no sense."

## **Controlled Market Environment**

### **Controlled Demolition**

*   The speaker believes the market is controlled, even during manual interventions.

### **Intervention Targets**

*   Interventions are taken to levels that he teaches exist.
*   However, he cannot predict which specific level will be targeted due to the manual nature of the intervention.

### **Unpredictability of FED Actions**

*   He states he cannot anticipate **Federal Reserve (FED)** actions with a high degree of probability.
*   **Rate Announcements:** Even if rate announcements align with or miss expectations, the market's reaction can be the opposite of what's predicted.
    *   **Excuses:** When the opposite unfolds, analysts often justify it by saying it was "priced in weeks ago," without mentioning this beforehand.

### **Signature-Based Analysis**

*   He seeks a signature to justify why he thinks price will move in a certain direction.
*   He is usually correct when there isn't FED influence and tries to focus on those situations.

### **Probability and Focus**

*   He teaches students to focus on environments conducive to high probability.
*   When the FED is speaking or testifying, it's like a rate announcement with unpredictable effects.

### **Opinion vs. Market Action**

*   Everyone has an opinion on whether rates will be cut, increased, or remain the same, but these opinions don't influence market actions.
*   Markets move as they are designed to, regardless of how many people are buying or selling.

## **Real-Time Market Observations**

### **One-Minute Chart Analysis**

*   On a one-minute chart, the **Dollar Index** is making a higher high.
*   Ideally, the speaker would like to see the low taken out on ES.

### **Current Market State**

*   The **Dollar Index** has made a higher high, but ES hasn't made a lower low. This could indicate a short-term low forming and a potential trade upward.
*   The dollar is coming off its highs, and ES is trying to reach into a gap.
*   **Objectives:** Observe liquidity runs, focusing on potential buy-side above and fair value below.

### **Multi-Timeframe Analysis (Dollar Index)**

*   He is looking at the **Dollar Index** on 5-minute, 15-minute, and hourly charts to determine if it wants to keep going higher.
*   The fact that it hasn't made a higher high than its previous high is problematic for ES continuing downward, at least in the near term.

### **Dow Jones vs. ES Analysis**

*   **Dow Jones** futures (YMH2023) have made a lower low, while ES has not.
*   This disparity raises concerns about potential consolidation or a short-term reversal.

### **Trading Considerations**

*   **Absence of FED Impact:** On a day without FED influence, if already short, he would reduce his position when seeing the Dow make a lower low while NASDAQ and ES fail to do so.
    *   **Reason:** This scenario could indicate a retracement higher against the existing position.

### **Dollar Index Targets**

*   He wants to see the **Dollar Index** continue higher to 105.341 and lower lows in ES, to bring symmetry to the market.
    *   **Symmetry:** Higher highs in the dollar, lower lows in all index futures (ES, NASDAQ, and Dow).

## **Price Action Commentary**

### **Utilization of Old New Week Opening Gap (NWOG)**

*   He advises those new to trading to recognize repeating patterns.
*   **Infancy:** A new trader is identified as someone who looks at a move on the chart and wishes they could have participated in it.

### **Dollar Index Movement**

*   The **Dollar Index** is dipping below 105.181.

### **Potential Scenarios**

*   **Dollar Index Retreat:** If the dollar starts to come back down and trades into the 104.90 range, he would watch the fair value gap as potential support and a possible run-up to a higher area. This is an observation, not a trade recommendation.

### **Real-Time Scenario Walkthrough**

*   He walks through the idea of the lows not being confirmed.
*   He reiterates that if he were in a trade, he'd have most of his position off.

### **Stop-Loss Considerations (Non-FED Day)**

*   On a normal day, his stop would have been trailed near a particular high, due to the reluctance of ES and NASDAQ to make lower lows while the Dow did.

### **Missed Trade Opportunity (Non-FED Day)**

*   If price had come down to a specific level (on a normal day), he would have considered it a potential long to a higher level, aiming for a 10-handle run.

## **Technical Analysis and Market Structure**

### **Buy Side Imbalance, Sell Side Inefficiency (BISI)**

*   The market has a buy-side imbalance and sell-side inefficiency.
    *   **Measurement:** The high of one candle and the low of another, with a large movement in between.
    *   **Consequent Encroachment:** The 50% level between these two reference points.

### **Discount Levels**

*   Two discount levels are identified:
    *   Consequent encroachment of the BISI.
    *   A fair value gap.

### **Potential Long Opportunity (Non-FED Day)**

*   If price returned to the fair value gap without touching a specific higher area (on a normal day), he would use it as a long to reach that higher level for about a 10-handle run.

### **Monitoring the Dollar Index**

*   Toggle between Dollar Index charts (DXY) to see if the **Dollar Index** is rallying.
*   Ideally, the dollar should consolidate or go lower into its buy-side of non-sell-side efficiency on its 5-minute chart candle at 10:00 AM.

### **Candle Body Analysis**

*   He focuses on where the bodies of the candles are forming, as the bodies provide the narrative.
    *   **Wicks:** Wicks can do damage and trade outside the lines, but the bodies are what he monitors.

### **Dollar Index Fair Value Gap and Breaker**

*   The **Dollar Index** has a fair value gap at the 10:21 one-minute candle, representing the last line of defense.
*   It's inside the bearish breaker, which would be the 10:12 one-minute candle.
*   As long as the market doesn't vault above that, there should be no problem.

## **Real-Time Trade Idea Anatomy**

### **Logic-Based Analysis**

*   He emphasizes that a trade idea is based on logic and not simply "pushing a button."

### **Console Equipment/Fib Projection**

*   He refers to console equipment and a level of fib projection.

### **Clearance of the Rejection Block**

*   He points out that they cleared the important level mentioned before, which is the rejection block on the daily chart (indicated by a dashed line). This is not a new observation; he's discussed it in previous recordings.
*   He emphasizes that it is the Daily Chart PD (Premium/Discount) Array

### **Bearish Breaker Definition**

*   Between swing high one and swing high two, the low in between those two points is the bearish breaker.

### **Relationship Between Dollar Index and ES**

*   Lower dollar means "risk on," and "risk on" means higher ES.
*   He uses swing projections from the fib anchor to a low and then to a high to project levels on ES.

### **Non-FED Day Trade Scenario**

*   If it were a day without FED intervention, he would be trading, watching for a return to the fair value gap, with a stop-loss below that gap.

### **Premium Distribution**

*   He advises distributing long positions when the market is at a premium.
*   He emphasizes they don't need an overbought indicator to indicate when something is overbought or oversold; they are looking at the range in itself.

### **Confluence of Levels**

*   The goal is to build a confluence of levels to justify how far a retracement can go.

## **Tactical Trade Management**

### **Partial Profit-Taking**

*   He suggests taking partial profits within the first premium.
*   The goal is to target the high, where it could get nine and a half handles. It is not even taking out the buy side to get nine and a half handles.

### **Example Trade Management**

*   **Scenario:** With three contracts long, take one off at a limit right at the high.
*   **Bit/Ask Spread:** Factor in the bit/ask spread to ensure the exit.

### **Subsequent Profit-Taking**

*   Take off the remaining two contracts at the first low/the high of the candle.
*   **Adjusting the Level:** As soon as it hits that level, raise it by one tick.
*   **Market Order:** If it digs into that range, a limit order to sell would become a market order to sell at the market.

### **Final Contract Management**

*   The final contract is aimed for the midpoint or the upper end of the fair value gap, less one tick to account for the big ask spread.

## **Conclusion**

### **Stream Wrap-Up**

*   The speaker concludes the session, explaining that he needs to limit his talking to preserve his voice for tomorrow.
*   He mentions another session tomorrow due to the FED Chairman speaking at 10:00 AM.

### **Dollar Index Quick Look**

*   The **Dollar Index** traded up into its BISI and fair value gap.

### **Dow Jones Analysis**

*   The **Dow Jones** is weaker with no imbalances.

### **NASDAQ Analysis**

*   **NASDAQ** fell just short of its high, not making its way up into its BISI.

### **Appreciation and Farewell**

*   The speaker appreciates the audience for hanging out and wishes them safety.

### **Thumbs Up Request**

*   He asks viewers to give the stream a thumbs up if they found the live stream and commentary productive and informative.
*   He states that it is free to do, costs nothing, no one knows that they can do it.

### **Twitter Follow**

*   Asks viewers on Twitter to follow him there.

# Market Analysis and Trading Strategies: Pre- and Post-Powell Testimony

## Initial Market Outlook and Dollar Index Analysis

Good morning, folks! I hope everybody is doing well. Today, we're looking at day two of **Powell's testimony**, scheduled to begin in about 15 minutes.

*   We're starting with the **five-minute chart on ES (E-mini S&P 500 futures)**.
*   Initially, I'm **favoring the downside**, but this isn't a trade recommendation.

Let's quickly review the **Dollar Index (DXY)**:

*   I drew your attention to a **volume imbalance** here two weeks ago.
*   I've **maintained bullishness** on the dollar, even through recent market fluctuations.
*   My expectation is for the dollar to reach up into this **volume imbalance** and above these **relative equal highs**.

This **sets the tone for risk-off** conditions:

*   **Lower prices for ES**
*   **Lower prices for Nasdaq**
*   **Lower prices for stocks**
*   **Lower prices for Forex pairs** with the dollar as the second currency in the pair name.
*   **Bullish foreign currency** if the currency pair has the dollar *first* in its name.

## Algorithmic Price Delivery and Market Structure

I'll add the visual markers here so we can clearly see the market's movements:

*   We initially looked for a drop down to this area.
*   Then, we waited for a **shift in market structure** here.
*   We were **bullish** all through this phase, with **volume imbalances**.
*   The price rallied up, creating another, smaller **volume imbalance**.
*   Yesterday, the price traded back down into that imbalance before "rocketing up" into the **rejection block**.
    *   The rejection block is defined by the closing price of this candle.
    *   We then see a **consequent encroachment** of this wick, marking this level.
*   After that, the price moved toward the old high and ultimately up into the **volume imbalance**.

That, my friends, is precisely what you're looking for – **algorithmic price delivery**. It has nothing to do with retail trading, and it's fascinating to see these patterns repeat over and over again, as I have for three decades.

## Stream Quality on YouTube

Incidentally, for those watching the stream:

*   If you're noticing that the stream looks fuzzy or blurry (especially if you're on a cell phone), check your video quality settings.
*   Many students watch on their cell phones, though I personally prefer a bigger screen.
*   **Desktop users:** Look for the gear symbol in the lower right corner of the YouTube player. Click it to change the quality to High Definition.
*   **Cell phone users:** Tap the video screen, then tap the gear symbol in the upper right corner. Go to "Quality," then "Advanced," and choose 1440p or 1080p, or whatever your internet connection can handle without buffering.

I see people mentioning this constantly on my Twitter feed.

## Market Cooling and Upcoming Events: Non-Farm Payroll

The **big delivery on the upside**, especially with the **Powell testimony** at 10:00 AM, delivering to the specified target, "cools the jets" for me this week.

*   I know some of you are "action hounds" who are always looking for the next trade.
*   This delivery promotes patience and self-control.
*   Keep in mind that **Powell's testimony at 10:00 AM could change everything**.
    *   It could push the Dollar Index even higher and send inverse correlation pairs lower.
    *   Or, we could see a retracement back down into this area.

Once I have a **weekly objective reached, I stop trading**. I know that's hard to believe, considering I trade intraday almost every day.

**Important Reminder:** This week is a **non-farm payroll week**.

*   **Non-Farm Payroll is this Friday.**
*   **I don't trade that day, and I don't advocate that my students do either.**
*   I know some people will say, "ICT doesn't always talk about..." but if you want to showcase your trades, do it live.

## Protocol for Non-Farm Payroll Weeks:

Trading on the Thursday and Friday of non-farm payroll carries too much risk. This section is specifically for those trying to *learn* and not just spectate.

*   **Note in your journal:** Non-farm payroll weeks (typically, but not always, the first Friday of every month) require a specific protocol.
*   **Tomorrow (Thursday) is the day before non-farm payroll: We don't trade that day.**
*   **We also don't trade on non-farm payroll Friday itself.**

Some of you might be "wigging out" about missing two trading days. That's your choice.

*   As an educator, I must have rules for my students.
*   This helps build discipline.
*   **The probabilities for precision drop significantly on Thursday and Friday of non-farm payroll weeks.**

The protocol for these weeks is simple:

*   **Get all of your trading done by now (Wednesday) New York session AM session.**
*   **Once we reach 11:00 AM, it's over. Do not trade.**
*   This doesn't mean you can't demonstrate trading, just don't trade live funds.

I've never advocated for any of you to trade live funds right away, but I know some of you have. If you are, maintain this rule: **Do not trade live funds on Thursday and Friday of non-farm payroll week.**

*   Yes, the market will move.
*   Yes, there will be setups.
*   But, based on my experience, the level of precision is not as consistent on those days.

As the author of this methodology, it doesn't make sense for me to push the envelope of risk in an environment where, based on three decades of experience, it doesn't perform as well.

## The Analyst, The Trader, and The Gambler

As a rule-based trader and analyst, I must provide the trader in me with rules and protocols to keep them aligned with the analyst's expectations.

Each of you has three internal roles:

1.  **The Analyst:** The person in charge of deciding what to buy or sell.
2.  **The Trader:** The person who executes the trades – the timing, risk management, and button-pushing.
3.  **The Gambler:** The part of you that wants to take risks for the thrill of it.

*   The analyst must know what they're doing and have a rule-based strategy.
*   The analyst must discipline the trader.
*   **The trader's responsibility is to keep the gambler out of the driver's seat.**

The gambler wants to see what happens if they push the button, fueled by:

*   **Bored Trading**
*   **Curiosity Trading**
*   **Competitive Trading**
*   **Trying to keep up with the Joneses on social media**

We always try to keep the gambler out of it. That voice that says, "This looks like something I could get a part of right now. I missed 90% of the run, but I can get that last three handles, that last six pips, after it's moved 90!" That's the gambler.

**Don't go into non-farm payroll weeks, or the Thursday and Friday of that week, just to "see what happens," or "around and find out"**

Historically, this week has done damage to me. I've blown accounts (plural) trying to force something because I believed others who said, "These are the weeks you're supposed to trade! Look at all the volatility!" But the algorithms aren't keyed up for precision, and manual intervention is more likely. This means a human comes in and causes the market to go just outside of or well beyond what would be reasonably expected using the things I'm teaching you.

Acknowledging this isn't a weakness, it's a strength, knowing where the odds are against me. Classic retail traders see it as just another trading day and try to push their "edge," but their edge is dulled because the market isn't conducive to high-probability, low-risk setups.

*Rewind and write that in your journal if you didn't get it all.*

This is the rationale behind why I teach my students and why I personally remain on the sidelines on Thursday and Friday of non-farm payroll weeks. Traditionally, if I don't have anything on in the morning session, I'm done on Wednesday. I can and have traded morning sessions up to 11:00 AM, and sometimes even deviated and traded into lunch hour.

However, we can't really do that today because we have **Powell's testimony at 10:00 AM**. In about three minutes, we'll see him exert his influence on the marketplace. I don't fully believe that's what's going on, but they like to use the Fed chair to do those things.

## ES (E-mini S&P 500 futures) Analysis:

Let's move over to ES.

*   Dropping down to a **five-minute chart**.
*   It's a busy chart for an ICT chart.

**New Week Opening Gap:**

*   Tonight, I'll have a video on my YouTube channel outlining what a new week opening gap is, what to do with it, and how it's helpful.

Initially, I was watching:

*   Going to a **15-minute chart**.
*   We have a **buy-sell Equity pool here**, which we've swept above.
*   On the **60-minute chart**: this candle's low and this candle's High represent the **sibi**.
*   The favorable gap is extended here.

*Back down to the five-minute chart:*

*   Inside that high, we have a small little **Fair Value Gap (FVG)** here in the form of a Cibi.
*   Price traded up into that right at 9:30 AM.
*   Hit that beautifully, perfectly, and came back down.
*   Swept the new week opening gap, and now we're back into touching that 60-minute fear.
*   We have **relative equal highs** here.
*   That 9:30 AM move into that FVG took out the buy side.
*   Traders were caught long, taken back below the lows here, with the rejection block probably stopping them out or scaring them out.

I do not have a clear indication as to how I would engage, so we're basically just observing.

*   If you're one of those highly critical viewers who want to get to the point quickly, like yesterday, this morning may not be for you.
*   You can probably just catch this video when it's convenient for your weekend or something.
*   For the real students who are here to learn how to read price action, this is a really good exercise to watch the effects of the Fed chair talking.

It's 10:00 AM already. What has he said? Probably hasn't had time to say good morning yet. But look at the flurry of action in here, and here's our new week opening up down here.

*   Looking at the 9:30 High.
*   I'm pointing out noteworthy things for you to have in your journal, showing the points of reference I'm referring to.
*   That way, you can study it after the day closes.

*   Watch this wick here.
*   It went up into that fair value Gap.
*   Once it did that, watch what this is doing here. Where is it returning up into?
*   Yes, it touches the bottom of the 60-minute fair value Gap.
*   Where are the bodies at in these two candles in deference to this Wick?
*   Beautiful return.

The next level of interest to me (and I'm sure you saw it flashing on your screen) is on the **daily chart, way down here**.

*   We have these other tools in our repertoire.
*   Not saying that the market can't crash.
*   But that's the next thing I have.
*   Focusing on that wick here.

As you can see, I could have shorted it. You could have too. We could have ran up higher into that 60-minute fair value Gap. You have no idea, and neither do I what the Fed chair's testimony will bring in terms of volatility.

*   Look how beautiful that retracement is off that 3974.51 level.
*   It's almost like it was programmed.

*This price level here is* **3992.75**. The closing price here comes in at **3993.75**. The close comes in exactly at that price!

That's probably random to most viewers, but that's not Randomness, that's algorithmic. It goes right to that. The wicks can do the damage; they go just outside the lines. This is how the algorithm hides in plain view.

*   There are still strong deniers out there saying that there is no algorithm controlling price when there's absolutely so much evidence to argue the point.
*   Why all of you would even wrestle that idea is beyond me.
*   It relieved me because it made much more sense why the market does what it does repeatedly.

Prior to this drop off here, that handle right there is 955, and we start another candle at 10:00 AM. Powell didn't even get a chance to say anything, and right off of constable encroachment, after tapping the 60-minute fair value Gap that I mentioned, ran all the way down to...

Look at the beautiful delivery off of that into another new week opening Gap.

Take Powell out of the conversation. Say that wasn't a factor this morning. This run-up to that 60-minute Fair Value Gap...


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining all original details, context, and nuance while enhancing clarity and readability:

# Market Analysis: Algorithmic Price Delivery and Trading Insights

## Short Entry Considerations and Market Dynamics

The **Gap** would have been a short for me. I would have *smacked* that as soon as it went up and hit it. I would have done that. Why? Because you've watched me call these things live now for weeks and months on Twitter. You've watched me execute using the logs that I'm teaching you.

*   If you're going to wrestle with this and say, "Oh, this is would have, should have, could have stuff," move along.
*   There's other people out there YouTubing, and you can be entertained by them.

I would have absolutely *smacked* that as a short entry had **Powell** not been a factor this morning.

*   The reason why I would trust that is because we've already done the **buy side** here.
*   It also went up into the next **premium**, right, which is that **fair value gap** out there.

I would feel comfortable getting short there with a stop above the **fair value gap**.

*   I want to hit that at one time when it was bold face, green, all body, no wick at all.
*   When it was touching that, that would be terrifying to the average trader.
*   It doesn't make any sense to sell short into something like that, which is why it's important for you as a developing student using my concepts, you have to have the lipstick—the things that I have on my chart here.
    *   I don't have these things on my chart. It's a distraction to me to watch price with it on there because I like to keep my chart clean.
    *   But you can't do that while you're learning because you have to have the stuff on there to refer to.
    *   It's like training wheels when you first learn how to ride a bike. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
    *   Pretty soon, in a couple of months, you won't need to have the things that you're needing right now.
    *   You'll work off of a pad, just like I do. This is where all my notes are written down, and I'm constantly referring to price, my other charts, and then those key levels I have noted down, which is basically what I'm showing you here.
    *   All these levels here are just in numerical format on a pad, so I don't need to necessarily have these things on my chart, and you won't over time either.
    *   But if you choose to keep them on there, there's nothing wrong with that. Don't let me discourage you from doing it. I'm just reminding you that it's very distracting for me to have it on there.

Anyway, **rate of consequent encroachment** of that wick here after hitting the **60-minute fair value gap**, **low expansion** occurs all the way down to some random **3974.50 low**.

*   This entire run back down into that, it only went one-quarter point lower than the **3974.50 low**, and that's a gap that's already been traded to.
*   As a reminder, as I mentioned yesterday, there's folks out there that are just absolutely tore up that I'm teaching you something, and nobody's ever touched on it before.
    *   It's not bragging. It's not arrogance.
    *   I want you to understand that these things have been in front of you, and no one has ever talked about it, never seen it before. They don't teach it; they don't know it; they've never traded with it before.
    *   Everybody sees a gap. I'm not saying I invented gaps; gaps exist everywhere, but how I use those gaps and how I frame a narrative, you never hear anybody teach about how an old Gap from weeks or months ago is useful right now.
    *   You don't hear it; it's not taught, but there's logic behind it.
    *   There's logic behind weaving together a narrative.

## Algorithmic Argumentation

If there is an algorithm, okay, this is an argument for you to hold with yourself over the weekend:

*   If there is no algorithm, pray tell how does the market just randomly, between buying and selling pressure, sell off right at a consequent encroachment level in a wick that I teach you and drop immediately down into a level that I teach you that will be Revisited again and again?
*   If there is no algorithm, how is it that there are traders that don't have any information given to them in books and courses and Educators—they don't teach this stuff—so how on Earth did it just do this very thing and deliver exactly like it did?
*   It takes more faith in the religion of retail logic that all came together for that to occur. It doesn't make any sense.
*   So, anyway, let's take a look at NASDAQ real quick.

## NASDAQ and SMT Studies

*   Pretty much the same delivery, but that's not a gap; that's these are my **SMT studies**.
*   I'm just showing the **NASDAQ** and the **Dow** when I'm while I'm looking at ES.
*   Let's go back to ES and let you see it. So that's all it is, just comparing.
*   Nothing in here outside of what was just delivered, there was anything of importance to me.

## Analyzing the 60-Minute Fair Value Gap

Now, I'd be interested to see if it can mount a deeper run into that **60-minute fair value gap**.

*   Let me show you what I'm looking at specifically when I'm referring to it.
*   Scrunch this up here.

So, we have inside the upper portion of the **60 Minute fair value gap**, should we extend above because we've already dipped down in here, I was pretty aggressive, and we had a nice little retracement off of the level that is the new week opening gap.

### New Week Opening Gap Definition

When I say "the new week opening Gap," I'm not referring to the present week; I refer to every new week opening Gap as "newly opening gap."

*   If you want to have a structure to your identification.

### Labelling System for New Week Opening Gaps

If you want to have like a labeling system in your own charts, that want to have like representing what new week opening Gap, like you can label them by date using the Sunday gap opening price. That would be your new week opening gap label.

*   So, if you're referring to it, you're referring to the difference between the previous weeks Friday's closing price on settlement, okay, which you'll hear it talk about, and when we get into the video tonight, and I promise it'll be a very short video, there isn't a whole lot to it, even though it is like Alchemy, it's beautiful, isn't it?
*   It's been trending on Twitter since the first day I mentioned it weeks ago, which I think is fascinating.

### Choosing a Labelling System:

The labeling system that you can utilize is obviously up to you. You can call each one of these individual newly coconut gaps whatever you want to keep referencing or reference them, you know, in a manner that is helpful to you.

*   I don't personally require that because I know if I'm bullish or bearish, I'm looking for close proximity new week opening gaps below me.
*   So that's it's really not technically difficult to understand, as you'll see tonight.
*   It's not a lot of acrobatics that are required, but the Insight that it gives you.

## Behind-the-Scenes Market Insights

Folks, listen, listen: when I started last year, and I told you I was going to come out and teach and give you a mentorship level performance openly for free, I told you I was going to teach you things. Then we rolled into this year, and I told you I was going to show you what's going on behind the scenes, what makes these markets really tick.

*   Nobody else is teaching you that.
*   They got wonderful systems; they got profitability; they have all kinds of gadgets and setups, but they're never telling you what makes the market move.
*   They falsely attribute it to their patterns, their things, their indicators, and that has absolutely no bearing on what makes the market go up and down.
*   I understand that I'm not everybody's cup of tea, but I have exactly what everybody's looking for.
*   It's the truth, and it's undeniable. It's unrivaled. You can't you can't beat the truth.
*   You can contort it and twist it, but I'm laying it out there for you.
*   I'm showing you exactly what you should be what you should be expecting to see in price if there is an algorithm. These things wouldn't unfold like they do, or if there isn't, I algorithm, I should say it wouldn't be doing these things.
*   But because they continuously do them, there has to be a control mechanism, and the way I discovered it is I noticed that they would repeat many times within a 10-minute window.
*   It always repeats over and over and over again within the same expected 10 minute window, and these certain 10-minute Windows would occur in specific hours of the day on specific days of the week within specific months of the year within specific seasonality, and the data doesn't lie.
*   It's there. Then when you start looking at Price action live, like we're watching here, and you anticipate these things on the phone, you expect to see it.
*   You expect to see these things if there is some kind of control mechanism in here, it's not just buying and selling pressure because to me it makes no sense when I finally step back and said, you know what, there shouldn't be a free-for-all because that means a hostile entity could come in and crash our markets.
*   If it was all to selling pressure, we would keep a rogue Nation with lots of money coming in what would prevent a large Nation coming in putting lots of money or a group of Nations coming in to pressure by selling short our equities Market.
*   Believe me, there are people in countries out there that are not friendly to us in the states and that would absolutely be a weapon if it was just like they teach us it is it's a free market no it's not it's controlled is it as it should be controlled there should be a mechanism and if it's a business that means it has a a process an algorithm that it follows and you shouldn't be afraid of it.
*   You shouldn't be upset the fact that it's rigged you should be thankful that it's rigged that's what gives you the edge that you have because if it was absolutely 100 random nobody could consistently Beat It nobody could and you should take comfort in that.
*   My first week when I realized that there had to be some kind of control and at first I was angry like that's why I lost everything well no I lost because I didn't know what I was doing see the difference there responsibility this responsibility and for many of you out there that listen to me there always taking shots at me about how there isn't an algorithm because you know somebody's cousin's Uncle who's a bank Trader and they don't trade this way when I'm talking about a tear a little bit higher than him or her they wouldn't know this because they're indoctrinated with all of their learning the Roman sex movies they only know what they've been trying to debut this is what the market does all we're trying to do is follow these tools these things that have no bearing on price no and when you strip it away peel back the onion every layer at a time you start seeing things that just repeat two consistently too frequently too precise.

Look at that fair value I mean the new week opening gap down there at 39.74 and a half and look we're at right now isn't that beautiful like that's beautiful to see something that is completely hidden from everybody else outside this community they had no expectation of seeing it going around those levels they had no expectation whatsoever but you're seeing it you've been seeing it day after day after day after day delivering and what's actually occurring.

*   I mentioned it before, but because you selected your first time scene, similarly when you're coming to the channel, but a new week opening Gap is a real dynamic fair value.
*   It's a range between two specific price points that are fundamental, if you want to call it that.
*   Where did we close the previous week on Friday, and where Did We Begin trading this new week on Sunday.
*   Between those two price points, there's what? There's uncertainty, and uncertainty builds what? Opportunity.
*   Where there's a difference of opinion, that's where the trade exists.
*   Everyone that thinks it's gone higher opposed Traders thinks it's going to go lower.
*   That means you have a buyer and a seller. That's the reason why the newly opening Gap works because there is a real liquidity related.
*   There's a separation between those two price points previous Friday's closing Sunday's opening price.
*   So what the market algorithm does it delivers buyers and sellers I'll take it there you might be fortunate enough to be in a mood that rise to these levels you did not push it there everyone on the trade with you in that right direction did not push it there it's going there regardless that's the part you don't understand and I don't care who you are I don't care who you worked for who you work for now it doesn't change the facts that this is going on every single day and I'm predicting it I got case studies after case studies on Twitter and now Traders are using it making real money price is going to that range between Friday's closing price and Sunday's new opening price to offer to offer fair value to the marketplace for you and I not necessarily it's for large fund interest it's to get large funds to bring their trades into the marketplace because what smart money they're not doing one contracts they're not trading five Handles in a day they're putting in size and how they put size on they have to have a counterparty that is equally if not more interested than they are.
*   So the market delivers it by algorithmic principles and when that price gets delivered because it's going there anyway once it goes there large funds either come in or get taken out and that provides the counterparty liquidity for this entity that is deemed smart money which is not Bank Traders at UBS City credit Swiss we're talking up above them the folks that aren't they're not going to be on social media and you're not going to be interviewed on CNBC okay I'm sorry but there's a whole different category that you're just not aware of and that's who's engaging like this that's why it's not in books that's why no one's talked about before because they're not supposed to talk to you they're not supposed to be divulging anything and here's this Joker on YouTube talking to you about it I'm just talking about demos I'm just talking about paper trades that's all I'm talking about the language I created that's all we're talking about so we're halfway between one new week opening Gap and the lower one that made the low of the day so far here and we're at the midpoint of that long Wick so that's consequent encroachment so I want my eyes there I'm watching it here I believe I'll have the video up at 10 pm my time so that way don't be sitting like on baby breath you know waiting for the video to drop and you're proud of that about 10 o'clock tonight my my local time which is East Coast time on the U.S that's what I'm looking up it'll probably be about 15 minutes or less of a video it's not going to be very long at all very short succinct right to the point this is what you do is how you make them and it's how you dress your chart with it thank you note the reaction halfway on that Wick there's your consequent person at 39 80 and three quarters the low on that candle comes in at they're not 80 and a half I only went one one quarter of a 0.1 tick below consequent encouragement and then look at the reaction there that is tradable that's algorithmic delivery random at all so even this sloppy mess you can still see signatures and notes that's the benefit of us being together today that's all I'm doing and pointing out things that I want your attention on when you're watching every day every day what prevents us from going in and pushing a button today is the uncertainty that the market maker okay the market maker that is in control of the algorithm that can stop the algorithm from delivering on its macros and manually intervene and reprice wherever they want it to go and you don't know when that's going to happen when the Fed chair is talking I don't know that which is the reason why I tread carefully and I don't do anything I observe it keeps me close to the market by watching it it's a wonderful exercise for you as a developing student and that way you're not becoming impulsive or chasing profits whereas you're trying to learn the science behind how these algorithms operate so think about the delivery from consequent encouragement down here which I talked about at the time it's not Cherry Picked okay I told you to watch this at the very second as it was trading there and where it

## Market Maker Intervention and Trading Caution

What prevents us from going in and pushing a button today is the uncertainty that the **market maker** – okay, the **market maker** that is in control of the algorithm – that can stop the algorithm from delivering on its macros and manually intervene and reprice wherever they want it to go, and you don't know when that's going to happen when the Fed chair is talking.

*   I don't know that, which is the reason why I tread carefully and I don't do anything. I observe it.
*   It keeps me close to the market by watching it. It's a wonderful exercise for you as a developing student, and that way you're not becoming impulsive or chasing profits, whereas you're trying to learn the science behind how these algorithms operate.

So, think about the delivery from consequent encouragement down here, which I talked about at the time.

*   It's not Cherry Picked.
*   I told you to watch this at the very second as it was trading there and where it...


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining all original details, context, and nuance while enhancing clarity and readability:

# Market Analysis: Algorithmic Price Delivery and Trading Insights (Continued)

## Analyzing Price Action and Fair Value Gaps

We delivered from here all the way back up into this **60-Minute fair value Gap**. Where's the buy side resting? Right above here. So, we went all the way down to this **new week opening Gap low**. We're inside the **60-Minute fair value Gap** again. We've already did the buy side here, so that's not what we're interested in. We want to see, does it want to go above this high and trade in this order block and completely maybe come all the way back up to the high end of that 60 minute fair value gap, because it's already pierced this low and this low. What was below these lows here? Sell Side.

### Determining Target Levels After Liquidity Sweeps

How far can it go down below an old low? ICT, how far? How do you know how far it's going to go and it won't keep going?

*   **New week opening gaps**
*   **New day opening gaps**
*   **Opening range gaps:** Gaps between where we closed yesterday and where we open at 9:30.

There's three specific gaps right there. I'll have the new week opening Gap tutorial video tonight, but I don't know when I'll do the new day opening gap video, but that'll be next. They're not going to be opening range Gap video is that what you'll have wrong the details on gaps and how I internalize them, how the algorithm will refer to them.

There's so much, if you just simply put down the willingness to want to arm wrestle me and stop trying to say I'm rebranding anything, but none of this is anywhere. It's not in any books. You can get yourself a million dollars if you can find it in print. Told you that 1996, that's when it was codified. Sorry, that's me.

### Range Movement Example

But that range movement from the **consequent encroachment** of this wick after clearing the sell side below this low and this. I'm going to drop a line on it, so that way you can see. So below this low here, oops, sorry, if you apparently okay. So we have two lows here that are relatively equal, and you always want to put it right on the lower of the low between the two. So that's I'm a little bit below it, that's okay, but from here and here.

*   So what's resting below that? Sell side liquidity, sell stops.
*   Traders that would want to protect a long position, they put the sell stop below that.
*   Traders that want to sell short on a breakout, thinking that weakness that comes in, they would see that as what? A reason to be short.

So, if what I'm teaching you is we attack that liquidity and the question that comes up a lot is, okay, how do you know how far if you want to be buying these stops? Because I teach how to do that in the core content that was alternated last year on my YouTube channel.

### Mentorship and Core Content

And folks, please stop emailing me asking me to join my paid mentorship. I'm mentoring you right now for free. This is mentorship. Okay, I don't want your money. I'm never gonna charge your money. This is it. Okay, I mean, I'm I'm having fun doing this. You should be keeping notes and benefiting from all of it.

### Determining Buy Points After Liquidity Sweeps

But the question many times comes up is, you know, how can you trust? How do you know? How do you know, then, when it drops below old lows to be a buyer? How do you know how far I can go? Like, where would you place your stop? Well, in this case, it helps a lot when you have information like the newly company Gap, because we would expect it to drop down. This was in the chart. It wasn't off screen. It was mentioned to you that this is an interesting level. If we drop lower, this is where it's going to likely draw to. It's below these relative equal lows, so below here is sell sign.

*   So there's layered sell stops below these lows that you don't know.
*   The depth of Market the Dom, those orders can be spoofed.
*   Just because you see them prompting you saying there's this many willings to be a seller or a buyer at a particular level doesn't mean that that order is going to be there when price gets there.
*   Spoofing is a real thing.

Spoofing is when you put an order there, and then by the time it gets or gets close to it, they pull the order away, so it's a gimmick. Okay, I'm sorry if you if you'd like to use that tool, and it's helpful to you, that's great, but don't argue and say that that's the reason why the Market's moving around, because it's not.

*   But below these lows, they're sell sign.
*   So how far can it drop down below old lows?

### Tools for Identifying Target Levels

*   **New week opening Gap**
*   **New day opening Gap**
*   **Opening range Gap**

There's your three tools. How far can you trust the move above an old high for a turtle soup? I just taught it to you. Oops, sorry, can't it.

### Market Dynamics and Algorithm Behavior

So the market drops all the way down through relative equal lows into some random level and guy goes one tick outside of it. Why? Remember, I was teaching you it likes to create these little Mohawks, okay, these little Mohawks that overlap a little bit. Why? Because there has to be what? The bidness difference.

So if a Trader wants that 39.74 and a half, it has to trade where? 39.74 and a quarter, and that's what you got here. Everything makes sense when you understand it that way, instead of taking your price patterns and animal harmonics and Elliott wave things and try to cram all that stuff into a reason why price is going up.

It has no reason that has no basis at all for why like the markets are going to be booking this way. It's going to go up for buy stops or it's going to go up to redeliver to an inefficiency like a fair value Gap. That's it. It's either going to go up for that reason for longs to sell their long positions too, or it's going up there to start a new sell-off, so that way shorts can be implemented, and it's going to be looking for an opposing liquidity.

*   The market goes down for sell stops that goes below and the low or at Old lows where it goes down to an inefficiency that it will reprice to.
*   That's it.
*   If it's not doing that, guess what it's doing? Consolidating.

### Market States: Bullish, Bearish, and Consolidation

It is that hard, folks? I get complaints all the time from people that don't really want to learn, or they sell something they have a competitive nature because they're trying to sell their thing, and I'm out here teaching what makes the market really move, and it's booking perfectly to the tick. No say I'm over complicating things. I'm not complicating anything that is absolutely easy.

*   It's going up for one of two reasons.
*   Going down for one of two reasons.
*   Or it's consolidating.

I teach you when it's going to consolidate when we're ahead of big news or event like this, we don't know what pal is going to say and how the market makers are going to utilize that, so what is it doing? It's consolidating. We're not trading. Why? Because it's likely to do this, and if it does move, it's uncertain, so you can't really trust it. So there you go. Now you know when the Market's going to consolidate. I just taught you. I've taught you before, but I just reminded you this is what it looks like.

*   But when you're bullish and when I'm bullish, I'm looking for one of two things to happen.
    *   It's going to go up to buy stops above a high or relative equal highs, or it's going up to a premium fair value Gap, some sign up some kind of inefficiency where the market has dropped in the previous.
    *   I don't know, it could be as far as 60 days back, some old high, some old price decline where there is a fair value Gap is going to go up into that level there to be price.

That's the only two reasons why price is going to go up for me. That's it. It's simple, isn't it? It's very, very simple. That is not complicated no matter how much you want to torture it, it's never going to submit to being complicated. That's easy. It's going up for stops or it's going up for a fair value Gap. Boom, done over simple as that.

Are you bullish? Okay, you're looking for one of two things. Is there a fair value gap? Nope, there ain't no fair by gas so what's gonna go for it? The stops baby. It's gonna go right up into those buy stops just like you're seeing it happen right there.

Is it complicated when you look at it that way? Honestly, I'm asking sincerely because I don't believe it is. I don't believe it's complicated. It's very simplistic and it's not it's nothing that you should be wrestling with and trying to feel overwhelmed with, but you're trying to learn it too fast and you can't rush it.

### The Learning Process and Market Observation

It takes these types of things here sitting here and watching price action when we were down here. Okay, when we were down here, I said watch that Wick. Okay, that's not cherry picking that's me taking your attention right to a very specific price level not a Zone, not a Zone a very specific price level the midpoint between the closing price and the low of that candle is consequent approaching, and I told you as this candle was dipping down in here I said watch that level right here, and then I said we want to see what we want to see it trade back above deeper into that 60 Minute fair value gap, which is that pink shaded area and more specifically aim for the buy side liquidity resting above here. Why? Because we've already worked and utilized this fair value Gap multiple times, so if it's going back up here it's not going back up here for this, it's going back up for what the buy stops resting above that.

Is that complicated? Was that complicated at all in my just my delivery about it? It's not complicated folks, that's not complicated. What you're feeling if you think it's complicated is you're feeling this insatiable desire to be able to mimic what I'm doing immediately, and that is not going to happen.

It takes time it takes time doing what we're doing here reading price action when there's no trade involved, you're not in you're not influenced by the the profit or loss you don't care you're indifferent to it and that's exactly that's exactly what you need to be doing while you're learning how to trade, you need to learn how to read price first and no educator pushes this part because they want your money they want your subscription they want your everything to paying them I don't need that I'm giving you my time for free I could be out here doing whatever I want to do right now and I'm spending it with you.

### The Investment of Time and the Value of Free Education

Who's making the greater investment here? Me or you? That's what it boils down to because a lot of you aren't really trying to learn, you want something to be easy one two three watch a video one time and you'll be able to go out there and do it right away and I'm sorry I don't have that for you you can't get this level Precision with watching a video a couple times and you know there it is you got it you got to be in the charts and that's why I unfortunately separate and divide the people I'm very divisive and I don't shy away from that because I want to know right away if you're a weak-minded impatient person and you can't listen to the lectures and jaw boning you won't make it here so leave the ones that go through this they're the ones that make every one of these people that I'm going to be interviewing that make money with real money they listened they did the things I told him to do and didn't do the things I told him not to do that's what separates him from you what they're willing to put themselves through.

### The Simplicity Behind Market Complexity and Codified Logic

These markets are extremely complicated but I have removed that complication I've applied a science to it I've literally codified a logic so that way you can go in and see exactly exactly what to anticipate when to expect it why it should happen I covered every base for you every base there's no reason why anybody watching these live streams Do not sit there and think to themselves what the hell am I doing why haven't I been doing this this makes perfect sense this is exactly how I want to trade I want to see the market like this this is like knowing what's going to happen and that's why it's called futures we're predicting the future not everybody can do it which is the reason why majority people lose but I have a transferable skill that you can get from me and all you have to do is show up to show up there's no PayPal there's no credit cards new coupon codes needed new Black Friday sales.

I love this I live this is my entire life I'm passionate about it I'm passionate about teaching I love transforming people into Financial dynamos and you're about to see some of them some of them have done extremely well others very very well but more more than not you're going to see them in their own face their own Expressions share what it was like for them and I'm going to ask them questions some of the questions you guys gave me as a as a list of you know things that you would like to ask if it was you asking a profitable ICP statement because I didn't want to just go in and here's my Cherry Picked you know questions I'm giving you all an opportunity to go in on my Twitter and tell me what questions you would like to see me ask them I don't want to do longer than an hour I think an hour is really a lot but I am going to present each one of the students that have reached out to me I have a lot of them to email me and it's not the people that's you know done spreadsheets okay these people have made money they have Broker statements they have interviews with funded companies they have cash withdrawals and receipts so we're not talking about people that don't demos okay we're not talking about Market replay reports on ninjatrader we're talking about real money that's what I asked for that's what you all wanted to see and they're all going to sit down face to face with me and it'll be a pre-recorded so that way everything is professionally done nobody can interrupt that soon if I get my children my dogs come in looking at all that stuff out live I I don't want to be distracted by that and the questions will be emailed to all of them so that way it allows them to have their answers prepared like when I was being interviewed by corpse like I didn't know what that guy was going to ask me and some questions you know if a if a person is shy and you may be talking about money isn't a comfortable thing for some people other people are like I can't wait to get on ict's jam and flex I can't wait that's cool but not everybody's like that and it'd be easy for me to cause some kind of a delay or have the expression later on you shared on another comment in the video or Twitter post where they said oh I wish I would have remembered this you know if I ask and say you know what was your what was your worst trading debt because that's one of the questions I'm going to ask like what was your worst trading day and how did you deal with that and how do you deal with losing like what's your what's the procedure you go through you know those are questions that if you aren't prepared to talk about that and it's a wrestling match that you've gone through it might cause you to shy away from being honest and I want the questions in their hands first so that way they can wrestle with it talk about it with themselves and say okay he's going to ask me this and people are going to hear me talk about that how do I want to respond I don't want to be shell-shocked and I don't want to do any kind of gotcha questions okay because that's like the thing that everybody wants to do they want to I gotcha you know I've got you out there I'm embarrassed you I'm not trying to embarrass anybody I want them to be 100 honest and I want the interview to be organic in no surprises because I think it would be unfair for any student any person being interviewed to get a question upside their head say oh yeah by the way um how many times has your uh your spouse stepped out to hide the marriage you know that type of thing not that.

# Market Analysis: Algorithmic Price Delivery and Trading Insights (Continued)

## Interview Preparations and Testimonials

This would be like that, but you know what I'm saying? Like, things that would be unsavory for an interview. We're here to watch people give a testimony on how they make money, what they do, how long did it take them, what did they have to struggle through, what's their goals, what is their routine in the morning, or what session do they trade? These are all questions I plan on asking, and some of you I've seen other questions that I didn't really think about that are really good, and I'm going to utilize that. So I have to find a way for them to have their responses in mind, okay, so that way we don't go over an hour. I don't want to be, you know, I'm not going to be doing a lot of the talking; the only thing I'm doing is asking the question and prompting, keeping it moving along, but I want these students themselves talking.

### Public vs. Private Interviews

I want to hear this is my opportunity more so than you. I'm interested in hearing their testimony, like I would have been willing to do this for private reasons, but I've made it public that I will be doing it and sharing it publicly, so they all know that it's going up on my YouTube channel. So if you're afraid to show your face, you're going up there, and I want you to give me permission to do that. If you don't want to do that, then obviously, you know, the interview ain't going to happen.

### Authenticity and Avoiding Misrepresentation

I will not be doing it on **Twitter Spaces**. I don't think that's genuine. I could be hiring people. You know what I mean? Like, anybody else out there could claim and say, oh yeah, he's hired somebody to do that. You don't see the person, you don't see their expressions, you don't see their emotions when they're talking about the good and the bad experience. I want you to see, which is exactly why I watch **YouTubers** when they live stream. I want to see their face. I want to see the expression when they talk about things that they were successful in because their face will tell you. I want to see their expression when they talk about the painful things because their face is going to tell you when you're hiding your face and you're talking about things like that, it's hard to get to the root of what they had to go through. And if we're going to talk about it, let's really talk about it, right?

### Respect for Interviewees and Open Invitations

I have a lot of respect for anybody that will be willing to do this, and I have a long list of people that have reached out to me, so I have interviews for months. And don't be upset if I haven't reached out to you yet because there's a lot of you. I promise you, if you email me and you want to do the interview and you have proof that you're profitable with broker statements and funded account withdrawals and interviews with the company that funded you, you are absolutely 100% invited to have a conversation with me.

I want to hear your story, I want to hear testimony, and everybody else I'm sure would love to see that. If that's something you want to see and you're interested in seeing, give this video a thumbs up. Let them know because they may be sitting on the fence about it and maybe you're shy about it like, well, maybe what I mean wasn't enough money? Listen, if you're making money, don't think that there's a threshold.

### Interviewee Selection and Profitability Proof

The first two guys are obviously Behemoth, they've taken pretty sizable, you know, chunks of money out of the marketplace. I'm only using them first because they are the first ones that sparked his whole interest and I have people that have done eighty thousand, fifty thousand, forty thousand, a hundred thousand, two hundred thousand, three hundred thousand. You're gonna see it folks, these people have receipts, and you can't argue with that. They are doing it, and that to me is very inspirational as a mentor because they did that on their own. I never one time told them to take any of those trades, and I never told them to be funded. They made their own, their own initiative, took their own initiative, and they did it themselves. It was organic, 100% organic, and that to me is a Maverick, that to me is a Dynamo, that to me is awesome. I mean, that fires me up because they took the initiative to go out there and do something.

They didn't listen to the naysayers out there and say, oh, this stuff is complicated, all this stuff is fake, it's a fraud, it's this thing. You're not going to convince these folks. They're pulling down money, spendable money, not Market replay reports, not demo profits, not paper trading, okay? They're paying taxes on this money, big difference, big difference. And I was surprised at the response I got, and there's a it's a lot, I might have to do more than one a week, I mean, it's it's a lot. I mean, I guess it would be reasonable to expect at home with such a community size of ours and so many people now getting into it.

## Real-Time Market Observation and Algorithmic Precision

Anyway, so while we didn't see a barn burner of a mood this morning and we didn't have a trending model, I gave you something real time to observe. We watched the newest opening Gap below, and then I mentioned that we were trading down here, watch the Costco encroachment there, and then we would want to see it run up into the upper portion of that shaded area, which is what we did, and more specifically take out the buy side here. So we've done that. So the difference between that would be, we'll call it 81, so so 81 to 4002. huh? 20 handles or so, that's not bad. What would 20 handles do for you? What if you just got five handles out of that 20 units, which is what I teach all my students to aim for, is a very low rung objective when you first start out. It's easy to see five Handles in a day several times, but you aren't going to see these types of setups just because you watch the video like you have to know a lot of things.

You have to be in the charts watching it paint key off a specific times of the day look for things that have already occurred which was not when I outlined the sell side below here these relative equal lows we went down below it here beautiful delivery that's precise you can't deny it rolls back up in and then one more time tries to make an attempt to go down here but there's no reason why. Why is there no reason? ICT how could I trust that? How did you trust that? talk about it because you could do it wrong in front of everybody and they could have been laughing at you.

### Algorithm-Driven Market Repricing

What I've outlined here at the sell side below these relative equal lows, it goes down to a logical level, not some random place, not some random Zone. I didn't refer to anything harmonic down here. These levels were already on my chart when it went down there and then taking your attention to that level right there this failure swing you can now anticipate them if you have the backdrop the foundation behind it that we've already went below these lows for sell side and it went to a level that would be expected think about what's going on here am I doing that I'm stating that the algorithm will go back down to this level below these lows go there and be content with that and then look to do what reprice for an opposing liquidity or inefficiency we had both by side and the remaining portion of that 60 Minute fair value got in the Shaded area I don't need it to go all the way up to the top I just needed to go back to the buy side here.

So smart money was buying below these lows notice it's doing that when it goes down here this area here which is the midpoint of this Wick let me go back in case you guys just showed up we were looking for this newly opening gap down here it delivered it at 39.80 and three quarters it came down to 39.50 and 39.80.50 that's the low look up here up here in Upper left-handed corner that candle's low it's 39.80.501 tick below consequent encouragement that is below this low and this low so the algorithm is remembering what it's referring back to this low and this low because they're relatively equal it does not know listen folks listen it does not know your stop it doesn't know my stop it doesn't know how many stops your broker does but the algorithm has no idea it doesn't reference it like that it just refers to these points these **PD arrays** so the market does what it reprices back down below those lows which is a discount and consequent encouragement they're all measurable and there's no need to go back down to that low why because already repriced to the new week opening Gap and done what the sell side has been purged this is just returning back to a point of reference for smart money to accumulate Longs if they're going to buy here in their quote unquote smart money and they are using what I teach as a market efficiency Paradigm that means they're going to buy stops that are below the market in the form of sell side and they're going to distribute their long positions to buy side that's resting above the market willing buyers at a higher price that's these thoughts right here so they're buying sell side liquidity below these lows here and and consequent encroachment They Don't Fear The algorithm read pricing down here because they know it's already done its job big big big huge step forward in your understanding about price action if you can see that.

### Trading Logic and Market Efficiency

So if they buy here and I talked about this live it's not like I'm going back in time because it's already happened I said this live here for you so that we can see it the logic is real folks it's real if they're buying that what are they holding for they're not holding for harmonic patents they're not looking for Elliott waves and all that other stuff they're not counting waves they're not doing any of that stuff they're simply looking for the inefficiencies above the marketplace where is it in here nowhere here we've already done that several times buying here they're going to go exactly where I said it was going to go the remaining portion of that 60 Minute fair value guy up here that hasn't been traded to once it went into once it went lower here we've only delivered one time here we went up to a quarter of it here which is again not random then it went to halfway consequent encroachment and then ran through it like I said that's where the buy side is so smart money buys discount sells to a premium buy stocks that resting above here they knew those buyers wanted to buy the market when it was down here when they're down here smart money the paradigm shift that you're being taught to have in looking at Price action because it's algorithmic is you're buying it here with the same mindset that they have smart money sees this as buying sell stops at the most opportune time it's the precise time folks it's precise you can't you can't make it any better than this the logic is right there and buying that with the expectation of seeing go where rate to those buyers that want to buy High now they don't want to buy High to buy a long position they have a cell they have a short and they're holding on to their position here Maybe maybe there wasn't a lot of shorts it doesn't make a difference because the address doesn't know the level of float that resides above that it means the number of orders how many buy stocks are wrestling about that high I don't know you won't ever know the algorithm itself does not know buying it cheap selling it to people that want to buy it higher why because I'm I'm targeting I'm targeting their inability to know how to trade I'm targeting their Shield their defense I'm busting it in like the SWAT I'm literally going through it I'm teaching you how to do that I'm sorry I'm sorry if it doesn't meet the nicey nice feel that you think investing is supposed to be about it's not like that folks This Is War and when you look at the charts I have absolutely no moral Conflict at all about taking your money or anybody else's money when you're on the wrong side of the marketplace because you all signed the same risk disclosures when you open up your account everybody knows that you're likely to lose money so if I'm buying down here I'm doing what smart money's doing I'm told you that that's what's gonna happen there from here watch that and we want to see it deliver up to this area again but more specifically the upper half why because it only went to here leaving from this high up to the high shaded area here that's that's not been repriced to we only pass through one time here then up to a quarter so think about it like this the range on that hourly fair value Gap has been repriced to here right there at that moment then this High here takes it up to that level so the remaining portion of that fair value Gap in my mind I'm seeing that range left I'm ignoring all this see you're looking at all these things trying to guess which one I'm should have been looking at I'm teaching you how to internalize it because this is the part that the algorithm sees now it doesn't need to look at all these other highs this is the one that matters now because it's traded up inside that old 60 Minute fair that you got but it's left in this portion of it where it has not redelivered to it it's only been offered sell side so the efficiency model is that price needs to trade up into that area and deliver price that way it does two things it does that redelivery and and goes right for the buy stocks I told you I was going to aim for Now isn't it convenient isn't it convenient that the market just so happens to run right off there clear those buy stops and now we're right back in the middle of the range again hello hello are you paying attention are you paying attention are you playing with your Game Boy are you texting your girlfriend unless this guy go off on YouTube no you need to be paying attention taking notes folks this stuff repeats every freaking day every day I talk about it in Twitter I tell you exactly what candle to look at I tell you exactly what it's going to be aiming for I've been doing it for months my private students have watched me call this on a daily chart just the same way and it can be done on a one minute chart five minute chart second chart yes that's less than a minute you cannot absolutely cannot find anything [ __ ] better than this I'm sorry this is perfect this is the market and if that upsets you I'm sorry but you're gonna have to grow up because if you really want to know how to do this if you really want to know how these markets book you came to the right place Mr Wizards World we're here we're here every day talking about the technical science and the stuff that really works and it's undeniable it's unrivaled the Precision cannot be found anywhere else and that's awesome it's encouraging when you see it when you finally get your hands on it and you see it unfold day after day week after week month after month year after year it's infectious it's intoxicating you become an alcoholic you can't imagine doing it any other way even in this sloppy range like this folks even a sloppy Rings just like this it's not chaos it is not chaos it's all scripted now on better days when we don't have the effects of the FED chairman potentially saying something that could be utilized in the Smoke screen and reprice completely outside of the scope of what would be reasonable we can see trending days and keep on adding to the position until it rolls to the far extreme of the daily range high or low some of you might like to think that that's the only way you're going to trade and that's that's your model wonderful that's nothing wrong with that that's exactly what I'm doing this for you're going to find your model before November you're going to know exactly how you not everybody collectively how you yourself the individual watching this right now and every time I do a live stream you're going to learn the thing that you resonate closest to that makes the most sense to you you're

## Developing a Profitable Trading Mindset

### Focus and Elimination of Distractions

You're going to see something that resonates with you, something that clicks and makes perfect sense. Maybe you'll decide, "Damn it, that's exactly how I see things!" and that becomes your focus. You might say, "I don't care about the fair value gap; I don't care about a breaker; I don't care about new week opening gaps. This is what I'm going to do." Wonderful! And when you get there, bloom where you're planted. Don't Tinker with it. No matter what else I teach, don't Tinker with it because you're here to learn how to make money. You're not here to play video games, okay? You're not here to impress people on social media. You're not here to dance for people because they want to see you prove that you can make money—screw them. You have bills to pay. You have ends to meet. You have places to go and people to take care of. You don't have time to be dancing around for people that don't matter. None of these people matter that are going to demand you to do something for them. You are here to develop a skill set while you can, because this year, I'm done.

*   The second Friday of November, we're done.
*   **ICT**'s done mentoring.
*   There's no more mentoring, okay?

So, you have to show up, you have to take notes, you have to put the work in. I promise you, I [ __ ] guarantee you, you will absolutely know what the hell you're doing come November, but you have to show up every day. Stop dancing around and adding [ __ ] to this. "Oh, I'm going to bring supply and demand things to this. I'm going to bring elevations." Stop. Leave all that stuff at the door. If you want to pick it up when we're done in November and add it back to everything else, go right ahead at that time. I don't give a [ __ ] but while we're doing this, this is all that matters. This is it. This is the truth. Nothing else matters but this.

### Undeniable Truth in Algorithmic Trading

You cannot argue, you cannot resist it. It's being shown to you beforehand. You guys [ __ ] the moon. "Oh, you'll never see him go out here in live stream. You'll never see him outline all this stuff because it doesn't work." Dude, I'm doing it every [ __ ] day, every day like clockwork. You can set your watch to me. It's perfect. That's how you would expect it if it was an algorithm, wouldn't you expect it to be like this?

### Passion and Dedication

So, you're thinking, "What the hell just happened? This guy usually put me to sleep when I'm watching his views." Oh yeah, well, this is what it's like when I'm live. I'm bipolar, and if that bothers you, go somewhere else. I can't not be me. But we're talking about something that I'm passionate about. I'm absolutely passionate about this. I'm passionate about your success. I want you to succeed. I want you to make money. I want you to stop working and do this on your own, carve out your own [ __ ] paycheck. I want you to have that, don't you? Don't you want that? Are you here just playing around? Because if you're here just watching [ __ ] on YouTube because you're [ __ ] bored, you're wasting your time. You're wasting your time.

### Market Stability and Algorithmic Consistency

This is going to keep working until they take away the markets entirely. It's going to keep working. The market is not going to change the algorithm. I ain't changing [ __ ] it works perfectly.

### Initial Challenges and Overcoming Distractions

Is it going to be hard in the beginning because you have all these other things that you're trying to wrestle with? Absolutely. Just like it was for me. I added all kinds of dumb stuff – books and courses and things that I thought maybe [would explain] things going up and down the marketplace. It's all dumb, it's stupid, and some of them have really good marketing. They can think, "Wow, this is it. This is the thing I've been looking for." No, it's not. It's the thing you're being distracted with right now. And when you see, unfortunately, a little bit of success in it and you falsely attribute it, you falsely attribute it like a religion. "Oh, the market went up because my harmonic Camelback said it was going to go up there." Oh man, get out of here! Add-on patterns have nothing to do with billions of dollars at risk, okay? I'm sorry, it doesn't work like that. Does it work like that?

*   The Market's going to go where the money is.
*   If there ain't the money in there, they're going to engineer it.
*   It's the way it works.

### Example of Retail Trader's Misunderstanding

Think about that high right here [on the chart]. Buy stops [are above it]. Somebody's short. We don't know. Retail Rick, he's short here. He's going to put a protective stop loss in there because the books say, "Put your stop loss right above the high." He feels great when it goes down. He's going through all this chop. He's thinking, "Okay, maybe it's just one of those moments where I have to wait. **ICT** talks about this right here as a fair value gap. I gotta trust it." He don't know what he's doing because he watched three videos and now all of a sudden he's a professional, right? The market drops down. He's thinking, "All right, I'm all in now. I'm adding to it. It's great. Go watch TV. Go play golf. I'm gonna be good for the rest of the day. My Stop's in place." What did you make a mistake? He traded with logic that doesn't work. He doesn't know about the new week opening gap. He doesn't understand liquidity. He doesn't understand the fact that this day is going to be consolidation because of the Fed. The Market's already delivered this week, folks. It went to that dollar objective. It's not non-payroll week.

### The Mindset of Big Money Entities

Who's in the hurry right now? What big money entity, who's going to think to himself, "You know what, I need to do right now? I need to take all of our customer assets and put them at risk because non-farm payroll Friday is lit. We got to get in there and make all the money on Friday. Let's get in our head because, you know, it might be a big mover." I'm sorry, but that's not how this business works. Sorry. A lot of you bring comic book logic to trading when you need a PhD level education. You need to understand how the human mind thinks, how it behaves under pressure, when it's in reward. They feel like they can't lose, and that's why you see these sudden rips [in the] other direction.

### Market Manipulation and Spoofing

They don't want to give them the chance to realize they're wrong and collapse their trade. [It's all about] removing [orders] what? Just like spoofing, just like spoofing on a depth of market. They don't want them to pull those orders. So what happens? They have to run for them aggressively and quickly, otherwise they can't participate and utilize them as counterparty to their selling of their long position. They accumulated down here where I told you.

### Simplicity in Trading Logic

Folks, that's not complicated. That is not complicated. What's complicated for you is you want to push a button and take a trade to make money right now, because that's the only definition for you that this works is if it makes you money right now. The few times that you've spent with me so far this year, you're going to fail if you have that mindset.

### Learning vs. Trading and Avoiding Impulsive Actions

You have a lot to learn. You should not be trading at all this year if you're here to try to learn. That means you're not trading. Close your Live account. Don't even leave it open because you're going to do something impulsively. You're going to see me doing a series of weeks of runs on fire and moves that you never would have imagined being seen and called out beforehand in detail. You're going to see that. You're going to see me pushing the button too, folks, and I don't want you being lead into taking as a lot trade because even if you do make money, you're not learning from that as much as you painfully need more money like everybody else in the world.

### The Right Approach to Learning

You don't learn this by putting real money at risk because you're going to be worried about, "Am I going to be wrong this time? If it's moving a little bit, I'm trusting it. I've been here before, but it's retracing a little bit. Oh no, I can't. He's probably wrong. This is gonna be the time he's wrong. I should have never took this trade," and [you're] gonna close it. [It's] still going to go in your, in my favor, and you won't be in there, but you've taken a loss because you've got out while I was in a retracement above the entry or below the entry in deference to a long. That's why copying people is stupid. Copy me is dumb if you're going to try to trade. That's the stupidest thing in the world.

### Alternative: Following Signals

Now, if you don't want to learn how to trade because you know yourself better than anybody else would and you know you're not going to be disciplined and you just want to have someone that's skilled it provides signals to you, there's absolutely nothing wrong in that regard. There are people even in my community that are just like that. They just don't have the rule-based ideas that [give them] the discipline to maintain a rule-based strategy and say, "I'm not doing something right now because the rules say not to." They exist even in my community.

### Human Element and Personal Responsibility

Human beings are people that are spread across a diverse spectrum, and just because they are in my community, they hear the same videos and watch the same thing listening to me right now, it doesn't mean that they're going to be responsible. There's lots of irresponsible students of mine. They want to blame me for the things that they did when I had no business talking about anything for them to take a lot of trade, especially Forex, and they're taking trades in Forex, which I'm not touching on right now. "I took a trade because you told me." This is what happens. That's a trade that you took. You took [it]. Own it. You're gonna have to do that the rest of your life as a Trader. You can't fault to everybody else but you. When you do it wrong, own it. There's an opportunity to learn from that.

### Loving the Process: Key to Profitability

Love the fact of being in these charts. If you don't like watching real-time price action, back testing old price moves, and studying every small little detail about it, I'm going to tell you something. This is honest [to] God truth, and I I'm telling you there is no other way to describe it but this: If you don't love that part of this, you will not be profitable. You will fail. You will blow your account. You will fail your funded account challenge. You will fail to keep your funded account even if you got it. If you don't love this aspect of it, because that's what this is, folks, you got to look at these candlesticks and love it. You gotta love it. You can't stand weekends. You want to see these candles paint, and when they're not painting, you're [ __ ] miserable. That's just the way it is. That's what makes a Trader a Trader because if you don't have that level of passion, you will not endure losses if they're going to come.

### Embracing Uncertainty and Managing Risk

Even with my stuff, you're gonna lose. I lose. You're Gonna Lose. It's normal. It's a transaction cost in this business, and unfortunately, most people that come in here are not equipped to see the adversities that come with embracing uncertainty. A lot of folks can't do it. How do you know? How do you know? I've already taught you. I told you, but that won't suffice for some of you. You want to know where it won't ever hurt you or you won't ever take a loss. That doesn't exist. If you think that exists, get down here. Get out of here. Just go, just go. Don't even [be] watching videos. Perfect Trading, perfect never losing Trading, getting at the highest high and at the lowest low every single time, knowing every single move, being a part of every single move—nobody can do that for you.

### Real-Life Constraints and Realistic Expectations

You have to sleep. You're gonna get sick like I did last week. You're going to have a family to take care of like I do and like you do. Some of you have jobs still. Some of you run business, and some of you are in school. You can't be in every move. It's impossible. So how often are you looking at things unrealistically and pressuring yourself with things that don't need to be worried about? Those are not big stones. They're small little Pebbles that you easily just take your shoe off, drop the pillow out of your shoe, put your shoe back on and keep on walking forward. But many of you are just trying to do things well beyond what I'm outlining for you, expecting yourself to know how to do it too soon when I'm not expecting that, and I'm the instructor. It takes time. It takes time, and you have to allow your patients to form and build responsibility. And if you can't do that, it doesn't mean these Concepts fail or that they've changed the algorithm or it's become the new retail. It just means that you aren't ready. That's all.

### Focusing on One Model and Expanding Later

It took me years to get an understanding to know what it was I was looking for, and then even after that, I tinkered with it, which is why I told you earlier, once you find your model and you're comfortable with it, even though it doesn't deliver every single day for you, don't abandon it. Learn how to trade with that one model because it will teach you how to allow yourself to broaden your expectations and your understanding with other models that I teach and other tools. But you have to do one thing well. You just need one thing—buying a fair value gap, shorting a fair value gap, shorting a breaker, buying a breaker, aiming for buy stops or aiming for a premium fair value gap if you're long and reverse it for being bearish and short it. It's simple, folks. That stuff is simple. Just because I have a lot of tools and a lot of weapons in my repertoire and a lot of Concepts doesn't mean I'm bringing everything to every chart. You're only trading what's in the chart. That's it. If it's not in a chart, you're not referring to it, right?

### Simplicity and Focus on Current Conditions

So how hard is that? That's not complicated. But anyway, I gave you something real time. It panned out perfectly inside of a day that was already predetermined to be choppy and listless because of the FED chairman talking.

## Economic Calendar Awareness and Market Volatility

You have to know your economic calendar, folks, and then tomorrow is, you know, being Thursday, day before non-farm payroll Friday, and Friday being obviously NFP. It's a day where it's a Gamble, and they can take it anywhere they want, and I don't have tools that deliver a high degree of probability that I can trust because I think that they again those events are highly manipulated. That means there's manual intervention. Manual intervention ICT can't beat that, okay? I can't, and there's no shame in that.

### Strengths and Weaknesses of the ICT Methodology

You want to be told where the limits are, right? You would want to know I I would I would want to do that. What are the strengths of everything I talk about? How it's unrivaled, but what are the weaknesses? There are certain times of the month around certain calendar events that Precision will evade you. It doesn't matter how long you've been trading. It doesn't matter how good you think you are because I'm the author of this stuff, and I'm telling you Precision will escape you on these days over a large sample size. Once in a while, yes, I can get out there and call the low, trade the low, run up to near the high of the day on the mountain. I can do those things vice versa. So my students can do some of these things too, but does that mean it's a steady diet of every non-farm payroll? We can do that? No. Sometimes an iPhone payroll event is a mute point. It just doesn't do anything. It looks like this right here, a little bit of a squirrely move at 8:30 and it doesn't do anything.

### Perspective on Trading Days and Professional Conduct

In other days where it just really takes off and runs and runs and runs and runs and who cares if it does one day, isn't your career? One trading day does not and should not encapsulate your career, but you trade like it is every trade. It's a Make It or Break It. You got the Rocky theme playing. Come on, it's a trade. If you lose, who cares? If you win, who cares? You're indifferent to the outcome. That's how professional Traders conduct themselves. They don't care about the outcome. They're not over leveraging because they need a big Monumental win to share on social media to get their dopamine hit, their likes up. They're in this to make money consistently and manage risk. If they take a loss or series of losses, it's okay. It's part of it. They're not sharing it on social media so that way they can compound the pain and equally so [with wins].


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining all original details, context, and nuance while enhancing clarity and readability:

# Market Analysis: Algorithmic Price Delivery and Trading Insights (Continued)

## The Pitfalls of Social Media and Trading Performance

You're not sharing your winners so that way you can get a sugar high, because as soon as you do that, this is what's going to happen: yeah, man, that was amazing! Yeah, you're going to take the next trade, and that trade loses. Then you feel bad because you're like, "Oh, my sugar high's gone. Let me get it back," and it loses again. Now you were up four percent on the day, now you're down six. You ain't sharing that on social media, are you?

*   Don't provide yourself a means of being deflated by inviting social media to judge your performance.
*   It's personal.
*   It's absolutely personal.

If you're learning and you don't know how to trade, the worst thing you can do is share your results while you're learning.

*   You're not going to get the advice that you're hoping for.
*   You're not going to get the feel-good warm and fuzzies.
*   Somebody invariably is going to be jealous, and there's miserable creatures.
*   They're going to come up to your post, creep in there like a snake, and talk about how what you did was not good enough, it was stupid, that's nonsense, you got lucky.

They're never going to tell you what you think they should or what you walked under, just like your family isn't gonna. They're not going to understand what you're doing. They're not going to believe what you're doing can be profitable because they can't accept the fact that if you are, you're going to be doing better than them, and that's the way friends and family operate. They can tell you to your face they love you, but they love you only as long as you are just like them, and when you start crawling out of the depths of mediocrity, and they can start reflecting on how they've made mistakes and not really pursue anything in their own personal life and you're succeeding and they're still freaking lazy about doing anything about it, they're not going to cheer you on. Don't ask for outside cheerleaders. You need to be your own cheerleader, and that's done in your journal. Your trading journal that you're building this year, that's going to be the best damn trading book you've ever read in your life, and you wrote it yourself. This is going to have real experiences that you were there. You back tested that. You watched that live session. You called that move. You saw it and eventually later in half a year, you'll be paper trading it that way you'll have a real engagement with it, that's encouraging, that's the stuff that you want to build yourself up with, things that you had your hands all over, not let me borrow this guy's momentum and copy his trades and if he makes money I make money and I can feel like I'm a good Trader. That's not, that's not Trading. I'm sorry. That's not Trading. That's mimicking, and I have a disdain for that. I can't stand it because to me, it makes no sense why anybody wouldn't just go through the struggle, because it is, to learn this, whether you learn from me or somebody else. I mean, it's hard. You have to look at yourself through a mirror that these markets will provide for you, and you're going to discover that you aren't the person you thought you were.

*   You're gonna have character flaws that are absolutely shocking to you.
*   You're not as patient as you thought you were.
*   You're not so disciplined as you thought you would be.

And that provides opportunity for you to improve upon and build yourself up a consistently profitable Trader.

## The Potential Consequences of Trading Success

Let me explain something to you in closing: one of two things is going to happen. You're going to do very, very well this year in learning how to reprice, and that is going to result in one of two things.

1.  You're going to turn into the biggest prick that you could ever imagine because you're gonna you're gonna have a skill set that you can literally sit down any given day of the week go in there and make what you make a month in a trade and you're gonna know that you can do that any [ __ ] day you want to.
    *   That is power.
    *   That's power that brings a level of confidence that you can't even understand right now.
2.  Conversely, there's going to be the other half of you that's going to learn this, have that same aptitude, that same skill set, and you're going to think to yourself, wow, what a wonderfully blessed position I'm in right now.
    *   I am so thankful that I have this skill set right now that I can not only impact my own life, my personal family's life, maybe even a friend or a stranger, and you're going to conduct yourself in a manner that isn't ugly, that people aren't going to look at you and say, wow, you're an arrogant douchebag, even if you are good at Trading.
    *   They won't have anything bad to say about you because you're not conducting yourself in a manner that draws attention to yourself like you're some kind of [ __ ] hero.

That's the problem in this industry, okay? That's we need less of that, and I'm hoping that what I'm creating with all of you, yes, you're gonna be monsters, you're going to be Savages in the charts in your trading, yes, I don't want you to be a social media douchebag. A lot of men can't wait to do it, but that would be an embarrassment to me because I did that stuff, and it's embarrassing. It's shameful, and you're not going to win the majority of the the community doing that. You might have some young hot shots that want to be just like you because they think that that's strength, that's influence, that's power, that's clout, when really in all honesty, it's [ __ ], it's all it is, it's trash, it's trashy. It nobody really has any respect for anybody like that, and if anybody does, it's fainted, it's it's fake it's it's because they want to try to get something from you, and once they get whatever they want to try to get from you, they're not going to worship you, and nobody should be working should be anyone, and I'm on the top of that list.

## Avoiding the Pitfalls of Ego and New Money

So this skill set you're learning this year, don't try to Aspire to be some kind of egomaniac.

*   It's gonna be hard for some of you, really, really hard, because you're going to find a skill set that number one, you didn't know existed, and you're going to be able to have the ability to make money that you've never seen before, and it's going to make you feel like you're something that you really aren't because you are growing into new money, and that was an experience I went through when I was a younger man.
*   New money makes you think that you're better than you really are in all aspects, and it makes you a very toxic, ugly person, but you won't see it that way.
*   You're going to think that I should be arrogant. I'm Justified. Look at all the things I can do now. Look at the money I can make. I'm better than that guy and that guy that guy that shouldn't be your motivation.

It wasn't my motivation initially, but when I found success, it made me think that way because I was a weak young man constantly seeking validation, and as a 50 year old man, I still seek validation because I can't get it from a family member that's passed away before seeing where I am today, so it aches in me. So if you never start it, you won't fall victim to being drawn back into it again because the public isn't going to give you what you think you think they're going to worship you and lift you up on a pedestal. That's so short-term, and it's not even worth it. Living your life principally oriented, Purpose Driven, trying to make a positive impact on other people's lives, not trying to [ __ ] all over them because you think you're better than everybody else.

## The Importance of Humility and Helping Others

If you if you see anything in me, you understand this: I am absolutely convinced that there is not a one single Trader on this planet that can do this better than me, but in that same sentence because I know that doesn't give me the right to talk down and [ __ ] on everybody else. I'm giving you my time. I'm giving you my life's work because I want to help you. I want to see you do well. I want to see what you'll do with it, and I know just like I've been talking about the last couple of minutes, some of you are going to abuse that power, and you're going to regret it later in life like I did because you acted like a fool because you wanted to be significant. The significance is helping other people, helping other people be better than where they are now, and that feels way better than anybody saying you're the goat dude, you're the goat man. I ain't no [ __ ] goat, don't call me a goat, that pisses me off, okay? I can't stand that. I'm not the king, I'm not the goat, I'm not the greatest of all times, I'm **ICT** or Michael, that's it. Got a lot of people out there want to be called The Goat, and they don't have the accolades to justify it.

## Contentment in Trading and Market Analysis

So with that, hope you got something out of this today. Probably didn't work too much of uh hole in your attention span. I'm sure some of you already logged off thinking look at this guys can spray a little in but the market ain't moving, but it did what we were looking for is small as surgical as that was, that's all that was necessary for today, and when it does it, you stop. You move to the sidelines that be content even in your studies be content with that close your charts annotate them and think to yourself, wow, we had a laboratory experiment today we watched live price action it behaved in a manner that was reasonable it was expected it made perfect sense and now that it's done it it's right back inside the range where everybody else is trying to figure out what it's going to do next when you don't need to worry about it, isn't that power, doesn't that give you a sense of calmness. There's no necessity for you to know what it's going to do next because the profile of this day indicates that it's 50 50.

*   So if it's 50 50 is that probably it's a high probability?
*   No, you're trying to gamble.
*   You want to have a move it needs to be doing something because you are in front of the charts it owes you something.

No, turn your charts off. Go do something else. Be content even if it moves a lot from where we are right now, who cares? Go back in tomorrow.

## Upcoming Schedule and Final Remarks

I won't be live streaming tomorrow, and I won't be live streaming on Friday. I will be doing video work so that way I can catch up that the lectures because I'm I've been doing these live streams pouring in to you through that, but I want to do pre-recorded lectures too, so I want to get back to doing that and populate the channel for the 2023 mentorship lessons and such. So that's what I'll be doing over the next couple days and also doing some interviews with some of the profitable students. So I will bid you a farewell have yourself a very pleasant afternoon evening whatever you are and until talk to you next time be safe.

# **ICT New Week Opening Gap (NWOG) Explained**

**Video URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKnlIIkBTk

## **Introduction to the New Week Opening Gap (NWOG)**

This lecture focuses on the **ICT New Week Opening Gap (NWOG)**, a concept introduced on Twitter in **February 2023**.

### **Locating the NWOG**

*   To locate the NWOG, use a lower time frame chart (e.g., **1-minute or 5-minute chart**). Avoid using daily charts due to potential settlement price discrepancies.
*   Identify **Sunday's opening price** and **the previous Friday's closing price**.
*   The NWOG is the gap or difference between these two price points.

### **Example: February 5th, 2023**

The speaker provides the following real example:

*   **Date:** Sunday, February 5th, 2023.
*   **Method:** Locate the Sunday opening price and the Friday closing price.
*   **Analysis:** The midpoint between these two price points represents **consequent encroachment**.

### **Example: February 12th, 2023**

*   **Date:** Sunday, February 12th, 2023.
*   Similar to the previous example, find the closing price on Friday and the opening price on Sunday. The difference between them marks the NWOG.
*   The midpoint between those two price points is consequent encroachment.

## **Purpose and Application of the NWOG**

### **Fair Value Identification**

The ICT New Week Opening Gap serves as a tool to identify **large fund fair value**. The speaker utilizes this to identify fair market value in the market.

### **Algorithmic Significance**

*   Algorithms frequently refer back to old NWOGs as points of **fair value**.
*   This is comparable to how algorithms revisit old inefficiencies and liquidity voids.
*   Unlike many traders who discard filled gaps, these NWOGs remain relevant.

### **Liquidity Void Definition**

*   A "real" liquidity void represents an absence of buying and selling between two specific price points.
*   In the context of NWOG, this refers to the gap between **Friday's close** and **Sunday's open**, where no trading occurred.
*   Algorithms can revisit these gaps weeks or even months after their initial formation.

### **Chart Setup**

*   The speaker keeps a minimum of **four to five weeks** worth of NWOGs on their chart.
*   Having at least **four** new week opening gaps on your chart for proper perspective of large fund Fair valuation
*   The speaker likes to have **five** because it keeps a kind of like a a dynamic four months perspective.

## **Detailed Chart Analysis: February 19th, 2023 Example**

### **Date Reference**

*   The speaker uses **February 19th, 2023** as an example, using a **1-minute chart**.

### **Candlestick Notation**

*   **Green candles:** Bullish (up close).
*   **Black candles:** Bearish (down close).

### **NWOG Identification**

*   The speaker identifies the closing price on Friday and the opening price on Sunday, noting the price difference.
*   While price may initially trade back into the gap, the NWOG's significance isn't diminished.

### **Annotation Technique**

*   The speaker annotates Friday's closing price and Sunday's opening price using a **ray**. This is like a short trend line that anchors to one specific price point and projects to the right.
*   **Friday close:** 4:59 PM Eastern Standard Time (East Coast US time).
*   **Sunday open:** 6:00 PM Eastern Standard Time.
*   This highlights the basic NWOG.

### **Fibonacci Application**

*   A **Fibonacci** tool is anchored to Friday's closing price.
*   If Sunday's opening price is lower, the Fibonacci is dragged down to that level.
*   The **50% level** on the Fibonacci represents **consequent encroachment** within the gap.

### **Dressed NWOG**

*   A fully "dressed" NWOG includes the high, the low, and the consequent encroachment (50% level).
*   The speaker notes that for an order block, the 50% level would be the mean threshold instead of consequent encroachment.

### **Annotation Labeling Suggestions**

*   To maintain clear records, annotate NWOGs with the **Sunday date**. This prevents confusion as you accumulate multiple NWOGs on your chart.
*   Another option is to use the Friday date for the upper level annotation and the Sunday date for the lower level. However, the speaker finds labeling the Sunday date works better.
*   The speaker prefers to write notes on a physical notepad, but these suggestions offer organizational strategies for charts.
*   Fully label the NWOG with the relevant Sunday date (e.g., "Sunday, February 19, 2023 NWOG").

## **Additional Examples & Enhancements**

### **February 26th, 2023 NWOG**

*   The example includes Friday's closing price, Sunday's opening price, and the 50% consequent encroachment level.

### **Quadrants**

*   Further refine NWOG analysis by dividing the gap into **quadrants**.
*   Calculate the midpoint between the high and the 50% level (upper third).
*   Calculate the midpoint between the 50% level and the low (lower quadrant).
*   The speaker prefers a cleaner chart, visualizing these midpoints without adding additional lines.

### **March 5th, 2023 NWOG**

*   This example covers Friday's closing price, Sunday's opening price, and the resulting consequent encroachment.

## **NWOG Chart Application and Interpretation**

### **Support and Resistance**

*   The chart demonstrates how price interacts with old NWOGs, often treating them as **support and resistance levels**.
*   Having at least **four**, preferably **five**, NWOGs on the chart provides a rolling 30-day (approximately one month) perspective.
*   There's no specific limit to the number of NWOGs you can keep, but the speaker finds four or five optimal.

### **Fair Value Reference**

*   NWOGs serve as references for **real fund level valuation** and **fair value**.
*   The market tends to move between these levels.

### **Rangebound vs. Trending Markets**

*   A **vertical line** delineates the gap for each week.
*   The examples illustrate how prices can act as resistance, consolidate, and find support at these levels.
*   **Rangebound/consolidation** occurs when price has difficulty moving away from the NWOG.
*   **Trending/Expansion** occurs when price leaves the NWOG and doesn't return.

### **Observation and Analysis**

*   Reviewing the chart reveals how price often gravitates back to previous NWOGs.
*   It's crucial to retain this historical data on your chart as a template.

## **Template Management**

### **Asset Specific Templates**

*   The speaker maintains separate chart templates for Nasdaq, ES, Dow, Dollar, and Forex pairs (EUR/USD and GBP/USD).

### **Real-Time Updates**

*   On Fridays, after market close, place a ray/trendline at the closing price.
*   On Sundays, mark the opening price and measure the difference to find consequent encroachment.
*   Update the template and save it.

## **Homework Assignment: Actual vs. Theoretical NWOG**

### **NWOG Actual**

*   The speaker uses a template labeled: new week opening Gap and hyphen actual
*   The speaker defines this as the actual opening on Sunday

### **NWOG Theoretical**

*   The homework assignment involves calculating a "theoretical" NWOG.
*   Use the **Friday closing price at 4:59 PM** and the **Monday opening price at 9:30 AM** (for ES).
*   This approach excludes Sunday's trading activity.

### **Template Creation**

*   Create two templates:
    *   One using the **actual Sunday opening** (**NWOG Actual**).
    *   One using the **Monday 9:30 AM opening** (**NWOG Theoretical**).
*   Compare the NWOGs generated by these two methods.

### **Comparative Analysis**

*   Analyze how fair valuation is utilized throughout the week using both templates.
*   Monitor these NWOGs over a period of at least a month.

## **Conclusion**

The speaker concludes by encouraging viewers to apply these concepts to their charts and wishes them well.

### Trading Demonstration: Drawing Down and Swing Projection

**Video URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlbQ-Z88NsI

**Creating Drawdown (Short Positions)**

Okay, so, the strategy here involves creating some drawdown. I'm going to paint some shorts in here to try and build the position. The idea is that when it stops me out, it'll only take a little bit of equity away. This week's homework was focused on simulating drawdown on a well-known funded account challenge, specifically addressing the parameters they impose.

*   **Stop Out Strategy:** The exercise demonstrates how to manage potential losses.
*   **Adding Additional Shorts:** I'm adding another short here, again, just to draw down further.

**Example of a Five Handle Run**

Now, I'm short here. This will be an example of a five-handle run, but I'm *not* going to close it. I'm going to let it come back on me. That right there would be a five handle run. We'll be content with that move.

**Awaiting Unemployment Data**

Moving to the sidelines now in anticipation of unemployment data release. It's going to railroad this position. Okay, so there's the run out.

**Switching to Long Position and Swing Projection**

Now, I'm going to look at the daily chart. The reason is to expect it to go higher. So, I'm going to go long here and I'll do a swing projection to give me my target.

*   **Building Position:** Just adding, building in my position on that order block.

**Maximum Parameter and Target Hit**

I'm currently at the maximum parameter I specified: 15 contracts. That's what the funded account challenge allows if you're using the **150,000 option** – you can't go beyond that. We're about to run up here and hit that target... and there it is!

# Trading Analysis: Mitigation Block Strategy

This analysis focuses on a long position taken on a mitigation block, specifically utilizing an up-close candle during consolidation.

## Initial Setup and Context

*   **Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPKUqW\_eaas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPKUqW_eaas)
*   The trade was executed on a Thursday, specifically a **non-farm payroll** Thursday.
*   The morning session's **opening range gap** was annotated.
*   The environment included background ambiance: "*you can hear all the Ambiance my wife is behind me making breakfast*".
*   The trader entered a **long position** within a **fair value gap (FVG)**.
*   The target was the **new week opening gap**.

## Trade Execution and Rationale

*   Positive feedback was observed as the price returned into the fair value gap (FVG).
*   Trade precision is noted to be less "pristine" compared to other days, given it was a non-farm payroll Thursday.
*   A stop loss was placed close to the entry point.
*   The rationale for the stop loss placement stemmed from observing:

    *   A **buy-side inefficiency** that the trader wanted to see left open.
    *   A preference for seeing **large green candles to the upside**.
*   The initial target was a **swing projection target**.

## Partial Exits and Risk Management

*   Five contracts were initially taken off at the **swing projection target**, utilizing a "maximum funded" approach.
*   The account has a **15-contract maximum** for an **$850,000 account**.
*   The trader is aiming to demonstrate:

    *   Drawdown management
    *   Mitigation strategies
    *   Raw profit potential
*   After the first partial profit was secured:

    *   The stop loss was rolled to **better than even** (breakeven or a slight profit).
    *   The limit order was adjusted towards the **top end of the new week opening gap**.

## Final Result

*   Partials were taken as the price entered the **new week opening gap**.
*   One contract remained, aiming for a run to the limit.
*   The final target was hit: "*and there's the results with the drawdown*".

# Pushing the Button: Overcoming Fear in Trading

**Video URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ379EuyNKQ

## Introduction: Setting the Stage

Good morning folks, good morning guys.  Let me know on Twitter if the audio and volume are okay and if you can see the ES chart. Thank you, Leon, for confirming the volume is good. I can't improve it further; my microphone volume is maxed out, and I'm practically kissing the mic, so that's where we're at.

Today, we tackle a topic many have been eagerly awaiting: **pushing the button**.  Given tomorrow's **FOMC** announcement, expect a slow trading session.  Many are waiting to see what the Fed will do, making their predictions. I, personally, don't forecast the Fed's actions.  I think anyone who tries is fooling themselves, or attempting to.

## Initial Market Assessment: A Relaxed Approach

While awaiting the morning session's opening range completion (typically 9:30 to 10:00 AM), we'll maintain a relaxed view. I'm not starting with a rigid bias.  I prefer to let the market reveal its intentions. We're seeking a small opportunity for what I teach as a **low threshold objective: five handles in the ES**.

Later this year, you'll see me pursue larger moves (20, 30, 40, 50 handles), but today isn't one of those days.  I want to emphasize how I teach students to start: with a **low-hanging fruit objective.**

### Core Principles: Patience and High Probability

I believe that this mindset is ideal for studying; focus on:

*   Not trying to get rich overnight.
*   Not trying to get rich at all, really.
*   Carving out a repeatable opportunity you're comfortable with.
*   Being patient, looking for that opportunity.
*   Allowing the market to present advantageous signatures, warranting a high-probability price move (as I define it).

### Commitment and Disclaimer: Managing Expectations

I'm willing to dedicate more time than usual this morning, aiming to stay until we find a qualifying opportunity. I'll share the rationale behind my expectations.

**IMPORTANT:** This is **not a signal service**. (The disclaimer will appear periodically.)  This is not an invitation to copy trades, fix drawdowns, or pass a funded account challenge.  I'll provide exercises and share my market expectations, but I strongly encourage using your **demo account.**  If you're trading with a live account based on what I say today, you're doing it wrong and will regret it.

## Teaching My Son: Addressing Fear and Uncertainty

I'm teaching my son, who's embarking on a funded account challenge (I won't name the company). He wants to earn it, not receive money from me. As a novice, he fears getting in. I had similar anxieties in the 90s when starting with commodities.

### Overcoming Initial Anxiety: Focus on the Process

If you're new to the markets, or even ICT content, it can be bewildering. You may have questions like:

*   What timeframe should I use?
*   What market should I trade?
*   What setup am I looking for?

My teaching presents various approaches to "skinning the cat," allowing for personalization. Today, I'll force a specific entry approach, utilizing a fair value gap – something visually easy to spot, similar to equal lows targeted for sell-side liquidity or equal highs as a draw for buy-side liquidity. These are generic and obvious.

### Limiting Perspective: Simulating a Novice Trader

I'm submitting to not looking at anything this morning because I want to present the opportunity in the closest manner to someone that doesn't know what I'm teaching.

I'm limiting my perspective to just this five minute chart. Now you don't want to be doing this obviously the market just opened up by the way, you don't want to do this if you're trying to trade with real funds but try trying to pantomime as close as I can to someone that would have a limited perspective which is someone that doesn't look at higher time frame charts someone that doesn't look at you know much of anything except for the chart they're looking at at the time and usually it's a one minute chart or five minute chart because me and other people on the internet have showcased the opportunities that we're presenting on those time frames so therefore the audience members will gravitate to those time frames thinking that that's the only way to do it when it's not it's just it's a good teaching medium for me because it gives lots of opportunity plus it gives no room for any delay like it's right there on the on the Fly

### Focusing on the Five-Minute Chart: Understanding Market Gaps

And this five minute chart may not be the time frame I'm going to use on. I pulled that up to show the Monday closing regular session price which is that 39.84.

Sticking to this timeframe, we're opening with a **premium**, meaning a gap from yesterday's close. If you go to your regular trading hours tab, you click on that, there's the Gap we're looking at here okay so it's a very significant Gap whenever it's like that I like to see a little bit of a move to the upside to draw in the public make them want to chase it and then typically what it'll generally do not all the time but generally it'll want to move back down inside of that range and what range am I really really speaking about let's outline that now so using the regular session close price here up to the opening price this morning so that Gap which is significant going into this morning I want you to focus on the potential for just trading back into that range that's shaded here.

We're not trying to make the case that it's going to trade all the way back down to 39 84.50 that's not an argument I'm trying to pose to you what I'm suggesting is can we see a five handle price run from wherever we trade up to and I'm not trying to pick the top I'm going to let the market indicate that it's stopped at least for the short term going higher I'm not trying to go long I'm going to try to look for something that gets into that range here so I'm giving you a directional bias that I'm looking to operate in doesn't mean that it can't go higher doesn't mean it can't go down to the the previous session closing price we're not trying to forecast that remember the argument here is how does one conquer fear of getting in how do you conquer that and you probably had anxiety especially if you got lucky enough to get a funded account where you've passed the challenge and now they give you the funded account and then suddenly you're you're met with this new anxiety this new let me go back to the electronic session now just be mindful that this shaded area here that's our opening range Gap so where we closed yesterday or previous day to where we open that's what's being highlighted there okay so I'm going to drop down into the electronic trading hours that shaded area is what we're representing there

## Reflecting on Initial Trading Experiences: Fear and Overthinking

When I started in 1992, I rushed to open an account, then froze with fear. Everything on the chart seemed like Greek. I was afraid of being wrong, taking a loss, or doing it incorrectly. I kept it secret.

### Personal Anecdote: A Cautionary Tale

I opened a trading account with Fox Investments paying 100 dollars per round turn per contract yes it was robbery but that's what we were told that was the normal back then so a discount broker was like Lynn walldock where you paid 30 some dollars per contract so I was fearful much much in in the vein that most of you would have doing it wrong but I was also afraid of because I only had twenty five hundred dollars in the account which was extremely under capitalized like I didn't have enough money so what I was thinking was not only do I have to be right about my trade but I also have to be right about my entry not going into too much drawdown because as soon as I put the trade on they're going to do what they're going to take that commission right out of that so I got to cover a hundred dollars right away so if I'm trading the grain market like soybeans I have to have at least two cents of a move because each penny move is 50 Cent I'm sorry fifty dollars much like a es mini contract so I I was already overthinking everything and that anxiety caused me to be much like a deer in headlights

### Reinforcing the Purpose: Teaching, Not Signaling

Let me also talk about you know real quick this this is about teaching you how to overcome fear it's not about teaching you to follow me and uses as signals because I know some of you are here just for that very reason if you're not listening to what I'm teaching it's not going to be beneficial to you I could get out here and push the button to me right all day long but it's not making you better it's not teaching you how to do it on your own which is really what I'm trying to do here it's the only reason why I'm even doing live streams is to show you how to do it and my son who's hopefully going to learn from this and he wasn't privy to all this stuff that I'm talking about now because he wasn't interested in trading he's typical teenage kid video games in in high school Antics that kids do but my concern much like all of yours if you've ever experienced fear and some of you probably are fearful doing it wrong even in a demo account I've had many people reach out to me that they have ruined several demo accounts not knowing what they're doing and it is so frustrating they can't even get to the point where they can push a button there which is Extreme anxiety but you're placing too much emphasis on the outcome being perfect for you in the beginning as I'll show you today you want to exercise and do drills and I'm going to teach you how to cope with the initial fear of getting into a market move and not worrying about that outcome being profitable now before I close the session obviously my goal is to find something that moves five handles that's that's obviously the intention today but I'm also going to present opportunities where I want you to think about what you're being shown in the chart I'm going to point to something and ask you that conceptualize what it is I'm pointing at and does it make sense to utilize that as an entry versus the ones that you'll actually see me push the button on now it's a it's a skill set that you'll obviously learn over time but you can't just expect with a live account whether it be a funded account or your actual funds in a traditional broker you can't expect those types of conditions just to materialize magic and all of a sudden now you know how to trade because you're using real money now which is the reason why I'm an opponent to anyone teaching that people should just learn how to trade with real money you don't learn how to trade with real money you learn how to engaged risk where you didn't have that before in paper trading and demetrating but you learned how to trade with a demo that's what a demo does the demo is not just to familiarize yourself with a platform or a broker it's absolutely to teach you how to trade and anyone that says otherwise is this a fool and this is the book that's the bottom line

## Analyzing Current Market Conditions: Dollar Index and ES

We're looking at a market that has a little bit of a mixed bag this morning much like we had yesterday I was calling most of everything you saw yesterday yes on my Twitter feed so you can go back and take a look at that but today we have the dollar Index it's come off of its lows from 9 30 back into the range that was formed from 9 15 to 9 30. I'd like to see it mount a run above you're welcome to check your charts I don't want to toggle too much and make the mistake of losing audio the high of 103 13. I want to see it uh trade above that that would indicate there's likeliness to see the Shaded area on ES be Revisited and again we're just looking for an opportunity to frame a five handle run which is not a lot and right away you should be thinking how much could I be risking with that well when you first encounter doing entry drills where you're practicing with your demo account with your paper trading account which is how you do this you're using one contract now I know somebody got there that are trying to make a name for yourself trolling and making up a bunch of nonsense you're going to be out there and you're going to say but I trade 40 contracts and 30 contracts and blow my account out in front of everybody on live streams and pretend it doesn't happen what we're doing is trying to teach you how to overcome the fear that fear that anxiety is rooted in number one The Leverage right away the easiest thing to do to remove fear or to squash it and any anxiety is to remove the Leverage dial that back just because your funded account says you can trade with 15 contracts that's not an invitation for you as my student to think that that's appropriate that's a that's a lot of risk for someone that's just now getting a funded account I mean you're you're new you don't have the experience you have no idea what it feels like to watch an account balance fluctuate with that measure of capital on each point fluctuation so you want to start with one contract and you want to desensitize yourself because that same five pip handle or something a five point run in es you can do

## Pushing the Button: Overcoming Fear in Trading (Continued)

### Managing Risk and Leverage: A Gradual Approach

Over time, with experience, you can graduate to trading with **two contracts, three contracts, four contracts**, or even opt into the **15 contracts per trade** that your funded account allows. This gradual approach allows you to gain experience with price action associated with real monetary loss and potential gain.

You can't simply plunge into the maximum number of contracts allowed right away. When teaching predominantly the Forex markets, I've mentioned many times that just because you *can* leverage to the maximum with a broker doesn't mean you *should*. Doing so increases the likelihood of blowing your account, losing money, and being fearful in the marketplace.

### Cultivating a Boring Approach: Removing Emotion

You want trading to be very boring. Remove emotion, excitement, and fanfare. With these distractions gone, your attention will be on price action, not on how much you can make or worrying about how much you're going to lose.

Unfortunately, most new traders want to gamble, like playing the lottery, hoping their bet works out in their favor. If they just use very little risk, they can take lots of trades and still stay in the game long enough to get the eventual outcome they're looking for. Avoid trying to get rich overnight.

### Current Market Analysis: ES, NASDAQ, Dow, and Dollar Index

So far, we're just marking time on **ES**. It hasn't done too much of anything. I'm looking at the **NASDAQ**, and it's not doing much either, but the **Dow** is certainly weaker. It's coming off of its run higher posted this morning.

I'm watching a **volume imbalance at 103.06 on the one-minute chart of the Dollar Index**. I want to see it respect that level and continue pressing to **103.13**. A rally higher in the dollar would be risk-off near term, meaning that it's easier for foreign currencies like British pound versus US dollar, Dow, NASDAQ, and ES to trade softer or go lower.

This doesn't mean I'm picking the top or that it's going to crash. It simply puts things in motion that would likely support weaker, lower prices. We've already gapped higher and had that initial move higher. Traders who bought the breakout are already in the trade.

### Shifting Timeframes: From Five-Minute to One-Minute Chart

I'm going to drop down into a one-minute chart now, going through four, three, two, and one-minute charts.

### The 30-Minute Rule: Patience and Avoiding False Moves

The exercise I'm teaching today involves waiting for an opportunity. Remember, in the first 30 minutes of trading ES, you want to be willing to submit to the market. While you can find a setup if it's obvious, as a general rule of thumb, you want to wait out that initial period. Sometimes, reports come out at 9:45 AM (though not today or every day). Also, the initial move right off the opening is generally not the right one to be placing yourself in front of risk. It could be a Judas swing or a fake move.

We want to allow the marketplace to draw in the gamblers who want to trade in the first couple of minutes. Relax, slow down, and remind yourself that you have plenty of time, the entire day, to find these measly little five handles. Don't rush simply to get it out of the way.

### Overcoming Anxiety: Avoiding the "Get In and Get Out" Mentality

You're going to feel like you need to trade, and you're also initially anxious about doing it incorrectly. You're going to feel like you need to get in there, get your money, and run away. However, you're conditioning yourself to hate trading. I went through a phase like that after blowing a few accounts in the 90s. That feeling of wanting to get in, get my money, and run away conditioned me to be afraid of it, making it almost impossible to grind through to a point of not being fearful.

### Building Trust Through Multiple Execution Models

That's why I have so many execution models that let me get into a trade and participate in a move. The reason why I have so many weapons like that is because one of my strongest barriers was being afraid to enter because I didn't trust the model I was working with. I didn't have enough experience seeing it work, and I was in a hurry just because I saw a few of them work.

### Learning from Mistakes: Don't Block Out the Losses

When you do these exercises and drills, don't block out the times you do it wrong. Make sure you learn what you did incorrectly in those instances. If you don't address the issues, they're going to repeat. If you're trading with live funds, eventually, it's going to wear down your equity or mental capital, and you will blow your account.

**Preservation of capital** is the first and foremost important rule in speculation, whether you're doing it with paper trading, demo, or eventually in live funds.

### Current Market Update: Dollar Index and ES

Again, we're submitting to that first 30 minutes. Nothing's happened so far today. The dollar is firming up but hasn't gotten above that **103.13** level, which is what I'm looking for.

### Identifying Potential Setups: Clean Lows and Sell-Side Liquidity

Now we're seeing some weakness. Right away, your eye should jump to these **clean lows**. See that right there? What's resting below those lows? **Sell-side liquidity**. We had a displacement below this low, and we're trading back up into the imbalance.

The risk would have to be at the swing high of **4025.75**. Does this area offer an opportunity to see five handles to that level? Yes.

### Analyzing Market Dynamics: Dollar Index and ES Correlation

As I'm watching ES, I want to see it drop below, trade back inside the shaded area, and gravitate towards the sell-side liquidity. I'm watching the Dollar Index. There's a small little imbalance that's trading on. It's the **9:44 big green candle on the one-minute chart**. I'm watching to see if it respects that, in other words, does it want to send the dollar higher while I'm watching ES?

### The 5 for 5 Drill: Risk-Reward Ratio

The initial drill is **five for five**, meaning you're going to risk five handles to make five handles. I already know there will be individuals thinking that it doesn't make money, but it does. You don't need a high rate of multiples to be profitable. If you have a strike rate that's pretty high, you can do one for one. While you're training yourself, you don't need a high multiple because you're conditioning yourself to get over that fear of missing a trade.

### Real-Time Market Observation: Dollar Index and ES

This in here is not as clean as I would like to have seen it. I would have rather not seen that little move here, but I'm giving it an opportunity to see if I can see that run up on the dollar on that small little buy-side/sell-side inefficiency. Again, we're still in that first 30 minutes of trading.

This is all part of that process: *What are you looking for, ICT? What are you waiting for? What do you look to see? What do you want to find in price action? What is your focus? What don't you like?*

This is how you mentor someone. It's just not blindly going in there and taking a trade.

### Alternative Scenario: Trading Consequent Encroachment

Let's say this starts to break lower, and I haven't gotten in yet. I can use the top of that shaded area and the midpoint of this wick (which would be **consequent encroachment**). In other words, if it traded down here but didn't trade below here yet and traded back up into it, I don't have a problem with that as an entry.

You might not be comfortable with something like that. I'm not trying to convince you that that's the model for you. I'm simply illustrating how to overcome the fear of entry, which is the whole topic of the day.

### Forcing a Focus: Fair Value Gaps

I'm wanting to trade with an entry with a fair value gap. At some point, it's going to give it to me. I just have to wait long enough for it to happen. It's going to happen every day, but you don't have the patience if you're new to wait for it.

Since we have nothing here, I didn't go short. Why? Because there's no fair value gap. I wanted to see a small portion of that down-closed candle left open, then a new candle start, and then it trade up into that. Then I would have sold short right there, targeting these lows. If I don't have what I'm looking for in a chart, I'm not just going to think, "Well, I have video games to play," or "I have to do something here," or "My wife's going to be asking me to do something, and I won't be able to be in front of my charts."

### Monitoring Intermarket Relationships: Dollar Index, ES, and NASDAQ

The Dollar Index did not respect that fair value gap, which is what I was watching for. It went a little bit deeper than I wanted to see, but it does have a wick. If you look at the wick on the candle of the one-minute chart for DXY (the 9:43 low), we've just dropped down into that. I'm trying to watch and see if we get some kind of respect there and go higher, but I don't like where we are with ES. We might need to go one more time higher on ES. NASDAQ looks like it wants to flirt with a higher high also, but the Dow is just a dog right now.

### Market Divergence: Dow, NASDAQ, and ES

The Dow on the one-minute chart looks sloppier than the NASDAQ and ES.

On NASDAQ, we have relative equal highs, and it looks like we could run up and hit that. On ES, we also have relative equal highs and a small little gap. If we trade it down there to 23 to 28, that would be five handles. The dollar is just hanging around, still not confirming or denying anything.

### The Psychological Struggle: Impatience and Fear

This is the time that is excruciating for inexperienced traders. You feel like you showed up, you're here, and ICT said he's going to push the button today, and you're ready. You're chomping at the bit, and that's exactly how it feels when you get in front of a chart when you have live funds at your disposal. You want to do something, but you're also scared: *What if I do it wrong?* Everything's a second guess, and you're in a hurry just to get in and do something.

That's the trap. You have to still remember what you learned about trading in a demo. You have to remember those lessons. You have to go back on that experience because if you don't refer to that or even have gained any of that experience, you're going to be impulsively pressing the button.

There has to be something in the chart to justify an entry. You can't just gamble and see what happens.

### Waiting for the Right Setup: The Importance of Discipline

We're saying that it can go up to that 4028 level. I'm not interested in taking that, but that's a move I think is likely. I want to use a fair value gap today. That's my focus. I'm confident it'll form. I'm just trying to exercise discipline to show you what it's like to sit through all the other price action moves.

I don't care who's making money on YouTube. I don't care how many people are posting things on Twitter. That's not my trade. That's not your trade. You can't go back in time and enter when they did, if it was even profitable at all.

You have to submit yourself to this process of learning.

### Post-Gap Market Dynamics: Analyzing Potential Short Squeezes

So now think about what's actually occurring here. The market gapped up at the open, had a small rally higher, and we've dropped, but we haven't dropped aggressively. The only thing we had here was this drop down here, and it quickly canceled out any short opportunity due to the relationships of intermarket analysis with the dollar. Go back and listen to the recording if you missed it.

So in my mind, I'm thinking anyone that's already trying to sell short the gap higher in the initial high that's been formed here gets killed by this run.

Now I'm watching very closely: *How does that Dollar Index go back to that original fair value gap?* I mean the one at the candle at 9:44 one-minute Dollar Index. If we rally here because we cut through candles (we're not supplying demand; we cut through the candles that have been formed over the last seven or eight candles), we go back to that fair value gap. The candle we're in right now basically has already traded down into that low of that fair value gap.

I want to see: Does it rally higher on the dollar? If that does, this high here on ES could be suspect, meaning that it's just a run on buy stops or anyone short, and then we could look to see it trade into that 4020 or lower, but it has to do so in price. All we're doing is anticipating the likelihood of that right now.

### Intermarket Analysis: Euro, Pound, and Dollar Index

My intention is going through euro dollar. I'm looking at euro, the pound dollar, the Dollar Index, and trying to get a measure for where risk is (is it risk-on or risk-off?). Euro is just consolidating. It hasn't really done much since around 7:30 AM.

Dollar, like I said, has come off its lows at 103, and I'm still looking for that 103.13 to be broken to the upside. How we trade there hasn't gone below on Dollar Index hasn't gone lower than the low formed at 9:54 (154 is low), and now we have ES coming back down below these highs here. The dollar is looking favorable now.

## Market Analysis and Trading Strategy: A Detailed Breakdown

### Anticipating Market Movements: Fair Value Gaps and Highs

What we're going to do is wait to see if this **high** stays in place. If we break lower and create a **fair value gap** in here, between this low and the high that's formed, we're using that price leg there. So, inside of this range, this is protraction. It's done what is taken by side here with this rally up. So, inside of this price leg, we are anticipating now a fair value at the form.

If it can form, I'll use that one. Excuse me, I'll use that one to try to get a run for five handles. Now, I don't want it to go too fast from here. Brett's like, "ICT is trying to trade it, don't give it to him, reprice it lower, no fair value gap." He's going to convince everybody today you can't do it all day, and I'll stay here long enough to do it.

### Turtle Soup Scenario: Divergence and Market Behavior

You can see already, like if we were using **turtle soup**, turtle soup would be that run above and just going in there, you know, and shorting it because we had a **divergence** due to **Dow**, **NASDAQ**, and **ES** making higher high style. But didn't do that.

### Conditions for Fair Value Gap Entry

I want to see this candle here create the fair value gap right there. I don't want to see it go up and have an immediate rebalance. I just want to see it close. This candle opens another one, then trades up into it, but not take out that low yet. I don't want to see that happen yet.

It looks like it looks like it's time to run. **Dollar Index** is nicely ran up into the level I was wanting to see. Beautiful, beautiful. And we do have a **fair value gap** here.

### Trading Practice: Limit Orders and Stop Losses

You can do one of two things here in your practice. You can set a **limit order** here at this high plus one tick and then use a **stop** of five handles and then use a **take profit** of five handles. Or, you can wait for it if you can trade up there. And that's like I said, I'm running the risk of not participating on this one because it's already running and not giving a return back to it, which is fine. But you didn't get in, ICT.

I know there's lots of moves that I don't participate in, just like you're going to discover.

### Breaker Identification and Utilization

Now we have a **breaker**. Okay, so while I don't want to utilize this as my entry, I do want to bring it to your attention because it's here now. The **breaker** is where we have a high, a low, and a higher high where it has taken by side. As I outlined in real time, this buy side that's been taken, our attention goes to the down move prior to the secondary higher high.

So, in numbers, in short, the low between the two highs. So, where's the down close in in that in that low here? These candles entirely, all that range, one, two, three, one, two, three. So, inside this range, that is a **bearish breaker**. So let's just say it goes up into this **Fair Bay Gap** here. You can short it, but you have to incorporate this because it can trade up into that as well, because it's a fair bag gap within the breaker.

So, ideally, I'd really want it to trade up into here, but it may be asking too much of it. So, I'm going to do a lower probability entry if we can go right above this high here. I'll just get one more time pump into that once more. I'll go short, risk five handles, and see if we can get five handle run.

### Liquidity Analysis and Smart Money

The **liquidity** is obviously sitting right below 40 14 25. So four zero one four two five. All these smooth lows here, their cell stops resting below that. So, if **smart money** has sold short up here collecting what the buy stops. So, they sold to those buy stops with this run here. So, where are they going to try to get out at?

Ideally, **market efficiency paradigm** is they're going to buy from sellers at a lower price. Markets here. Where are sellers at a lower price below these equal lows. I can enter here, but my five handles doesn't provide me enough shield where we are in that range with this fair value gap, which is also one of the things you have to contend with when you're trying to take entries.

### Risk Management and Trading Premium

Just because you feel confidently it's going to go to a specific level, you still have to consider the risk. And just because you might be right about where it's going, you can't chase it. You got to try you got to trade in a **premium** if you're going short. That means trading in a up close candle. It's one of the filters that many times is going to serve you better than you realize.

Now, if you can sell short and up close candles and buy and down close candles, you're giving yourself an advantage that most traders don't realize when they're trying to do entries.

### Execution and Submission to Market Dynamics

Now I just pressed that button, took forever to get it in there, okay? And now you just submit to it. If it takes you out, that's fine. If it stops you out, it's fine. And you want to submit to the idea that how much time does it take once you enter the trade? How much time does it take for you to see it move in your favor? Or if it stops you out, how fast did it take you to stop out.

Now, obviously, I'm using a **fair value gap** entry, but I'm using the context of that **breaker**. So, kind of like allows for more of the things I like to look for in price action but framing it is you know, being utilized with other tools. But hopefully, you can at least see that the reason why I'm entering is in that **Fairbank app** right here.

### Volume Imbalance and Risk Reduction

Now, there's a small little **volume imbalance** in here. I want to see it trade through that and not get back above it once it does go below it. Now, you reduce the risk, put it right above the breaker. That way, if I'm stopped out, it's a small little loss.

Now, all you're doing is studying price action, watching, does it still continuously deliver wanting to get down into? I have it sit to this low right here. But if I had more, let's go back to this idea where the sell side is.

### Practice Parameters: 5 for 5 and Market Observation

But when you're practicing, you want to have a five for five, five risk, five gain. I want to see it right here stay heavy and go lower. That would be an immediate rebalance. In other words, kind of like a **fair bag Gap** return and drops.

I want to see ES remain heavy. I want to see the dollar climb back up into 103.16 area. And also, you want to indicate in your journal that you're trading ahead of **FOMC**, so you're in a market climate that is not conducive for high precision. It's not conducive for low resistance liquidity run means the easy Salad Days type trading. That's not that's not where we're at.

But you want to practice in these conditions because by practicing in these conditions, you're preparing yourself really for the best when the Market's more free to move. In other words, when it's easier to see it Rally or or drop into levels that you expected when it's just real sudden movement all one favor just digging into it. That's the type of Trades I'm I teach my students to look for. I look for that as a signature in the marketplace versus this simply well the markets are moving today the markets are trading so therefore let me just go out here and try to make money that to me is not enough.

### Monitoring Market Dynamics: Dollar and Sell Stops

My eyes watching how we traded that low. I want to see it trade to that low and expand quickly to get these cell stops. That's what I'm looking for. Just a little bit of a movement up one dollar so far. I want to see it really get aggressive and dig into that 103 16 and higher.

### Risk Removal and Journaling

Now you want to remove the wrist because you've gone into new sell side. If it stops you out at this point, who cares? But because we went to this low here, the market can go back and revisit premium arrays and still not go to that sell side, which is the reason why I removed the risk.

And I need to submit to either one, either it stops you which you're fine with, it'll be stopped in profit, and it would be a favorable outcome for the exercise. Or it goes to your limit order and it closes your case study and you log it and you record immediately.

You don't go to social media and parade around or if you get stopped out, you don't go to social media and complain about it. You go right to your Journal, you Journal your entry suggesting what all the things positively that you did in the trade the observations, you know, you saw it trade down here, but it didn't take the limit order and it was way significantly enough to blow it because there you go.

### Debunking Hindsight Claims and Trade Analysis

So there you go. Iced tea is never going to do a live trade. He's never going to call the Market. He's never going to explain it. But yet here I am doing it. How about that? It's almost like it's pre-recorded hindsight. Is that precise enough for you?

So, what you want to do is you want to go through how much time? How much time did it take for that trade to deliver? Obviously, I did a little bit more than five handles, but you know, I have to work with what the Market's going to give me, right folks?

### Market Rigging and Emotional Control

So, right away, you should be thinking in your corners of your mouth should be aching because you watched all this happen and you can't believe it. I know. But this stuff happens every single day. It's been happening for the last 30 years for me. It's been happening before I was born.

Okay, these markets are absolutely rigged. Okay? They're absolutely rigged. There's no Randomness to it. The only thing that is going to be random is your emotional impulses when you're not equipped to know how to trade.

If you don't know what you're looking for, you're going to lose. If you know a model that you know what you're looking for, then you can aim for that and you can measure your progress. But you're not. Okay? You're not going to hit the target unless you have a Target. What's the target consistency? You're looking for something that repeats over and over again that's highly precise.

### Detachment and Market Perspective

I want you to take a step back from him, okay? And folks, understand this is not bragging because 10 handles is 10 handles. It's not that big of a deal. Okay? But you can make a mountain of a career doing that.

But I want you to take a look at what this chart looks like right here right now. And I want you to go back and listen to the recording. There was absolutely zero anxiety. There was Zero emotion. I was not hopped up on goofballs. I wasn't worrying about the trade panning out. I gave you exactly what I was thinking because of 30 years experience doing it.

I'm lending my experience and what I'm thinking while I'm watching price. I told you the very things I was looking at, why I was considering it. I told you about the breaker. I told you how to frame the breaker where it should stop. Did it stop at the high of the breaker to the tick, baby? To the tick.

This up close candle, this up close candle, and that up close candle. That's all my breaker that look at this price right here. Okay, up here in the upper left-hand corner, you see that right there? That high is 4025.75. The higher this candle comes in at 4026 even so it went one tick one tick which is a mohawk. Remember price has to go up one tick to allow delivery of perfect old High.

### Limit Orders and Market Framework

Think about if you had a limit order it has to move the the difference between the bid and the ask is one tick so it has to do what it has to at least go up there to offer the opportunity for that high to be booked but that framework think about the questions that many of you have asked them you probably are listening and now had the answer given to you how do you know ICT how do you know that when it was rallying like that how do you know that it won't go above that high there think about what I went through this morning with you okay I opened up the chart I showed you this shaded area down here okay we'll go back into that regular trading hours there so the difference between yesterday's closing price and regular trading session to where we opened today at 9 30.

That separation that distinction between those two price points is important that's the opening range Gap so if we open to a premium it opens like it does here it rallies comes back down rallies once more perfect we're watching now to see that fail go back and listen to my commentary I'm not concerned it's going to keep rallying higher because it's already done enough of that overnight this is a trap this down here allows them to do what Chase it lungs can say okay I missed the initial run up here bears go short here they put their stop loss right above this High the market drops down into the opening range Gap high and then rallies go back and listen to my commentary I did not take the short that I was interested in if it would have kept that candle with a fair bag got I would have shorted that then but because I was using the dollar Index to filter it kept me from doing what getting in prematurely plus the structure really wasn't all that it was just not it was not there yet so I mentioned that how looking at the other markets I said okay it looks like NASDAQ is looking like it wants to make a higher high let's take a look at Nasdaq real quick.

### NASDAQ, DOW, and ES Analysis: Divergence and Market Structure

I hope you guys can see this is not just random made up stuff it's a logic behind all this so this is relative equal highs I said we would like to run up and above that it did that look at the **Dow** see that **Divergence** there that's why I was trusting that we were not going to go higher and that was absolutely a good breaker I want es so let's go back to es I'm answering all your questions if you just listen to the boring stuff folks it's there there's a lot of people I started watching this video so he's talking too much and missed the entire move but this down closed candle these series of three down closed candles is the context behind that run up here that stops out anyone that was going short here because they want to do what they want to fade the Gap right okay the algorithm knows that it's going to come down rally through it all the buy stops are gone why is that useful just like I mentioned to you smart money will sell short to those buy stops they're going to sell to those buyers at a higher price **smart money** is accumulating oh my goodness we're getting Sleepless in Allen Texas tonight.

### Smart Money and Market Manipulation

So we're looking at this area here up in that area all here that's where **smart money** is going short okay so they're selling short there with the expectation that they want to do what buy it back at a cheaper price but who would be willing to sell it to them at a cheaper price think about who would who would be willing to do that anyone that's long here or went long on here it's the idea that this is support where they're going to place their stop loss where they just got wrecked so when **smart money's** considering entering a short the **market efficiency Paradigm** that I'm teaching you the way they engage price they're not looking at patterns they're looking at who they can take to the slaughterhouse they killed the people that were short when it ran above it they're done they're stopped out with a loss anyone that was short here gets stopped out anyone that went long down here oh it's Gap and go Doug no it's not listen to what ICT said we're going to Rally up take a new high and then we're going to watch and see does it Peter out and it did the market does back down and takes out the lungs so who's who's really right who I told you was going to be right the smart money selling here and they're going to be buying down here so when I'm looking at Price I'm looking at this to that shorting buying it back but because I told you I was going to limp on myself just to using a **fair value Gap** as my entry I have lots of tools I could very easily sold short.

## Market Analysis and Trading Strategy: Advanced Concepts and Real-Time Application

### Rule Breaking and Model Adherence
*   The speaker admits to breaking his own rules "just for ego purposes," emphasizing that this is **not** the purpose of his teachings.
*   The primary goal is to teach others to identify and apply **their own models**, specifically referencing the **2022 model** demonstrated in the session.
*   Crucial context: selling at a **premium**. If the ideal price isn't available, adherence to the 2022 model dictates waiting for displacement or a shift in market structure below a low.

### Fair Value Gaps and Breaker Integration
*   Following a shift in market structure, **two fair value gaps** are identified.
*   The speaker advises caution when selling short in these gaps due to the presence of a **breaker**.
*   The market's subsequent rally reinforces the need to consider the breaker's influence.

### SMT Divergence and Algorithm Behavior
*   The speaker dismisses concerns about the market making a higher high due to **SMT (Smart Money Technique) divergence**, where the **Dow** makes a **lower high** while the **NASDAQ** and **ES** need **higher highs**.
*   This divergence indicates cracking correlation and suggests a "suspect rally" intended to take out stops for short positions.
*   The algorithm is expected to return to the candle's high, due to the fact that the algorithm seeks what? Orders and Inefficiencies.
*   The algorithm's actions are predictable because it seeks:
    *   Buy-side liquidity.
    *   Premium fair value gaps or inefficiencies.
    *   Sell-side liquidity at old lows.
    *   Discount inefficiencies.

### Applying the 2022 Model
*   The speaker emphasizes using only one timeframe and the tools already taught in the 2022 model.
*   For new traders fearful of trading, the advice is to follow the model's rules.
*   This involves waiting for the market to move lower, specifically below a short-term swing low.
*   The range from high to low defines protraction. During a drop, the expectation is the formation of a **fair value gap**.
*   With multiple fair value gaps, price should be given leeway to reach the second gap. The breaker's presence mandates accounting for price potentially reaching its high.
*   Trading beyond the breaker's high is acceptable and can open a buy for the trader for the remainder of the day.

### Managing Fear and Reacting to Price
*   The speaker highlights the difference between fearing stop-outs and adapting bias based on market behavior.
*   The speaker emphasizes that they are outlining what the price will gravitate to. The market was going to make a higher high.
*   The speaker claims to outline the likely market movements beforehand, emphasizing a lack of reaction to price action.

### Discount Levels and Liquidity Pools
*   Using the **2022 model**, the speaker measures from a low to a high, identifying the **50% level** as equilibrium.
*   A discount is sought below this level, with the focus on lows and relative equal lows as potential liquidity pools.
*   Lower levels with more liquidity are considered more attractive targets.

### Breaker Mechanics and Core Content
*   The speaker showcases a classic **breaker** setup, a familiar concept from introductory lessons.
*   The speaker asserts those core content lessons serve as "viral advertising" and "seeds in the minds" of traders.
*   Advanced students are unconcerned about the widespread availability of these lessons because they understand the depth of additional mentorship content.

### Precision and Accuracy
*   The speaker highlights the session's real-time, precise, and accurate execution, emphasizing the lack of emotion, ego, or contrivance.
*   The speaker stresses that this accuracy should boost confidence in their teaching methods.

### Smart Money and Algorithmic Market Making
*   The speaker refutes the idea of traditional market makers controlling price.
*   Market making is now primarily **algorithmic**.
*   The speaker refers to "dealers," who are often incorrectly called market makers, and states that these dealers do not have control over the market.
*   The speaker emphasizes that the entities referred to as "smart money" are not who people think they are.

### Algorithm Existence and Predictability
*   The speaker poses the question of how they can predict market movements so precisely if an algorithm doesn't exist.
*   The speaker expresses a willingness to demonstrate their abilities in court and challenges others to disprove the existence of an algorithm.

### Market Manipulation and Emotional Control
*   The speaker firmly states that markets are "absolutely rigged" and lack randomness.
*   Emotional impulses are the only random factor when traders lack knowledge and preparation.
*   Success requires a defined target and the pursuit of consistent, repeatable, and precise patterns.

### Detachment and Market Perspective
*   The speaker emphasizes the importance of detachment and a lack of emotion in trading.
*   The speaker describes outlining all of their actions based on years of experience.

### Limit Orders and Market Framework
*   The speaker reminds the listener of the necessity for limit orders to allow for perfect highs.
*   The speaker addresses a question often asked of them in reference to anticipating a high within an uptrend. The speaker goes on to detail a shade area on the chart from the prior day.
*   The speaker claims that there is an importance to separating the difference between the previous day's closing price and regular trading session to where the market opened that day at 9:30.
*   The speaker notes that if the market opens to a premium, that it is common for it to rally and return down, then rally once more.
*   The speaker states that he wasn't concerned about the market rallying higher because enough of that occurred overnight, claiming it was a trap.
*   The speaker says that the drop allowed the market to be chased long by people.

### NASDAQ, DOW, and ES Analysis: Divergence and Market Structure
*   The speaker stresses that their analysis is based on logic, not random guesses.
*   The speaker claims that they trust that the market won't go higher due to the divergence of the DOW.

### Smart Money and Market Manipulation
*   The speaker states that the algorithm knows that retail traders want to "fade the gap."
*   Smart money is selling short with the expectation that they want to buy at a cheaper price.
*   The speaker then details smart money's actions regarding who to take to the slaughterhouse.
*   The speaker states they told everyone that smart money was going to sell at a high and buy down low, and therefore the smart money was right.
*   The speaker mentions that they used the fair value gap as their entry point, and that they have a plethora of different tools to use.

*   **Old New Week Opening Gap Low:** Looking for a move up into that area.
*   **Upside Target:** If price gets above 4089.25, then 4104 is a potential continuation target if there is rejection of any possible correction. Not a suggestion, just a possibility.
*   **Patience:** Waiting for the 10 o'clock hour and giving up the first 30 minutes of trading in the opening range.

## Morning Mapping

## Index Divergence Observations
*   **ES:** Multiple higher highs.
*   **Dow:** No similar higher highs.
*   **NASDAQ:** Similar pattern to ES.

## Thursday Characteristics

    *   Thursday, 8:30 candle.
    *   Identified as a SIBI (Sell-Side Imbalance, Buy-Side Inefficiency).
*   **Potential Scenario:** If the dollar can correct into that, it would allow ES to try to reach some measure of the south side or a discount.
*   **Waiting for Alignment:** Staying in a narrow range, waiting for the time of day to align with better price delivery.

# Trading Insights and Market Analysis

## Internal Conflict: Trader vs. Dad

*   Highlights his proven track record and accuracy in predicting market movements, often exceeding 90% accuracy, documented over years and various mentorship groups.
*   Questions the logic of paying for expert mentorship (e.g., from **Tiger Woods** in golf) and then ignoring the advice given.
*   Struggles to understand why individuals, knowing his consistency, fight his guidance on price direction and then complain about their lack of success.

*   Observes his son's eagerness to get funded and insists on trading his own way, which makes it harder than it needs to be.
*   Acknowledges his impatience but attempts to be patient and avoid harsh criticism.
*   Highlights his son's competitive nature and desire to prove himself, which may be influencing his trading decisions.
*   Speculates that his son's reluctance to listen stems from a subconscious desire to succeed independently and claim a personal "trophy."

*   Shares that he may have a migraine from the stress caused by his son's trading choices.
*   Describes a scenario where he is calling for higher levels, while his son is focused on potential shorts and lower levels due to perceived gaps, disregarding his broader analysis.

## Market Observations and Strategies

*   Notes that the market almost reached 4088, which is a consequent encroachment of an old new week opening gap.
*   The Dollar Index is still near its low for the day.
*   The Dow futures are sliding lower, contrasting with the NASDAQ and ES, which made higher highs.
*   This constitutes SMT (Smart Money Technique) divergences.
*   After analyzing a premium new week opening gap and the opening range gap high (9:30's opening price), he's not interested in chasing the market higher.
*   He is willing to miss potential moves to 4100, emphasizing the importance of sticking to his rules.
*   Being wrong due to following the rules is acceptable, but deviating from them is detrimental.
*   He avoids impulsive actions and acknowledges that it's not one of those days.
*   He's not trading based on external stimuli.

## Market Conditions and Influences

*   Identifies potential discount arrays, including sell-side liquidity pools and a small fair value gap.
*   He is watching the low down below as the market is selling off.

## Short Trade Scenario

*   The market attempted many times to go higher and logically failed, breaking below relative equal lows.
*   States he wanted the price to trade below those lows.
*   Acknowledges some traders might have viewed an earlier point as a shift in market structure, allowing them to go short at the low of the fair value gap.
*   A fair value gap was seen with the opening of the next candle and the market traded down, leaving it there.
*   Price came back up into it and he expects repricing down into this sell side there.
*   The speaker admits he was looking at the five minute chart when he should have been looking at the one minute chart, unfortunately.
*   He noted that the market did what he was expecting by going down.
*   There was a fair value gap and price went up and he mentioned using those highs as an entry going short.
*   Some traders jumped on that entry.
*   The south side, that they were pointing to earlier, was hit.


# Trading Insights and Market Analysis

## Refining Imbalances and Sell-Side Liquidity

*   On the five-minute chart, a **fair value gap (discount array)** was identified.
*   A closer look reveals a refined imbalance on the one-minute chart, allowing for a more precise adjustment.
*   This refined imbalance is still located below the mentioned low, indicating potential **sell-side liquidity.**
*   The market is observed approaching this **sell-side** area.

## Support and Resistance Dynamics

*   Classic support and resistance theory suggests that a broken support level should act as resistance upon a retest.
*   When encountering a wick (price extension), the strategy involves splitting it in half.
*   The **consequent encroachment** (the midpoint) of the wick is then used as a potential target.
*   Longer wicks may necessitate price movement further into or even above an old low before a downward move.

## Analyzing Candle Closure and Price Action

*   The speaker would prefer that the body of the one large candle, between the low of the first candle and the high of the third candle, not close in entirely.
*   Even with a repricing higher, he wants to see that area remain at least partially open.
*   He is willing to see it trade up into a little bit, but he doesn't want to see it entirely close in that.
*   **Reference Points:** Anchoring the analysis between the first candle and the third candle.
*   **Tolerance:** Comfortable with price trading back up to 4076.25 or even 4076.75.

## Managing Uncertainty and Manipulation

*   Acknowledges that the market can be manipulated at any time.
*   Highlights the importance of allowing for uncertainties, such as manipulation or unforeseen events.
*   These events could include:
    *   Political upheaval
    *   Acts of war
    *   Unforeseen natural events
*   These events can cause unexpected market reactions, rendering models temporarily ineffective.
*   The current period is described as "**Black Swan season**," where unexpected events can cause significant market disruptions.

## Targeting Sell-Side Liquidity and Silver Bullet Setup

*   Anticipating a move towards **sell-side liquidity** below 4070.75.
*   Monitoring for a potential spike through to the 4069 level.
*   Introduces the concept of the "**Silver Bullet**" trade, referring to a setup that forms every trading day between **10:00 AM and 11:00 AM New York local time**.
*   This setup involves:
    *   Waiting for a price displacement in the anticipated direction.
    *   Identifying a **fair value gap** that forms after the displacement.
    *   Expecting price to trade into the **fair value gap** and then reprice towards a **pool of liquidity** opposing the entry.

## The Silver Bullet: Consistency and Patience

*   The **Silver Bullet** setup is described as consistent, reliable, and always present.
*   This setup is designed to teach patience and adherence to a rule-based model.
*   New traders are encouraged to focus on capturing five handles (points) using this setup.
*   Acknowledges the challenges new traders face:
    *   Deciding who to trust
    *   Avoiding wasted time
    *   The fallacy of seeking a no-loss system
*   Emphasizes practicing in a demo environment and identifying consistent price patterns.

## Specific Time Window and Fair Value Gaps

*   Suggests that within a specific 60-minute time window, finding a five-handle run is reasonably achievable.
*   Of all the ICT concepts, fair value gaps are the easiest to visually identify.
*   The 2022 model was designed with simplicity in mind.

## Real-Time Application and Study

*   Live sessions and Twitter interactions aim to help traders recognize setups in real-time.
*   Stresses the importance of studying past moves and identifying recurring patterns.
*   The **Silver Bullet** is time-specific and forms between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM.

## Understanding Time Macros

*   The 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM window represents the latter part of the morning session move.
*   **Fair value gaps** typically form after a move has already begun.
*   Between 8:30 AM and 11:00 AM (potentially noon), the heart of the AM session move occurs.
*   **Time Macros:**
    *   **9:50 AM - 10:10 AM:** A price run often begins within this 20-minute window.
    *   **10:50 AM - 11:10 AM:** Another macro where a price run starts.
*   The speaker cautions against incorrectly teaching his concepts, such as claiming the entire move happens between 9:50 AM and 10:10 AM.
*   The focus is on identifying a run that *begins* during that timeframe.

## Managing Expectations and Sticking to the Rules

*   Focus on capturing five handles, rather than demanding the entire daily range.
*   Acknowledges that the move may sometimes be a significant higher low of the day, leading to a larger run, but this isn't always predictable.
*   Emphasizes sticking to the rules to avoid false expectations.

## Case in Point: Fair Value Gap

*   Refers to a **fair value gap** that he was monitoring earlier.
*   He was looking at the five-minute chart instead of the one-minute chart, due to being preoccupied with speaking.
*   He mentioned going short if price bumped against it, expecting it to run lower.
*   Price reached 4078.75, offering more than five handles.
*   Although it did not reach the **sell-side**, the model was not considered broken.

## Learning Through Observation and Patience

*   Urges against impulsively trying to trade based on real-time commentary.
*   Instead, focus on learning the rules and parameters through observation and studying old moves.
*   The delivery of five handles is described as a consistent and reliable setup.

## The Silver Bullet as a Complete Model

*   The **Silver Bullet** offers a framework for traders with limited time.
*   Suggests taking a lunch break between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM to focus on this setup.
*   The goal is to minimize chart time and reduce fatigue.

## Managing Expectations and Statistical Probability

*   Acknowledge that not every **Silver Bullet** trade will be a winner.
*   The key is that the setup statistically presents an opportunity.
*   Encourages traders to review past data to confirm the consistency of the setup.
*   Focus on whether the setup *offers* the potential for more than five handles.
*   The speaker wanted to see the more recent low taken out before going short.
*   An aggressive entry would have been right at the fair value gap, which did offer five handles, but did not reach the sell side.
*   Operating inside these rules.


## Navigating Market Realities: Expectations, Rules, and Emotional Discipline

### Managing Expectations and Market Volatility

*   Recognize that adhering to rules doesn't guarantee a five-handle profit every time.
*   Price may not always reach your intended entry point, like failing to tag your limit order.
*   Avoid frustration; many future opportunities exist each day the market is open and you are mentally capable.
*   Consider this continuous process as a laboratory experiment.

### Timeframe for Developing Confidence

*   Realistically, it may take **two to three months** to confidently use this model.
*   Analyze **previous data** to validate the concepts.
*   After validation, dedicate several months to tape reading, observing price action in real-time.

### The State of Boredom: The Green Light for Live Trading

*   When you reach a state of **indifference** to the outcome, neither nervous nor excited, you're bored.
*   Boredom signifies a detachment from emotional trading.
*   Only when you are bored should you consider using real money.
*   This decision is entirely subjective and personal; no mentor can definitively declare you "ready."

### Avoiding Emotional Trading

*   Ensure you're not chasing a "feel-good" outcome or trying to compensate for past losses.
*   Focus solely on rule adherence.
*   New traders may struggle with this due to a lack of rules, experience, and historical data to confirm the model's consistent behavior.

### The Silver Bullet Model: Key Components

*   Occurs daily between **10:00 AM and 11:00 AM.**
*   **Identify liquidity**.
*   Locate a **fair value gap** that opposes the anticipated direction of the liquidity grab.
    *   For instance, after a downward displacement, locate a **fair value gap** above the current market price.
    *   Wait for price to trade up into the **fair value gap**.
    *   Anticipate price moving towards a lower pool of liquidity (sell-side).
*   In a bullish scenario:
    *   Look for a price displacement higher, leaving a **fair value gap** below.
    *   Expect price to trade down to the **fair value gap**.
    *   Anticipate price gravitating toward a pool of buy-side liquidity.
*   Ensure a potential range of at least **five handles** from your anticipated entry.

### Shifting the Focus: Excellence in Execution Over Being "Right"

*   The focus should not be on being right, but rather excellence in execution.
*   Achieving excellence requires adhering to the specified actions and avoiding prohibited ones.
*   Resist the temptation to disregard instructions, even if emotionally driven.
*   Avoid painful experiences such as account resets or refunds by following the rules.

### Avoiding the Pitfalls of Mimicry

*   Don't try to copy the speaker's personality or mannerisms.
*   Especially avoid replicating the speaker's earlier trading approaches when they lacked understanding.
*   The speaker's teaching aims to prevent such mistakes.

### Identifying Problematic Patterns in Communication

*   Be wary of traders whose questions or comments reveal a flawed perspective.
*   These individuals may consistently disregard advice, leading to poor outcomes.
*   Even with accurate predictions, some traders will still act contrary to recommended strategies and then express confusion when things don't work out.

### The Consequences of Fading the Model

*   If you have previously disregarded the speaker's advice, despite a proven track record, and experienced negative outcomes, reflect on your reasoning.
*   The goal isn't to criticize, but to understand why you chose to fade the model.

### Overcoming Misconceptions about Market Movement

*   Avoid thinking that a move is "too far" or questioning why the market can't return for stops or specific price levels.
*   Thinking in terms of buying and selling pressure or "overbought/oversold" conditions is incorrect.
*   Instead, understand that the market seeks liquidity or inefficiency.

### Interpreting Market Signals: A Buy Model Example

*   On a specific Tuesday, a buy model began following the speaker's Monday indication of focusing on the buy side.
*   Review the referenced YouTube video at the 1:30 mark for confirmation.
*   While discount arrays were mentioned, the focus remained on targeting higher prices.
*   The speaker didn't anticipate a continuous, one-way upward trend but acknowledged recent market choppiness demanding heightened focus.

### Recognizing Difficult Market Conditions

*   The speaker noted on Twitter that a session was likely to be difficult, and that expectations should be lowered.
*   Beware of those who only reveal successful trades *after* the fact.
*   Base decisions on the real-time price action of the right edge of the chart.

### Overcoming Fear and Intimidation

*   Acknowledge that it is normal to feel fear and intimidation due to uncertainty about future candle movements.
*   Extended demo trading can reduce emotional attachment to outcomes.

### Focus on Rule Adherence, Not Being Right

*   Focus on following the rules, regardless of the outcome.
*   Adhere to pre-defined profit targets and stop-loss placements.

### Strict Stop-Loss Management

*   Never widen a stop-loss after it's set; only reduce risk.
*   If tempted to increase risk by widening a stop, close the trade instead.
*   Recognize this impulse as a sign that you've lost your way.

### Avoiding the "I Have to Be Right" Mentality

*   Resist the urge to impose your will on the market.
*   Recognize when you're trying to force a trade to work based on a preconceived notion.

### Learning to Anticipate Difficult Market Conditions

*   Choppy conditions can be anticipated.
*   The market had moved parabolically upwards from Tuesday with no real retracements lower.
*   Avoid the misconception that negative news will automatically cause a market crash.
*   The market is not controlled by buying and selling pressure alone.

### A Day to Stay on the Sidelines

*   On days like these, the speaker would usually stay out of the market if not teaching.

### Deconstructing the Day's Market Conditions

*   On a daily chart, a previously identified **fair value deficiency** was reached.
*   The market traded into the opening price of that candle.
*   The market traded into a **new week opening gap**.

### New Week Opening Gaps within Order Flow

*   When assessing order flow, identify where the **new week opening gap** resides.
*   The market tends to accumulate algorithmically around these **new week opening gaps**.
*   Initially, you might feel overwhelmed by the number of these gaps; focus on identifying just five.
*   The key is to pinpoint the **new week opening gap** that runs through old order flow.
*   The market will likely trade back up into that area later.

### The Bigger Picture

*   Because of one-way price action, the market has done the following:
    *   Multiple premium arrays.
    *   Reached the rejection block (up-close candle closing price).
    *   Traded through the consequent encroachment of the wick.
    *   Reached the old high and consequent encroachment of the swing high.
    *   All the way to the low of that candle, which is the high of the fair value gap.
*   The low of the order block has been traded to and through.
*   The closing/opening price of the order block candle has also been tagged.
*   Inside this high, there's a new week opening gap where the market has traded to.
*   "So what has the market really done? Nothing."

### Encouraging Independent Price Analysis

*   The goal is for you to analyze price independently.
*   The speaker seeks to make his teachings understandable.

### The Importance of Diligence and Effort

*   You're going to have to put some effort into listening and going through the motions like any other student with due diligence.
*   The techniques are too valuable to be superficially disseminated.
*   If others teaching these concepts don't achieve the same results, it's due to an incomplete understanding of the material.


## Navigating Challenging Market Conditions: A Guide to Preservation

### Leaving the Nest: Independence and Avoiding Over-Reliance

*   "Need to come back to your **YouTube channel**" - This serves as a gentle reminder to the audience that the aim is to foster independence.
*   The speaker explicitly discourages followers from relying on him for constant **AD Revenue**. The goal is self-sufficiency.
*   He states, "I'm not going to produce all kinds of content on a day by day basis, a weekly basis. I'm done." This is to emphasize that he has imparted the knowledge and skills needed for independent trading.
*   The speaker desires his students "to do well" and "be comfortable" navigating various market conditions.

### Avoiding Common Pitfalls in Bull Runs

*   The speaker stresses the importance of understanding the nuances of the market, especially "what makes it hard."
*   He emphasizes, "I'm not trying to pick a top." This is a crucial point, as attempting to time the market top in a bull run can be detrimental.
*   He states definitively, "My students know I do not try to pick tops in bull runs. I don't do it."
*   Those who attempt to pick tops will "have your face ripped off." It is not the system or the concepts failing; it's the trader deviating from the strategy.
*   The speaker expresses frustration over individuals who exhibit "selective hearing" and blame the concepts when they fail to follow instructions.
*   He even highlights the human tendency to repeat mistakes, stating, "My own flesh and blood are showing that human trait."

### Market Analysis: Sweeping the Rejection Block

*   The discussion turns to specific market observations: "So we swept the rejection block here."
*   The high of "this candle here went above that," referring to a specific price point.
*   Price also went "above the opening range Gap High, which is the 9:30 opening price."
*   Currently, price is "back inside the fair value gap."
*   The market is now at a critical juncture: "Now it's basically do or die because we're inside of the breaker here," which would be a bearish breaker.
*   He points out the "mean threshold of that, which could be inversion," and the "old fair value gap here."
*   The key question is: "We want to see how it respects that. Does it want to offer support or does it go through it one more time and offer resistance?"
*   The speaker concludes this section by stating, "Very, very, very difficult market conditions."

### The Honesty of Experience: Recognizing Market Difficulty

*   The speaker emphasizes the challenging nature of current market conditions.
*   He declares, "I don't care who they are, I don't care what accolades they have behind their name, if any of the traders in the communities, whether it be ours or abroad, if they ever come out and say that these marking conditions right now are easy, it's so easy, they're lying, and trust me, they're lying."
*   He asserts that anyone with "real experience" understands the difficulty of the current price action.
*   He acknowledges that market conditions will change: "It doesn't stay like this, but there are going to be periods in the future when it frees up and starts moving around a little bit more."
*   He emphasizes that "the Legends shine" during these difficult periods, while those with "potluck wins" will struggle.
*   He specifically calls out individuals new to trading as being unaware of the current market dynamics.
*   The importance of being "boring" is highlighted: those who are "really consistent" and avoid "get rich quick stuff" are more likely to succeed.
*   He underscores the need to "dial back risk," "dial back leverage," and "dial back frequency." Doing less is often more in such environments.

### Risk Management in Challenging Markets

*   The speaker explains that in difficult markets, the chances of success are "probably slim to none" for new traders.
*   He cautions against trying to quickly recover losses, as this can be especially dangerous in the current market.
*   He contrasts the current market with "a faster market that's trying to get somewhere and it's obvious," where mitigating losses is easier.
*   The current market is described as "a lot of whipsawing, consolidating, not making obvious runs."
*   The speaker points out that "the market comes in these phases where it's like it does this sometimes, and all of a sudden some kind of event will free it up."
*   While it's relatively easy to fix a losing trade in a faster market, "it is not easy to fix drawdown in these types of conditions."
*   He emphasizes his 30 years of experience, saying, "I'm telling you there ain't nobody out there that's going to tell you that this is a market right now that's easy. It's absolutely grinding people down."
*   He acknowledges that new traders might unrealistically expect to have mastered these conditions quickly.
*   The best students know "to be careful, to be almost still, doing nothing, waiting."
*   The key is to exercise "patience" and "self-control."
*   Those who lack these qualities will be "usher[ed] out the door," losing their money.

### Avoiding the Trap of Success Stories and Illusions

*   The speaker warns against being misled by success stories.
*   He acknowledges upcoming interviews with successful students but emphasizes, "Don't look at these success stories and think I'm gonna go out there and do that right now because I want to have an interview with ICT. I'm I'm not that big of a deal okay."
*   He urges listeners not to be motivated by these stories into thinking the market is currently easy.
*   He states emphatically, "I promise you, sincerely, right now is very, very difficult, even for me."
*   He emphasizes that even with experience, the market is showing "a lot of whipsawing."
*   His advice is simple: "When in doubt, stay out."

### The Importance of Recognizing Uncertainty and Turning off the Charts

*   The speaker highlights that new traders often feel compelled to trade despite uncertainty.
*   He says, "In the beginning... when you're doubting it, you think, oh, I gotta go in there and just overcome my fear and just press the button."
*   He warns, "Well, placed through the games, win stupid prizes." In other words, acting recklessly will lead to negative outcomes.
*   He advises listening to one's conscience: "You should have stuck to your conscience telling you I really don't know what to expect, and I'm uncomfortable, and I don't have the wherewithal..."
*   The best course of action is often to "just turn the charts off."
*   He teaches with the perspective of protecting traders from false confidence in difficult markets.
*   He acknowledges his limitations as a mentor, admitting he doesn't have a teaching method to make these environments easy.
*   Instead, his lectures focus on "jawboning and beating this in their head, saying this is where you don't want to be trading."

### Recognizing Stagnant and Deceptive Price Action

*   The speaker asks his 2023 mentorship students, "Can you see the difference? Can you feel the difference watching these candles paint like this versus when the market's really just liquidly moving up and down?"
*   He contrasts the current stagnant price action with conditions where the market is "gyrating... going to liquidity that's obvious to see... going to imbalances that's easy to see... it's elongated... it's stretched out... it's moving around a lot of movement."
*   He emphasizes, "You're not seeing that right now. You're seeing this... this is stagnant price action."
*   He warns, "You cannot look at this and think, oh, yeah, this is exactly what I want to trade. You do that with this, you're losing your account."
*   He states, "There's no easier way to give you a representation of what to avoid than seeing this. This is it. This is the stuff. This is the Molasses swamp."

### Candyland Analogy: The Molasses Swamp of the Market

*   The speaker uses an analogy from the board game Candyland to illustrate the dangers of the current market conditions.
*   He explains, "Remember the children's game I grew up playing, a board game called Candyland, and I've used that expression when I'm talking about liquidity above relative equal highs and relatively cool lows."
*   He recalls that "in that board game, there's a little area called molasses swamp... if you ended up in that, you were stuck there."
*   He likens the current market to the molasses swamp, stating, "Well, this is what this is like. You're in quicksand, and the more you do to try to get out of struggling sinking in quicksand, it makes it worse, and you sink. That's your account going lower."

### Mindset and Avoiding the Trap

*   The speaker emphasizes that books often fail to adequately address the necessary mindset for avoiding losses.
*   He asserts, "Books don't do enough to teach this mindset. When you see things like this, there hasn't been a book out there that I've ever bought or even read... they never talk about these things..."
*   He explains that books tend to focus on strategies for entering profitable trades but neglect the crucial aspect of avoiding damaging trades.
*   He states, "They're trying to promote an idea of you getting into something, not avoiding. Trading the whole idea of selling the book, the course, the authorship of something that they knew how to get in a move that works, but they don't know how to avoid the moves that blow their account, that draw them down."
*   He emphasizes his ability to communicate and demonstrate these principles to his students: "I've been around here long enough to know what that is, and I know how to communicate it. I know how to show it to my students."
*   He observes that students who understand this avoid reckless behavior and account blow-ups.
*   They recognize the challenging conditions and choose to "go do something else."
*   He acknowledges that new traders often struggle with this, feeling compelled to constantly trade.

### An Argument for Patience: The Afternoon Session

*   The speaker observes that the dollar index is ranging within a tight range.
*   He suggests, "In a day like this, I would favor the afternoon session."
*   He anticipates that the afternoon session "might do something in here that's animated."
*   He acknowledges that he may not personally trade the afternoon session but encourages viewers to form their own opinions.

### Focusing on Risk Management, Not Just Identifying Moves

*   The speaker addresses the tendency of new traders to focus on identifying potential moves without considering risk management.
*   He states, "When you're new, it's easy to see four handle runs and think, what, you know, that was a move right there. I thought I was going to go down there, and he didn't even talk about that."
*   He reminds listeners that he has already taught them how to identify targets and be precise with entries.
*   The key to success is not just identifying potential moves but also managing risk: "You didn't put a stop loss in and manage the risk in it. You're talking about what you saw happening."
*   He emphasizes that calling out potential moves is fine for paper trading and tape reading, but not for live trading in the current environment.
*   He states, "You shouldn't be in here pushing a button in an environment like this because the risk is undefined."

### Acknowledging Uncertainty and Avoiding Arrogance

*   The speaker highlights the difficulty of defining risk in the current market.
*   He asks, "Where are you gonna... where are you gonna limit your risk? Where's the risk low and defined where it makes sense? Where's the next draw in liquidity?"
*   He candidly admits, "I don't know."
*   He anticipates potential criticism, stating, "What do you just say? What's the calendar? I got to write it down. ICT on live stream this says he doesn't know right now."
*   He points out that this is not the first time he has acknowledged uncertainty.
*   He poses a rhetorical question: "So if I don't know where the next drawing liquidity is, how the hell do you think you're going to know it?"
*   He addresses the potential accusation of arrogance, stating, "Well, that's arrogant."
*   He emphasizes that his knowledge is being offered to help others learn, stating “if you’re here trying to learn from me, how are you going to know?"
*   If someone accurately predicts the market's movement in these conditions, "it was luck"; if they are wrong, "it's regret." In either case, the situation is "something to be avoided."
*   He concludes that there is "nothing to frame this in high probability."

### Staying on the Sidelines: Acknowledging Personal Limitations

*   The speaker emphasizes that he is willing to stay out of the market despite potential opportunities.
*   He states, "I don't know if it's going to take out the 4071 quarter... down here where the sell side is. I'd like to see it. I'd like to see the dollar go up to the level I told you..."
*   However, he clarifies, "If it was to do that there on the live stream, it would still be me saying that would be a tree that I wouldn't be in."
*   Even if he correctly predicts the market's direction, he would log it only as experience, not as a missed trading opportunity.
*   He reiterates, "I won't be in it. I'm not going to trade it. I won't participate in it because it's showing me every reason why I should not be touching it."
*   He explains that the market is "not respecting anything, it's just chopping around sideways."
*   He promises viewers that other live streamers attempting to trade in these conditions are likely "getting slopped up and chopped up, probably cussing, ranting, and raven, or kill their live stream, regretting even went out here."

### The Importance of Recognizing and Avoiding Difficult Conditions

*   The speaker reminds listeners that he had warned them earlier about the tough session ahead.
*   He states, "I told you this morning that we would have what a tough session because the mood was delivered before, and I told you where I was going. That was eight handles, nine handles, almost 10 handles this morning before the news even came out at 8:30."
*   He explains that clean moves in the early session, reaching targets quickly, often lead to difficult conditions later.
*   He warns about "consolidation potentially rolling into Seek and Destroy," which he describes as "a day where you will not make money."
*   He describes the common experience of getting stopped out on both long and short positions, then missing the eventual parabolic move due to fear.
*   He relates this experience to his own past, stating, "I've fallen victim to that a lot as a 20 year old, and I know where where they're forming now, and I teach it. It's in the core content. It's right on my YouTube channel. It's all part of my language."
*   He emphasizes that simply watching the videos is not enough; traders need to be in a mentorship to fully understand and apply the concepts.
*   He concludes by stating, "I've already taught you how to make money. I've already taught you how to be precise about your entries, how to find your targets. That's already on my YouTube channel. It's been up there... the reason why you failed is because you're pushing the button in environments like this. This is what's done you in, not my concepts. It's the market that isn't going to move for anyone, not even for me."
*   He asks, "Am I foolish to say I have really strong technical tools and Concepts? I'm the market maker Beast out there? Look at me, I'm Mr. Everything, and I'm going to be able to do something in this? Hell no! It ain't doing anything. It's not doing anything but hurting people."

### Learning from the Past: Avoiding Repeated Mistakes

*   The speaker draws on his 30 years of experience to emphasize the importance of learning from past mistakes.
*   He states, "I know because of 30 years having done this, I knew where I hurt myself, and I don't need to walk down that road and have my arm ripped off by that pit bull that I know is sitting there waiting for me to pass by it again that I've done it 95 other times."
*   He clarifies, "I need to go there on a 96th time to know that, and that's not my story."
*   He attributes this analogy to Larry Williams, stating, "I picked that up from Larry Williams. It just works. That analogy worked, it made sense to me."
*   He concludes by urging listeners to learn from questionable market conditions, saying, "But how many times do you have to see a questionable Market condition and you think I see a fair Vegas? I see relative equal lows? That's what my son seen, and he arm wrestled it."


## Navigating Challenging Market Conditions: A Guide to Preservation (Continued)

### Learning from Mistakes: The Pain of Experience

*   The speaker continues from his previous statement, emphasizing his son’s experience: "and arm wrestled it and arm wrestled it just let me do it dad just let me do it okay it's your money Bob."
*   He notes that even when his student, "blink auto field," looks at him, he resists saying "I told you so," but acknowledges the student must experience the pain of loss to truly learn.
*   The speaker states he's "done trying to prevent it," having tried to help his students avoid pitfalls.

### Premium Arrays and Russian Roulette

*   The speaker strongly advises against fighting against premium arrays, comparing it to "literally playing Russian roulette with five bullets and six Chambers."
*   He emphasizes the slim odds of success and survival when ignoring these established market principles.

### The Toxic Loser Cycle: A Common Trap

*   He laments the common path of new traders who dismiss experienced mentors and rush into trading: "oh yeah sell this guy man he's got this **YouTube channel** and he talks about these things."
*   They attempt to profit from easily accessible concepts like "Order Blocks," try to get funded accounts, open live accounts, and over-leverage small account balances.
*   They discover they are "trying to do something that you don't know how to do" and rush into risky conditions unprepared.
*   This begins "that toxic loser cycle," where they doubt everything and become trolls.
*   They may "pretend you are" making money online while criticizing others, despite their own failures.
*   The speaker expresses concern that "people go to the extreme and they check out of this world," highlighting the devastating impact of trading losses.
*   He emphasizes his commitment to helping traders avoid these pitfalls.

### Recognizing Good and Bad Trading Days

*   The speaker emphasizes his extensive effort in trying to "hammer it down" the importance of being able to differentiate between good and bad days.
*   He stresses that "we can see when it's going to be a good day" as a community.
*   He acknowledges his role in guiding his students: "I'm guiding all of you," especially in knowing "when the salad days are there when it's going to be easy trading."
*   He also acknowledges knowing "where it's going to be difficult even for me," and warns against live trading on those days: "don't open your Live account."
*   He reiterates that his live streams are not an endorsement of reckless trading: "just because I'm live streaming does not mean okay it's Casino time."
*   He discourages blind trust, even in his own analysis: "I trust ICT's always right look at him he's always right."
*   He reflects on a recent trade, noting he "was wrong with the sell side" in the Super Bowl trade, but it "still offered five handles."
*   He underscores the importance of accepting smaller profits, as "five handles a day...is good money" if done consistently.

### Redefining Success: Consistency Over Grand Slams

*   The speaker challenges the notion that success requires huge, infrequent wins, saying "20R 50r trades or that ain't success."
*   He stresses the value of consistent, smaller profits, even if it's the only thing someone achieves under his tutelage: "that's not failure."
*   He asserts this puts traders "way better than 99.99 of everybody else because they have no idea what they're looking for."
*   He criticizes reactive trading based on indicators: "they're waiting on some kind of indicator to tell them it's doing something."

### The Advantage of Time-Based Analysis

*   The speaker contrasts indicator-based trading with his time-based approach, asking, "when's the indicator going to give you your buy or sell signal?"
*   He highlights the predictability of his method: "we have a specific element of time that's advantageous to us."
*   He contrasts this to his earlier days, stating, “I wasted years trying to crack that and there's nothing in that”

### Real-World Data vs. Social Media Facades

*   He describes his extensive research into market data, contrasting it with the superficial pursuits of some traders: "rent cars to rent Villas the rent and say we live there on social media."
*   He says that “Most of you would never do that because you want to do the next move, I ain’t got time for that. ICT ain’t nobody got time for that”
*   He shares a hypothetical scenario of falsely promising an easy trading day and the potential backlash if the market behaves poorly.

### Managing Expectations: Tough Mornings and Chop

*   He highlights his honest approach: "this morning I said that we're going to have a very tough morning lower your expectations."
*   He says, "my long-term students know exactly what that means: chop slop."
*   He contrasts this with "the salad days" where trading is easy, but emphasizes that "it ain't happening yet."
*   He connects impulsive trading to the pressure of social media, stating, "you're taking your impulsiveness about needing to make more money to keep up with the social media people you're trying to keep up with."
*   He states that “I'm the type of guy to tell you it's hard for everybody and when we can anticipate these things being difficult it's not a guess these things repeat these rules are there for you to anticipate when it's going to be hard.”

### Sideline Strategy: Avoiding the Chop

*   He advocates for sitting out difficult market conditions: "those are the times when you don't risk a lot or don't trade at all."
*   He states what they do is “anticipate the morning is going to be sloppy, let it go and do whatever it’s going to do who cares.”
*   He confidently asserts that many online traders are struggling in the current market: "I promise you you probably know five people online they're kicking themselves because they went in today."
*   He notes that this type of advice is missing from most books and mentorships: "this is the stuff that should be in books but it isn't, this is the stuff that should be in mentorships but isn't outside of mine."

### The One-Day Account Blow-Up: A Common Pitfall

*   He highlights that many traders blow their accounts in a single day due to poor decisions: "everybody blows their account on a one day event, one day something happens."
*   He describes a scenario of escalating risk: "okay it's going to go up no it's going to go down... you're not going to use a stop you're going to over leverage."
*   He warns that this leads to "death by a thousand paper cuts," ultimately draining the account.
*   He emphasizes his efforts to prevent this: "I'm doing everything I can to teach you how to avoid that."

### The War Scar Trap: Avoiding a False Badge of Honor

*   He cautions against romanticizing losses as a "war scar," wishing he could have avoided his own past mistakes.
*   He highlights the advantage his students have: "you have all the advantages now," but they may not see it due to impatience.
*   He says "welcome to the reality some days in the marketplace it's impossible for you to make money and that's a chapter that's going to be in my book."

### The Secret to Longevity: Acknowledging Unwinnable Days

*   He reveals a core concept for long-term survival: "the days that you cannot make money in nobody else wants to write it I'm gonna do it."
*   He admits that "flipping a quarter can be profitable" with good fund management.
*   He poses a rhetorical question regarding how to hurt yourself, “you’re going to push hard in this type of climate right here you’re going to push real real hard but it’s going to finally move really how do you know that because I don’t.”

### A Challenge to Doubters: Find a Profitable Trader in These Conditions

*   He challenges anyone who claims to be consistently profitable in the current market conditions to prove it: "if they know how to trade this environment right here and they're profitable and he had not drawn down significantly I will be their student go find them."
*   He says “they’re not out there they’re getting chopped up they’re going to show you something after the fact they’re not going to tell you this is going to act like this and behave like this.”

### Afternoon Expectations: Awaiting Potential Movement

*   He reiterates his expectations for the afternoon session: "I really like that fair value gap on the dollar Index I mentioned earlier I see dollar going up there and then that sell side at 71 75 on ES I see both of those things happening."
*   However, he is not committed to trading it: "because I don't know I'm not interested."
*   He advocates for taking time away from the charts: "I'm going to go take time away from charts and spend it with my wife I'm gonna go have lunch with my wife."

### Detachment and Prioritizing Well-being

*   He emphasizes the importance of detaching from the market: "I don't feel like I have to be chained to this charts like you do as a new Trader new student."
*   He is content knowing that even if "there might be a big move after I leave," he can find opportunities on easier days.

### The Necessity of Difficult Environments for Learning

*   He explains that learning requires experiencing difficult conditions: "you can't learn properly at least from me without me taking you in these environments like this."
*   He admits that it's not always exciting: "it sucks because you want to see big runs and entry called and targets hitting and just easy fast runs."
*   He insists that he "can't materialize that" if the market is unfavorable, and that "you can't force it."

### Permission to Disconnect: Breaking the Chain

*   He directly addresses struggling traders: "you feel like you just got to stay in front of the charts no you don't I'm telling you you got permission turn them off."
*   He reminds them that "there's far better days out there in your career," so there's no need to force trades on a difficult day.

### The Frustration of Forcing Trades: A Personal Memory

*   He reflects on his own past frustrations of forcing trades in unfavorable conditions.
*   He says, "I remember how frustrated it was for me forcing trying to force something in this environment when it does things like this where nothing none of my pdaras are being respected none of them."
*   He describes a clear metric for identifying bad trading days, “If three of them fail, I'm not interested.”

### Clear Logic, Not Ambiguity: Specific and Measurable

*   He explains that there is a specific logic to avoid the situation “is it continuously giving you feedback that the order flow is bullish or is it bearish if it's not giving you continuous ongoing feedback that you are on side with your expectations that means it's not performing like you want to stay out”

### The Promise of Future Opportunities: Big Moves Are Coming

*   He reassures listeners that better opportunities are ahead: "you'll be able to stay in the game long enough when we have these easy days and they are coming folks."
*   He acknowledges that “The market will not stay like this it'll unravel boom big big big moves will be coming fast Market moves large ranges that are sustained that's coming.”

### The Danger of Fear: Limber vs. Scar Tissue

*   He warns against letting bad experiences create fear: "if you beat yourself up in these conditions like this you're going to be afraid to engage when it's like that when you're supposed to be engaging."
*   He uses a unique metaphor to describe this, “Now you have scar tissue that doesn't have elasticity you got to stay limber why am I doubting is there a word limber I'm doubting it I even exists but isn't at this point there you go you got to stay Nimble and flexible and you have to be willing to cut bait on days like this cut bait means you're done.”

### A Divided Day Strategy: AM/PM Assessment

*   He outlines a simple strategy for managing difficult days: "I have a divided day so the am session blows no problem I'm done I'll come back at 15 minutes to two New York local time and I'll study and look at the price if it doesn't show me anything that I like by 2 30 I'm not spending the rest of the day and not even the last hour."

### Managing Your Business: Time and Focus

*   He stresses that trading is a business and should be managed accordingly: "it helps you manage your business."
*   He discourages aimless chart-watching: "just because there's Market hours open you don't want to be sitting here plunking yourself down in front of the charts."
*   He says “the longer you sit in front of them the more convinced that you see these ink blots as a Rorschach that tells you to get in and you regret it all the time I promise you if you blown accounts before it's been like this you've done that to yourself in these environments”

### Desired Content: Conditions and How to Avoid Them

*   He acknowledges that this live stream may not be "sexy," but it provides crucial information on "these types of conditions and how to avoid them."
*   He says, “and when you lose money and you lose money and you lose money and you're obsessively compulsive one of two things are going to happen you're going to check out permanently and I didn't hear me to do that or you're gonna dig your heels in and say damn it I will crack this and I'm gonna figure it out and that's what my life was that's how you're hearing me now all the bad things made me who I am all that rough stuff that beat me up ground me down I learned from that to become where I am right now.”

### The Legacy of Learning: Bad Things Make You Who You Are

*   He concludes by acknowledging that "everybody that makes money with the stuff that I've taught," has overcome similar challenges.


## Concluding Remarks: Benefactors, Credit, and Tomorrow's Plan

*   The speaker expresses resentment towards those who teach his methods without giving him credit: "they're benefactors to the things that I had to endure and that's why I get pissed off when people try to teach it don't give me credit because you don't deserve it period."
*   He announces plans for the next live stream: "so hopefully tomorrow when we do our next live stream I'll be with you again at 9 15."
*   He anticipates repeating the **Silver Bullet** exercise: "and we'll try to do the uh the exercise again at between 10 o'clock and 11 o'clock that way you can see does in fact the Silver Bullet exists on a Friday."
*   He notes the potential impact of news events: "we have some news again tomorrow so that might move around a little bit as well."

## Homework Assignment: Studying Market Ranges

*   He assigns homework focused on studying market ranges: "but your homework assignment for today is to study and see if we move outside of this range."
*   He provides specific levels to watch: "we got to get below significantly below this low and below this Fairbank Gap or above the high of the new week opening Gap okay."

## Bullish Scenario: Targeting 4104

*   He outlines a bullish scenario: "if if we were to expand above the new week opening Gap I'm looking for 4104. okay so 4104 if we get above the new week open again."
*   He emphasizes the need for confirmation: "that doesn't mean just trading above it and therefore it's going there it needs to trade above it treat it as support and then run higher."
*   He predicts a potential target: "if it does that I would expect 4104 as a drone liquidity for the PM session."

## Bearish Scenario: Gravitating Downwards

*   He presents a bearish scenario: "if we break below the Fairbank Gap here then I think that we're going to gravitate down to the sell side over here not just here that's my expectation."
*   He reiterates his timeframe for action: "and if I don't see things that would support that idea before 2 30 New York local time I'm not doing anything in the last hour trading."
*   He summarizes his expectations: "so that's that's what I'm doing that's what I'm expecting that's how I see it."
*   He is sitting out: "I'm not touching it right here okay."

## Encouragement: Trust, Time, and Predictable Days

*   He encourages listeners to trust themselves: "so hopefully you got something out of this hopefully it inspired you to trust yourself and give yourself a little bit more time knowing that these days can be predicted and not fall victim to them."
*   He highlights the **Silver Bullet**'s performance: "you saw the Silver Bullet idea paying out it was better than five handles."
*   He clarifies that profitability doesn't require being precisely correct: "and it didn't have to be correct about where I thought it was going to go to this sell side."
*   He stresses that it's about points of reference: "sell side as I talked many times before they are points of reference where the market can gravitate to to it's not it has to go there it can go there later on in the day that's when you're right okay."
*   He reinforces the importance of profitability over being "right": "but you don't need to be right in your trade you need to be profitable and you need to be able to get out when it gives you five handles."

## Simplicity and Diligence: Rule-Based Trading

*   He emphasizes the simplicity of his approach: "it's easy folks but everybody else is trying to say it's complicated it's not complicated it's very simple rule-based ideas."
*   He underlines the need for diligence: "but you have to be diligent you have to have the rules written out understood known and stick to them."
*   He claims adherence to rules makes it easy: "then if you stick to them it isn't hard it isn't complicated."

## Deviation and Bias: Potential Complications

*   He cautions against deviating from his suggestions: "but when you deviate outside of them and go against what I'm suggesting is a bias then obviously it is hard then it is complicated."
*   He explains he has already accounted for what the market will do: "but I'm not complicated when you go against what I'm suggesting the Market's likely to do."

## Closing Remarks: Until Tomorrow, Be Safe

*   He concludes with a farewell: "so until talk to you tomorrow enjoy the rest of your day be safe."

# Market Analysis and Trading Strategy: A Detailed Breakdown

## Introduction

Good morning, folks. Thank you for your patience. I needed to grab a bottle of water that I forgot. As a reminder...

**Twitter Volume Check**: If you're following me on Twitter, please give me a 5x5 if the volume is okay. Thank you, Mel and everyone else. I usually see people complaining about low volume on Twitter. I don't know what to do to make it louder except tell you to turn your device up. Everything I have here is set to the highest volume.

## Key Levels and Market Overview

Throughout this week, I've been highlighting the **4104.75 level** as an upside draw if we got animation to the upside.

### New Day Opening Gap

*   We've seen price come down into our **new day opening Gap**, which is located [on the chart]. This is the close at 5:00 PM, and we open at 6:00 PM. This gap is the new day opening Gap.
*   **Importance**: You want to have this on your charts as it acts much like a new week opening Gap.
*   The level here is basically the midpoint or consequent encouragement of the new day opening Gap that started last evening (my local time).
*   Price rallied, took out buy side, traded back down to consequent correction of an *old* new week opening Gap (this was previously misidentified as the present new week opening Gap).

### Opening Range Gap High

*   **Opening Range Gap High**: This is the opening price at 9:30 AM.
*   Yesterday, I mistakenly stated this was at 9:00 AM because I was busy setting things up before the stream.

## Upcoming Holiday Week and Social Media Absence

Next week begins what many call Easter. I call it Passover. I'm not Jewish, but I do observe it.

*   **Market Expectation**: I'm looking to see if we expand up into that 4104.75 level. If animation on the upside takes us into 4115, 4119.5...
*   **Market Behavior**: We've been one-sided all this week since Tuesday.
*   **Observation**: It'll be interesting to see how they close this trading week going into a holiday week.
*   **Upcoming Break**: I will not be doing any Twitter, YouTube, or anything with social media next week. I will be completely away from all social media, including emails and communications with old students.
*   **Reason**: I am resting, celebrating, and observing the Passover.

## Today's Trading Strategy: Silver Bullet Setup

*   **Objective**: This morning, we're looking for an opportunity to observe between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM to see if we can get a **silver bullet setup**. I'll walk you through it as we enter that time.
*   **Current Status**: Right now, we're just waiting for price to mark time until we get into that hour.
*   **Analysis Tool**: Volume and balance on a four-minute chart.

### Important Considerations

*   **Anchoring**: I'm anchored at the 9:30 AM opening price (the opening range Gap High).
*   **Caution**: Be careful when you have price action like this, where we've already pressed up overnight. We created a run at the 8:30 AM news, pushed above it with this high, created another swing high above that one, and now we've created another high above *that* one.
*   **Friday Market Conditions**: You've got to be real careful on a Friday where the market's been one-sided.
*   **4104.75**: Even though I like 4104.75, we could see some kind of a move lower here that would be attacking some measure of sell side (near-term sell side would be right below this lower level).

## Dollar Index (DXY) Analysis

*   **Potential**: The dollar Index looks like we could see a run to 102.25. There's sell side resting below that.
*   **Implication**: This gives allowance for further upside on ES.
*   **Short-Term Risk On**: I like how the dollar Index on the five-minute chart (DXY symbol on TradingView) slots out of balance (buy selling efficiency).
*   **Key Candle**: The big five-minute down close candle at 8:30 AM.
*   **Recent Price Action**: We came back up into that at the 9:05 and 9:10 candles and have been heavy since then.
*   **Current Level**: Trading softer from 102.40. Sell side resting right at round 102.25.
*   **Level Watch**: This level is what I'm watching to see if we get any further animation.
    *   **Problem Scenario**: If it goes below it and then rejects it, that's going to be problematic for continuation on the upside for ES.
    *   **Positive Scenario**: If we just wash out the 102.25 level and crane towards the 102.15-102.10 level, we could see north of 4104 on ES again.

## Strategy Focus: 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM Setup

*   **Goal**: The focus is the setup that forms between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM for a five-handle run.
*   **Student Advice**: This is something I teach my students to start with.
*   **Guidance**: Begin there. Don't try to hit home runs in this price action, even though it's respecting levels that I teach.
*   **Market Condition**: It's a little *wonky* this morning (meaning not really pretty or nice).
*   **Shared Experience**: This entire week has been a little wonky in my opinion.
*   **Comfort**: If you had a little bit of difficulty this week, it's okay. You're in good company. Most everybody else had the same feeling.

## The Week Ahead and Future Plans

*   **Focus**: While we're waiting for the 10:00 AM hour to begin, start hunting our third eye Gap setup.
*   **Expectation**: There will be a silver bullet.
*   **Speculation**: You're probably wondering what I'm going to be doing next week and you're running bets (e.g., "He's going to do a space," "He's going to tweet").
*   **Certainty**: I *won't*, and you will lose that bet.
*   **Complete Disconnect**: I won't even know what's going on. I'm not even going to look at YouTube or any social media whatsoever.
*   **Activities**: I'll be reading Bible study, spending time with friends and family, and traveling.
*   **Connectivity**: We won't be connected to the internet per se. My cell phone will be off in my drawer.
*   **Goal**: I won't have any kind of enticement to look at anything social media.
*   **Exception**: That doesn't remove the TikTok onslaught that my wife likes to show me.

## Re-examining the Dollar Index

*   **Current Status**: The dollar Index is still gravitating towards that 102.25 sell side on the five-minute chart.
*   **Sell Side**: There's sell side resting below 102.10.
*   **Scenario**: If we animate on the downside on the dollar Index, that could be a little bit of an injection of strength to the upside for ES.
*   **Objective**: Getting that 4104.75 level.
*   **Focus**: How we trade *to* it and how we trade *once we trade* it is what I'm watching.

## Finding the 4104.75 Level

*   **Instructions**: For those of you who are wondering where the 4104.75 level comes from, pull up your daily chart for ES M2023 on TradingView.
*   **Date**: Go to March 6, 2023.
*   **Method**: There's a premium wick (the wick that's above the candle). Split that in half, and you'll be able to see that those consequent encouragement.
*   **Action**: Take a moment to find it yourself.
*   **Disclaimer**: Don't be lazy and just wait for me to do it. You've got to learn how to do this yourself.
*   **No Indicators**: There's no indicator that plots this stuff down here. I do everything old school.

## Old School Trading Philosophy

*   **Preference**: I like everything typed out. I don't want an indicator to plot that stuff for me.
*   **The Secret**: The levels are really written on [a] notepad.
*   **Organization**: All the levels that I am interested in, all the ones that's noted on this chart, I have them in numerical format, just in the order of importance.
*   **Daily Routine**: When I start the day, I write down the opening price in relationship to the hierarchy of all these price levels here.
*   **Future Skill**: At some point, once you understand what you're looking for, you really don't need a chart.
*   **Advanced Technique**: You can just trade off of quotes coming to you.
*   **Caution**: I don't advise you do that if you're new and you don't know what you're doing.
*   **Time-Based Trading**: When you understand time, you can trade just off of that.

## Current Market Action

*   **Dollar Index**: So far, the dollar Index hasn't really made its way into that 102.25 level just yet.
*   **Potential**: It might be wanting to rebalance that little area that's created on the most recent five-minute candlestick that we're now forming after.
*   **Gap Watch**: In other words, that tiny little space on the 9:50 five-minute candle on DXY, up to the low of the previous candle (five-minute candle 9:45), with the low of 102.29.
*   **Ideal Scenario**: It would be nice to see that small little Gap that's still there remain there, and then animations on the downside.
*   **Target**: I'd like to see 102.10 breached and get below 102 for dollar.

## Afternoon Session Prediction

*   **Likely Outcome**: I think the afternoon session today from 2:30 PM to 4:00 PM will probably be very busy.
*   **Expectation**: You'll probably see a lot of nice price swings.

## Personal Life and Streaming Schedule

*   **Question**: Why didn't you live stream that?
*   **Reason**: I have a wife that tells me that she needs my attention on her and family at specific times, and she's calling the shots on that.

## Monitoring Dollar Index and Market Indicators

*   **Action**: Watch your dollar digging into that 102.25 sell side now.
*   **Time Check**: It's 10:01 AM.
*   **Dollar Index Movement**: Just went underneath the low on that five-minute candlestick for sell side on DXY.
*   **Limited Expansion**: Did not get any kind of expansion below it, only one tick below it.
*   **Gap Observation**: Back inside that little Gap I mentioned.
*   **Level Watch**: Watch the 102.29 level on dollar.
*   **Agreement**: So far, everything's agreeing on that higher high for the three indices.
*   **Confirmation**: As that confirms the higher high, Dow has confirmed a higher high.

### Index Comparison

*   **Procedure**: I'll cycle through those right now so we can see it.
*   **Currently Viewing**: We're on ES right now on a one-minute chart.
*   **Focus**: We're looking at the relationship comparatively and respectively with these higher highs here.
*   **Next Index**: We'll look at NASDAQ first.
    *   **NASDAQ Result**: You've had higher highs there in the Dow.
    *   **Dow Result**: Oops, and higher highs in the Dow.
*   **Assessment**: We haven't had any kind of indication of waning sponsorship across all the three indices.

## Market Condition Assessment

*   **Reminder**: Again, we don't try to pick tops.
*   **Analysis**: When I'm looking at Price like this, and pretty much this entire week really...
*   **Volatility**: See all the give and take back and forth in here.
*   **Pattern**: See how it's back and forth, back and forth, but still gravitating towards levels that we can anticipate seeing them traded to.
*   **Entry Point Quality**: But it doesn't give us a real clean area of "This is where I would like to enter."
*   **Ideal Scenario**: This is a very low risk, high probability entry.
*   **Current Description**: When I see price action like this, I refer to it as being *spotty*.
*   **Characteristics**: It's a little too messy, it's not precise, it's not allowing for precision.
*   **Outcome**: It may have a Hallmark of going to levels that we talk about and what I've been referring to all this week.
*   **Caveat**: Just because it goes to that level doesn't mean that it's offered us a, or at least let me speaking personal terms, it hasn't offered me a whole lot of precise entry points this week.
*   **Adaptation**: When it's like that, you have to be very patient. Don't demand a whole lot because the market's going to do what it's going to do regardless.
*   **Clear Signals**: If it's not presenting it to you in a manner that is very obvious where it's one-sided, you can clearly see an inefficiency, you can clearly see a run-on stops and then expect it to go the other direction, I don't, I haven't seen that much of that this week.
*   **Conclusion**: If you've been studying it, looking at it, or trying to paper trade or whatever, and you've had adversities that you feel are not common, it's because of what I'm outlining here. It's been a very difficult week for Price delivery. It's real spotty, it's real just messy.

## DXY and Price Action Expectations

*   **Dollar Index**: Dollar's gonna need to make its lower lows in here, it's going to do it. Otherwise, it wouldn't bang inside the 102.25–102.41 range (five-minute chart).
*   **Observation**: Respect over. I don't like this.
*   **Pattern Recognition**: See how you can draw an imaginary trend line (diagonal support)?
*   **Dislike**: I don't like that at all.
*   **Interpretation**: My lines look real clean like that. I don't like that meaning that it could easily just Spike down in here and upset that smoothness that would be considered diagonal support, which I don't have any faith in.
*   **Commitment**: I already know that this 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM hour is going to be formidable in terms of finding the Silver Bullet setup.
*   **Plan**: I'm committed to spend the entire hour with you and outline it as I see it.
*   **Disclaimer**: Do not push the button. Don't copy it. Don't try to go in and do something with your live account or your funded account or your challenge that you want to be in your combine.

## Forex Pair Analysis for Risk Assessment

*   **Objective**: I'm looking across 4X pairs to see if I get a better read on risk on/risk off.
*   **EUR/USD**: Euro dollar has a little bit of buy side on the five-minute chart just above 1.0895.
*   **Proximity**: It's got real close to cleaning up that 5:00 AM short term high.
*   **GBP/USD**: Pound dollar, it's a bit of a mess on that one, I'm sorry 1.24 even there's buy side there.
*   **Potential**: If we can get that one up to 1.25 to give up the ghost on dollar on those those areas could be treated to.
*   **Range Acknowledgement**: It's not much of a range admittedly.
*   **Summary**: But that's what I see on the Forex front.

## Index Specific Analysis

*   **Dow Jones**: The Dow looks really, and I'm gonna be very careful saying this, but it looks very toppy, looks very like it's run out of steam on the upside.
*   **Caution**: You gotta be careful on days like this because it can still pump up there and usually make it a larger extension to the upside where it just, you don't expect a big range move come in, and they deliver it.
*   **General Sentiment**: We're kind of just wherever you all.

## Real-Time Monitoring and Execution Challenges

*   **Dollar Index**: Dollar Index trying for that 102.25 level to wash that out more prominently.
*   **Trading View Setup**: I don't know what the membership level for TradingView is that you need to have to get two charts side by side, I don't know offhand what that is because I have the highest form of whatever they offer.
*   **Disclaimer**: I don't get any kind of Kickback, I'm not trying to tell you to buy anything from TradingView.
*   **Recommendation**: But it would be advantageous for you to have a dollar index chart and the chart you're watching, whatever Mark that being if it's a Forex pair, it still works, if it's an index, like ES, that we're focusing on.
*   **Benefit**: That way, you can measure real time the relationships of risk on/risk off.
*   **Washout Confirmation**: There we go, we got that washout on the sell side we're looking for for dollar Index.
*   **Corresponding Movement**: Really, this should be having a run above that 4104 on ES.
*   **Currency Pair Movement**: And there's euro dollar running into the buy side I mentioned and cable still hanging around and trying to do much at all.

## ES Volatility and Sentiment

*   **Price Action**: So far in ES, it looks like he wants to upset that trend line I was talking about.
*   **Assessment**: Trendline fandom, tough read in terms of trying to do an execution, let's put it that way.
*   **Key Question**: So the first question now that we're in 10:00 AM hour is where is the draw?
*   **Key Question**: Where do we want to see it repriced to?
*   **Analogy**: Because without that, we're like a sailboat without a rudder.
*   **Outcome**: I mean, we don't have any way of navigation. We'll just be at the mercy of the tide of or current.
*   **Conclusion**: Admittedly, nothing at the moment really jumps off the chart to me, which is one of the reasons why I said moments ago that this is going to be a difficult one for me. But Natalia sometimes.

## Dollar Index Examination and Analysis

*   **Goal**: So we have that wick on dollar Index lasted wick on a finance chart, you want to get consequent encouragement on the 3:00 AM candle.
*   **Execution**: Split that in half, we're trading there now.
*   **Expectation**: Any animation to the downside gravitates towards 102.10.
*   **Level**: And then the sell side resting below it, 102.04.
*   **Analysis**: So now think about like this, in all this movement here in price, there's really no inefficiencies in here to operate off of and each new high has been posting a new high and then pulling back down into the range for no purpose.
*   **Personal Perspective**: That makes sense to me looking at the chart.
*   **Analysis Process**: And where do you go in, this is the internal dialogue I'm holding right now with myself, where do I go in and then frame the risk, like where would my stop need to be?
*   **Obstacle**: I can't, I can't define it where it's low probability, I'm sorry, high probability low risk when everything really is.


## Market Analysis and Trading Strategy: Continued

### Low Probability and High-Risk Assessment

The current market conditions are presenting a challenge. We haven't seen anything concrete that makes sense to me, it is still early in the 10:00 AM hour only 13 minutes in.

*   **Obviousness**: It has to be obvious where the market wants to reach for.
*   **Upside Potential**: Right now, the only liquidity and reason to draw higher is that consequent encouragement of the daily chart on March 6th.
*   **Conditional Upside**: I see that as a potential upside to be traded to *if* the dollar Index rejects going lower.

### Potential Short Setup

I'm going to pose the argument for looking for a short, *not* that there is one yet.

*   **Conditions for a Short**: If we displace lower and create a fair value Gap in here, that could set the stage for a short.
*   **Target**: Whatever fair value gap if there is one.
*   **Opening Price Target**: It will trade down into the opening price at 9:30, which is 4090.25.
*   **Current State**: No follow-through, no imbalance, no inefficiencies.

### Market Displacement

The market has to do something in the form of displacement where it just shows like it tips its hand to you, and it hasn't done so yet. You have to be very patient.

*   **Knowledge is Key**: Knowing what you're looking for makes it easier to wait.
*   **New Trader Challenges**: When you don't know what you're waiting for, you're afraid that something's going to jump off the chart and run away, but you won't be able to see that coming.
*   **Reacting vs. Anticipating**: New Traders chase price because they don't know what they're looking for or waiting for. They dogpile in on a move that's already underway.
*   **Stop Loss Issues**: They don't know where to put their stop loss or they don't use a stop loss. Any realistic retracement in the initial run will scare them out.

### 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM Strategy

We're anticipating, we're looking for something that we understand is likely to form between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM.

*   **Requirement**: It needs to be one-sided and have an obvious reason to go One Direction or the other.
*   **Dollar Index Status**: So far, we've not seen the dollar Index continue lower below that 3 AM low.
*   **Current Action**: We do have a small little city that it's working inside of on the five-minute dollar chart now. That candles the 10:05.

### Mentorship Insights and Market Conditions

Part of this year's mentorship is putting you in these conditions and watching price when it's *not* easy. It's helpful even though you may feel like it's counterproductive. It's very helpful to you to get a baseline understanding about what it's like when you don't really want to be Trading.

*   **The Danger Zone**: These are the environments and the conditions you don't want to push it.
*   **Past Mistakes**: If you go back and look at your losing trades or where you've blown your account, it's when it's like this, and you just toss in through a mental breakdown and psychological fatigue of just waiting for something to happen.
*   **Lottery Mindset**: What's going to happen if I push the button and enter right here? I might get lucky and you start trading with a lottery mindset that's gambling.
*   **Clarity Required**: It has to make sense, it has to be in the chart clearly one-sided, or you don't push a button.

### Permission to be on the Sidelines

If something happens and the market moves and you weren't part of it, it's okay.

*   **Prior Missed Moves**: It moved this morning at 8:30 without me. It moves overnight again without me.
*   **Current Week**: Most of this entire weekly range, even though I was looking for higher prices, it moved without me. I didn't have an area where I could really engage well with it.
*   **Clean Setup**: You have to demand that the Market's going to provide you rather a setup that's clean.
*   **Logical Context**: It has to make sense logically within the context of your model.
*   **Risk Management**: It has to make sense from a risk standpoint.

### Arguing Both Sides of the Trade

You have to be able to frame the risk in arguing the other side of the trade is a difficult task if you can argue both sides which is what we're saying essentially here because it hasn't done anything in this choppiness here it could still go up and hit the 4104.75 level.

*   **Level Definition**: Which is consequent encouragement of March 6 daily candle premium Wick.
*   **Wick Assessment**: So half of the wick, that's what that level is here and I said I would show you that.
*   **Premium vs Discount Wicks**: When it's above the candle, it's a Premium lick. When it's below the candle, it's a discount.

### Price Action Assessment

Does anything in this Inspire action on your part and I'm not talking about impatience or gambling the impulsiveness that just get in there and do it because some of you are thinking I'm probably going to be right about that 410 4.75 so why not just buy here and get five handles of a run.

*   **Risk Framing**: Where are you framing your risk whereas the stop loss going to be at because I don't know where I would be putting that and feel like it's safe and not the static price action that we're seeing back and forth.
*   **Spotty Price Action**: This is spotty price action to me.
*   **Lack of Signature**: It's just back and forth. It's not trying to get anywhere in a hurry which is one of the Hallmarks this is a signature to what I'm trying to trade all the examples when you see me recording them and getting involved in these price moves and pyramiding and building positions up larger six contracts three contracts one contract building up and then it goes to my targets and it quickly runs down there you're not seeing that in this price action and you're hearing me explain why it's not likely to be that type of trade it's not likely to be that kind of session yet all that can change in in an instant all it needs to do is displace dollar Index has failed to go lower we're in an area right now where it could revisit the equilibrium of the range that's been formed on dollars five minute chart if you look at the high at 9 10 to the low that was formed at 10 10.

### Dollar Index Equilibrium

That range split that in half the equilibrium of that range I'll tell you what the prices in a second 102.296 so if it starts to move above that that's problematic for initial upside for ES and that means that we could potentially have a AM session inmate turn High here displacement lower that creates a fair value Gap I would feel confident that we would then at that time trade to the opening range Gap High which is the 9 30 opening price candles opening price.

*   **Opening Price Reminder**: See this up here in the upper left-hand Corner o That's the opening price on this candle that opening price is 4090.25.
*   **Dollar Index and ES Inverse Relationship**: So if dollar can manage to get above 102 point we'll just call it 102.30 if it starts to move above that that's problematic on continuation on the upside for ES we would wait submit ourselves the time and wait for a displacement lower and if there's a fair value Gap that's what I'm looking for that move otherwise I'm sitting still because it might just want to spike up ended up 4104.75 and then I have to wait for more information this type of price action is what I expect on the week like next week that this is this is typical of what I expect during those types of holidays you might not celebrate it but the a lot of big money does and you'll probably see some wonky price action next week as well and you probably might see several price action moves that are just amazing it's okay they'll be there when I come back.
*   **Next Live Stream**: First live stream after today will be April 11th.

### Current Market Status

Dollar Index is just underneath that 102 30 level as I mentioned anything above that that's problematic for ES going higher Euro dollars rejecting its 109. a big figure and cable just never joined the party on the upside so even this I don't see anything I could work with for Forex either.

### Live Streaming Challenges and Skill Set

Let's cycle through the indices and I guess this is one of those times when people that do live streaming all the time this is probably where they feel the impulsiveness to feel like they have to do something for Their audience whereas myself I don't care if you're bored or you watch the stream and nothing happens because that's the real world you're going to have times when you have a model when you know what you're looking for you're just going to wait for the model that let's type the same thing talking and doing things on this is something that's outside the scope of my skill set apparently can't walk into bubble gum so damn that's ugly isn't it.

*   **Dow Analysis**: Somewhat of an imbalance still in here we're looking at the Dow by the way so one minute chart it would need to stay above that area there that's a mitigation block by the way.
*   **The Priceless Skill**: Knowing when to sit still there's a skill set that is Priceless you can't put a price tag on that knowing when to sit still.

### Real-Time Market Observations

Dollar Index is traded above that equilibrium price point I told you about that would be problematic so we're watching es to see if it shuns that 4104 levels for now and wants to go lower or does it Spike up there and reject it and then reprice lower their short term buy side risk thing right above here so they could be coming up there bumping that and it hit the 4104 and three quarters level which is constant approachment of the wick on March 6th daily candle British pound versus US dollar has moved lower 20 handles 20 Pips 20 Pips apologize just in Striking Distance on that 4104.75 level dollar is still expanding to the upside so this is in my opinion is a suspect rally meaning that it's probably just bumping the buy side and then potentially rejection still give an opportunity for 4104 to be traded to so even though that the market is being very fickle right now typical meaning that it's just not cooperating allowing really nice clean price runs and setups we can see like I mentioned on the dollar Index how that's likely to pull up and Forex offered 20 Pips on both the Euro and cable es is just being stubborn still there's that buy side it just punked into that so this is halfway decent so far if we can break down below that and not get crazy on the downside we can use this as a breaker so we would have high low higher high taking out buy side so East these two candles here we would extend that out in the future as a rectangle and then we would see it maybe offer resistance there but it would need to trade below it to do so um now the dollar was to just completely lose where it's at right now and go lower that 4119 level on yes that would be something doesn't have a buy side here by something about cell sign efficiency shift in Market structure even though 4104 I like we trade through that here at this shaded area by the way which we probably wondering what is that the Shaded area is a volume and balance on the daily chart and this is the March 6th High daily High problem with this one is we have to dial lagging which it can keep I told you it would need to stay above here it's going to be worse the trades below it that would be uh week NASDAQ higher ES volume and balance do that all the time different platforms different rules you know off that the volume balance I'm gonna run on that so 4108 and a half that level right there off the volume of balance let's just just underneath the movie five handles if you were using that to find the balance.
*   **Dollar Index Watch**: I'm looking at dollar Index to see if it wants to slip hard here lower NASDAQ is leading the way on the upside BS and Dow and lagging cf41 4108 50 can print dollar Index is still consolidating euro is slipping lower pound dollar slipping lower so we have a mixed bag this morning NASDAQ just ripped up higher Dallas still failed to make a higher high respectively so let's see if we can book that 4108.50 level before I toggle to a different screen in dollars still trying to move higher while this is pressing into new highs of day not a good thing.

### Comparative Index Analysis

Let's cycle through real quick lower high ER High leader among the averages so it's more strong stronger than uh the other two down and yes respectively and here's yes so yes has hit our 4104.75 level went above it a little bit dollar has not went lower endow is slipping with a lower high lots of stops have been trailed up to here now so we now have sell side resting below there to imagine overnight longs they rode out the rally here this thought would have been Trail below here and then here and all of this consolidation in here they see that as support so they're going to run their sell side more cell stops resting right below that and hoping to catch you know further upside so there's lots of liquidity resting right here.

*   **Liquidity Analysis**: I don't need a book map or heat map or whatever that gimmick stuff that other people might use to see where liquidity May reside you can see it in The Narrative of price delivery it's basically price action 101 you don't need a a tool to have additional attention spent on you got to keep your eye on price action if you're looking at anything else that will take your potentially from the Open high loan clothes and the delivery of price you're by looting your attention and your focus in that small little micro fraction of a distraction is just enough for you to miss the entry and then be upset that you missed your entry it completely has a a horrible effect on them on the day's performance even if you romantic to be profitable after that.
*   **Time Check**: It's 10:40.
*   **Dow Performance**: Dallas does not supporting any of this Assad yeah once I go for another higher high and dollar indexes is not helping at all just hanging around at the equilibrium or above it rather of that five minute dealing range when it's morning session apart from the dollar and I'm sorry yeah apart from the dollar not helping much here in the Dow being in the laggard this would be the setup from here up into the 4108 and a half and the volume and balance supporting it here so while that's not a fair value Gap that'll be supporting it but I don't have to the dial behind me I don't have the dollar Index so that makes this a very low probability setup but we'll watch it nonetheless.

### Conclusion

Nasdaq's higher high I'll show you all right hi there es's you have to make that higher high and down still the laggard so if you are of the mindset that you just want to look at one chart and not have any kind of inter-market analysis that would support or negata idea that you may be looking to participate in in my opinion it's just you know all that it is it doesn't mean that you know I'm right but I think that you should always try to weigh out


### Market Analysis and Trading Strategy: Continued

#### Filtering Trade Ideas with Inter-Market Analysis

Using other markets to support or negate a trade idea helps filter out lower probability opportunities.

*   In a symmetrical market, ES advancing higher off the **buy-side imbalance** and **volume imbalance** would be supported by a **lower dollar**.
*   **NASDAQ** should have shown a willingness to make a higher high.
*   **Dow Jones** should catch up and go higher, fueling ES's upward movement.

##### Potential Resistance Levels and Scenarios

*   **Stall Gap**: The first potential resistance level.
*   **High**: The next PD (Premium/Discount) array.
*   **Volume Imbalance**: The third resistance level, acting as the last line of defense for the bullish idea.
*   **Consequent Encouragement**: Alternatively, the consequent encroachment of the wick could be considered instead of the volume imbalance.
*   **Preference**: Price should remain above the volume imbalance if it's going to reach 4108-4110.
*   The Dow made a lower advancement and is now rejecting, showing no willingness to go higher.

#### Ultra-High Frequency Trading Strategy

*   Focus on short-term moves.
*   **Fulcrum Point**: Treat recent price action as a fulcrum, adding the movement lower to derive a standard deviation of -1.
*   **Monitoring**: Watch the price movement closely.

#### NASDAQ and Gap Analysis

*   **Gap Integrity**: Note how the bodies of the candles respect the gap.
*   **Troll Observation**: Some might think it's going to crash.
*   **Candle Anatomy**: Bodies tell the story, wicks do the damage.
*   The NASDAQ has the other volume imbalance above the high.
*   **Breakaway Gap**: Treat the gap as a breakaway gap if it stays open, even with wick overlaps. Aim for 4108.
*   Overlapping: Now that it has overlapped it's still acceptable.
*   **PD Array**: The PD array, order block, and gap now need price to stay above them, The bodies need to stay above this gap to properly read order flow.

#### Order Flow and Market Depth

*   **Ladder Depth**: Market DOMs are not necessary to analyze order flow.
*   **Failure Scenario**: If the price breaks below the gap and candle bodies form below it, the near-term bullish outlook is compromised.
*   Dollar Index consolidating in a tight range.

#### Forex Pair Analysis: Euro and Cable

##### Euro Dollar Short Setup

*   **Sell-Side Imbalance Buy-Side Inefficiency (SIBI)**: Euro Dollar traded up into a SIBI.
*   **Short Opportunity**: The SIBI at the 10:25 candle on a five-minute chart presents a short opportunity.
*   **Target**: A return to the smoothed lows at 108.75.
*   **Stop Loss**: Place the stop loss just above 108.63 or 64.
*   The Dow isn't joining the upside.

##### Divergence and Relative Strength

*   **ES vs. NASDAQ**: ES is showing relative strength to the upside, while NASDAQ isn't confirming with a higher high.
*   **Dow Underperformance**: The Dow needs to make a higher high to align.
*   **Dollar Index Impact**: The lack of support from the dollar index makes these trade ideas anemic.

##### Institutional Order Flow Entry Drill

If the market continues higher:

*   **Order Flow Entry**: Use the immediate price action as an institutional order flow entry drill.
*   **Target**: Aim for a run higher.
*   **Alternative Scenario**: If it fails, expect the market to move lower.
*   **Dollar Index**: The Dollar Index has not been helping so far today, a market condition that makes long trades for ES less Ideal

#### Real-Time Market Dynamics and Risk Management

*   **Dollar Strength**: Dollar ranging higher.
*   **Forex Weakness**: Cable diving lower, Euro diving lower right off the mentioned SIBI.
*   **ES Vulnerability**: ES is likely to lose ground due to the aforementioned circumstances.

##### SMT (Smart Money Technique) Diversions and Risk Management

*   **Scenario**: Consider a long position from the volume imbalance or the high.
*   **Action**: If long, take partial profits.
*   **Contingency**: If partials were not taken, close the trade.
*   **Justification**: Cable breaking lower, Euro breaking lower, and dollar rising higher warrant exiting the long position.
*   **Market Interdependence**: It's critical to monitor other markets, especially FX pairs, for risk-on/risk-off signals, even if not trading them directly.
*   **Forex Insight**: Moves in Euro and Cable can provide insights into expected price action in other markets.
*   **Early Warning Signs**: Recognize real-time reversals and warning signs to avoid surprises.

##### Contrarian Views on Intermarket Analysis

*   Some individuals criticize intermarket analysis, advocating for a one-market, one-chart approach.
*   This approach is akin to "wearing blinders."

##### Dollar Index as a Leading Indicator

*   **Risk Sentiment**: The dollar index tips its hand, revealing risk-on or risk-off sentiment.
*   The Dollar Index is about to make a higher high

##### Fair Value Gap and Institutional Workflow

*   **High-Risk Setup**: Playing the high-risk game.
*   **Target**: The Fair Value Gap.
*   **Institutional Workflow Entry Drill**: Watch for a trade to 104.51 (one tick above the candle's high of 104.50). Then, look for it to trade down into sell-side liquidity.
*   **Risk Mitigation**: If this setup is traded, use the least amount of risk and avoid pyramiding.
*   **Rationale**: The reaction in Cable and Euro supports this potential move, even though you might not be a Forex Trader.
*   **Dollar Index Confirmation**: Dollar Index is still higher.
*   **Index Divergence**: NASDAQ failed to make a higher high with ES.
*   **Dow Lag**: The Dow has been the laggard all morning.
*   **Shift in Market Structure**: The preferred shift in market structure hasn't occurred.

##### Contingency Planning and Stop Loss Management

*   **Imbalance Play**: Playing on the idea of an imbalance, having already visited a premium.
*   **Real-Time Assessment**: Evaluating the setup in real time.
*   **Acceptable Outcome**: If stopped out, it reinforces the concept of avoiding such environments.
*   **Market Requirements**: The market should have already moved lower, and if it hasn't, demand more from it.
*   **Trailing stop strategy**: The stop will be above the most recent high for Cable
*   **Failure Indication**: Bodies should remain within the imbalance; any breach suggests a potential failure.
*   **Aborting the Trade**: If the bodies trade outside of the imbalance, abort the trade.

#### Evolution of a Trader's Mindset

*   **The 20-Year-Old Mindset**: The temptation to see a setup pan out, leading to engagement and then widening the stop loss when it doesn't perform as expected.
*   **Opening Stop**: Opening the stop allows a larger loss if the market digs into liquidity above the old high.
*   **Early Signs of Failure**: The market communicated to avoid the higher stop loss if this action occurs.
*   **Body vs. Wicks**: The imbalance here shows that there is unfinished business.
*   **Proactive Risk Management**: Respect the measure of risk.
*   **Signature Assessment**: Respect the measure of risk, if the signatures in price action don't support your idea, then end the setup.
*   **Immediate Delivery**: The trade immediately starts delivering or it doesn't.
*   **First Warning Sign**: Seeing a body like that is your first warning sign.
*   **Confirmation**: A subsequent candle trading higher confirms the failure.
*   **Action**: Abort the trade and move to the sidelines.
*   **Outcome**: You feel better managing risk appropriately, not reacting to price.
*   **Price Narrative**: Let price tell you the story, especially when it has unfinished business above.
*   **Key Principle**: The bodies are not permitted outside of the imbalances.
*   **Proactive Abort**: When one understands that the probabilities have shifted, they can abort the trade before a full stop-out occurs.

#### Inevitable Losses and Continuous Learning

*   **Acceptance**: The market may run for the stop despite analysis, which is a cost of doing business.
*   **No Perfection**: Nobody has a 100% strike rate.
*   **Stop Loss Purpose**: The stop is paid to protect against larger losses.
*   **Trader Responsibility**: Continue watching price action to do a better job of managing risk.
*   **Impact of Understanding**: This is why it's important to listen to these seemingly boring parts because you can now understand how to manage a stop-loss.
*   **Devil's Advocate**: Intentionally talking about why this is low probability.
*   **FX Weakness, Dollar Strength**: Weakness across FX, strength in the dollar, and SMT diversions across the indices are all factors.
*   **NASDAQ vs. ES**: NASDAQ didn't support the ES higher high.
*   The high on the Dow was a single point above so it did technically make a higher high

##### Refining Entry Criteria

*   **Reversal Strategy**: Only look for this run below the low here to trigger selling side liquidity.
*   **Fair Value Gap as Setup**: Look for any imbalance that creates a fair value gap as a setup to go long.
*   **Extended Imbalance**: Extend this imbalance on the chart

#### Post-Trade Analysis and Probabilistic Thinking

*   **Closing Price Significance**: If the algorithm permits a candle to print and close outside the anticipated resistance (imbalance), it's a warning sign.
*   **Actionable Insight**: Don't waste time worrying.
*   **Loss Mitigation**: The trader can see it and understand that there were a shift in the probabilities.


### Navigating Losses and Refining Trading Strategies

#### Minimizing Losses and Protecting Equity

*   **Neutralizing Positions:** Actively neutralize positions to minimize losses, even if it results in a very small loss. This approach is preferable to holding on and risking a full stop-out.
*   **Mindset:** Adopting a proactive approach to limiting risk empowers traders and makes losses more palatable.
*   It's easier to accept a smaller loss when you make the decision to minimize it, rather than passively waiting for a full stop-out to occur.
*   **Trader Development**: Reflect on your trading journey, analyzing how you have handled losses.
*   **Gumption**: How often have you recognized a likely stop-out but hesitated to close the trade?
*   There is nothing wrong with closing a trade to avoid a full stop-out.
*   Treat preserving equity with the same diligence as taking partial profits.
*   **Partials** Pay out 100% of the time, never failing to make a profit when in profit.
*   Preserving equity and limiting risk are equally important.
*   Utilize **PD Arrays**, **Order Flow** analysis, and real-time **Tape Reading** to identify when your positions are in jeopardy.
*   **Proactive Risk Assessment**: With proper analysis, you can identify that your stop is in jeopardy.
*   **Stop Loss Necessity**: There is no need to hold on to a full stop when you have clear indications that your stop is now in jeopardy.
*   **Aborting Trades**: You should never feel bad about aborting a trade and preserving a full stop-out.
*   **New Trader Pitfalls**: Resisting this experience by letting your full stop-out occur or opening the stop to a larger stop-loss is detrimental to your development and longevity as a trader.
*   **Viability Assessment**: You must have a clear reason to know when a trade is no longer viable.
*   **Learning**: If you don't have that reason yet, this year you are learning how to do that.
*   **PD Arrays, Imbalances and Liquidity**: They have a dance between them, and when they don't agree, do not allow full stop loss. Close it.
*   **Comfortable Losses**: You want to be comfortable taking small losses and knowing that you did the right thing by taking a smaller loss than allowing it to be a larger full stop-out, and you'll feel empowered because of that.
*   The market may be set to go one more time higher on ES with the 4109 level from the volume imbalance.
*   **Market Difficulty**: This is a very difficult market to trust because the supporting factors are not materializing in other markets.
*   **Low Probability**: This is what defines a low probability in these types of moves.
*   **Non-Participation**: When these low probability conditions form, I will not be a participant of it.
*   The market will move without me and it's fine.
*   **Mitigating Loss**: Reducing the overall exposure to risk is a paramount issue for your continued or eventual success.

#### Overcoming Fear and Embracing Risk

*   **First Losing Trade**: In the beginning, traders are often afraid to take that first losing trade.
*   **Funded Account**: When you get funded a live account, you're going to be so terrified to take that first trade because you don't want it to start off on the wrong foot of losing trade.
*   **Smallest Leverage**: The smallest amount of leverage that you can put on with flip a quarter. If it's heads you buy, if it's tails you sell short.
*   **Breaking the Ice**: Accept the fact that you get some kind of instigation that's outside of your own decision making that way you can't be blamed emotionally psychologically if it's a losing trade on the first one.
*   **Chance**: Let chance be the first thing.
*   **No Blame**: If it's a losing trade, who cares? You didn't make the decisions so you can't feel bad about them.
*   **Skill**: If it wins, you can't attribute it to skill because you did something outside of yourself.
*   **Paralysis**: The first trade is behind you now; you're not paralyzed like a deer in headlights.
*   **Fear of Losing**: As a student that starts learning how to do this, your number one fear is doing it wrong and losing money.
*   **Mindfulness**: This is something to be mindful of, because nobody really wants to go out here and try to lose money.
*   **Clear Decisions**: You can't allow it to paralyze you where you can't make clear decisions about what it is you're doing with risk.
*   **Assuming Risk**: Risk has to be assumed.
*   There's no way to do this industry and not assume risk.
*   **Disclaimers**: That's why the disclaimers are always there, and you're constantly bombarded with warnings that you can lose more than you have.
*   **Previous Outcomes**: Previous experience and outcomes/results are not indicative of future results.
*   **Subconscious Knowledge**: You subconsciously know this, and you also know the times when you were looking at Price action and it didn't do what you thought it was going to do, and that would have materialized as a losing tree.
*   **Filtering Reality**: But you'll filter that out, you'll pretend that that never happened like you didn't see it, but you really did and your subconscious knows that you may need making no mental note of it.
*   **Emotional Memory**: Subconsciously your emotions and your psyche is remembering that as that's something that triggered you, but you're trying to block it out.
*   **Real Money Trading**: This is the chemistry behind why it's difficult for you.
*   **Demo Trading vs. Live Trading**: You may do it really, really well in a demo or paper trading, then when you go to a live account real risk setting all the things that you did wrong not practicing properly, not managing risk, you have not conditioned yourself or desensitized yourself to doing it wrong and not being tore up because of it.
*   **Inevitable Mistakes**: You're going to do it wrong. Everybody that's going to ever trade in the future will do it wrong.
*   I will do it wrong, you'll do it wrong, but how much skin is going to come off of that?
*   How much flesh is going to be removed from you? How much Equity is it going to consume?
*   **Control**: You have control over that.
*   **Milestones**: If you look at these things and you use them as milestones for intellect, like a winning trade or a series of winning trades means you're smart, it doesn't mean you're smart.
*   It just means that you made the right decisions at that time under those current circumstances.
*   **Risk Definition**: Risk has to be defined all the time, and that initial risk is not limited to that's all it's going to be.
*   You can find ways to limit that even less, but you have to look at Price action.
*   **Marrying Ideas**: You can't just marry the idea because you're now in a trade and you just can't bring yourself to take a losing trade.
*   **Logic**: What happens if I get out of it and it moves in my favor?
*   What happens when you don't listen to the logic I'm teaching you and it smokes you every single time at maximum loss every time?
*   **Liquidity**: If you're offside, means you're in the wrong direction of the market and you have stop loss that's allowing them to take that, you are liquidity and they will consume you.
*   **Learning and Trusting**: When I teach price action, it's important to note that these rules are there for you to learn from and also to trust over time.
*   **Real-Time Experience**: But you can't trust it unless you're in here doing these exercises where you're watching it real time and not being afraid of it not painting in your favor.
*   You need to experience that.
*   **Journaling Emotions**: How are you going to react to that and in journal that are you are you frustrated because even though you're just tape reading it it didn't pan out and how does it make you feel?
*   What's your chemistry like at that moment? Are you hopped up and you're just angry now you want to vent?
*   Do you want to go online and complain?
*   Do you doubt the concepts? Do you doubt yourself ever learning how to do this because of that?
*   All those things there's our 109.50 level in dollar Index is still hanging around near its highs.

#### The "20-Year-Old ICT" Mindset and Risk Mitigation

*   **Opening Stops**: Go back to that 20-year-old ICT; I would have opened my stop up larger.
*   That would have been a larger loss, not reading what I've learned later in life that told me that this is not going to be a good idea.
*   Kill it before it gets there.
*   **Book Learning vs. Practical Wisdom**: How can someone look at that you think that's not a good idea to learn the books don't teach that here's a stop except the risks if you get stopped out.
*   **Trading Clichés**: Trade your plan, plan your trade, and stick to your game plan.
*   **Risk Mitigation**: Well the game plan is not to lose as much money, and if you have a way, a mechanism that helps you limit that, then you should do it.

#### Market Outlook and Trade Ideas

*   **Target Level**: These mugs want to take this up to 4112-4113.
*   **Standard Deviations**: It's two standard deviations on this swing here.
*   The 4109 level, which is negative three and a half on this price swing is inside that shaded area, which is the daily volume imbalance.
*   The 4118 and a half just falls short of it.
*   **Confluence**: There's a lot of things converging around that daily volume imbalance.
*   **Afternoon Bias**: As long as we stay above this here into the afternoon, this is where I think we'll go.
*   **Trading Below Low**: The only thing that changes that is trading below this low here.
*   **Analyst Condition**: Now I framed out the afternoon bias for you and what would be necessary for those things to be true for me as an analyst.
*   **Devil's Advocate**: So I forced myself into a condition that is not the probability, I framed the arguments against it and I'll show you real quick again here is NASDAQ lower high.

#### NASDAQ Trade Idea

*   You can trade this one to catch up with with what the es has done.
*   **Long Entry**: Let's just say hypothetically you would have been right there at that candle's open, that would be your long entry.
*   **Order Block**: The idea is that that's an order block you can trade inside of the range of that candle.
*   You don't need it to go away and come back if you're expecting it to expand inside that candle on the candle that's painting like when this was forming you can be a long entry there by doing that or not not by doing, but by understanding that.
*   **Past Examples**: Then you can go back and look at my other examples when I'm trading live and you see me doing executions then I'm noting the candle that it's the order block you're looking at that thinking why did you enter there because you're inside of the order block.
*   **Anticipating Change**: I'm anticipating that change in state of delivery, but the opening price you don't need to come back here because I might not do that, especially since we have es doing what expanding higher reaching for the one second 41 19 and a half yeah high on March 6th.
*   **Hypothetical Entry**: Right away from the opening price on this candle at 184, even that would be your hypothetical entry as it was trademark here yeah 184.
*   **Profit**: And now we're at most likely 200, so 16 ticks almost hasn't quite printed it yet.
*   **Sick Sister Approach**: Not that I'm up NASDAQ Trader obviously I can trade it, but that would be the equivalent of what would be an es run using this sick sister approach.
*   **Definition**: Sick sister approach - where you see price moving in es this one's leading to go back to looking at one two or 13 level I mentioned a moment ago there's five handles there but we're gonna go back to NASDAQ because that was the one I just gave you alive this one here hasn't taken out that high yet let me show you okay.
*   **Candle Analysis**: While we were in this candle this black handle here that down closed candle is an order block at the opening price when we're trading down here go back and watch the recording you'll see it's like this you dehydrated going along there I said okay you can go along here and use this one because this is the market that's going to try to catch up with es meaning what BS has done this already it's already made the higher high this High here that high is this High here on NASDAQ that's this high and right here it hadn't taken that high out yet.
*   **Sympathy Play**: This is called the Sick Sister approach where everything is pushing higher this pair or this Market rather it can be done in 4X by the way and you could use it like say for instance this is British pound and say the es is you're a dollar same thing applied to Forex one's already moved so by sympathy this Market will want to catch up with and erase the smt Divergence that was being there so life entering here but the expectation it would catch up and move in sympathy with what the yes has done.
*   **Devil's Advocate**: Think about what we just did I gave you Devil's advocates in a situation where I already knew it was low probability I framed the fair value Gap I told you where the hypothetical stop loss would be and then it traded outside of and it closed with its body on ES and I said okay the next candle it traded higher than the next candle that were just formed.

#### ES Example

*   **Warning Sign**: Go back to the es that way you know what I'm talking about, this candle was the first warning sign that that start would have been in Jeopardy as soon as this candle opened and traded Above This High, that's it you're done you kill the trade it's over that loss that was now small has to be mitigated.
*   We're watching price deliver here it wants to gravitate through the 4119 level as I indicated by having all the confluences and that volume and balance up here.
*   If that's true in the NASDAQ at the time when we were looking at it on this candle right there right here inside of the range of that down close candle you can be a buyer and I gave you the opening price as the hypothetical entry that was your fill okay if you want to use the high of that candle to be even more fair your field would be 84.50 okay 84.50 and we traded to a high of 98, so almost 15 ticks.
*   **Risk Management**: The loss that would have been reduced by protecting the full stop out in es would have been completely eradicated with this move here in NASDAQ using the sixth sister approach where you're using the market that has yet to catch up with the one that's leading.
*   Many times I've used this in 4X, and you can see now how it's used real time over here with the es and NASDAQ.
*   **Imbalance Support**: Now because we had a high here this imbalance right here this would need to be supported so price wouldn't need to have no willingness to close a body below that you can Wick through it and get into this little imbalance, but I want to see the body close inside this or above it otherwise it's probably done for the morning and we'll go into lunch hour.

#### Reflecting on the Process

*   **Enjoyment**: Never thought you could learn so much without having to make money right.
*   **Focus on Learning**: You got to remove all the concern about losing money and making money, learn to read price action.
*   There's so much that you don't know that's required to be profitable consistently.
*   We'll come back to this and let this one cook a little bit, but I don't want to see a closing price and then change my setting on my monitor here so I can watch it in case it does you can mention it to you live and not have to have that on the screen.
*   Let's go back to ES.


Here's the refined and well-structured version of the provided text, designed for optimal readability and comprehension:

### Order Blocks, Mean Thresholds, and PD Arrays: In-Depth Market Analysis

#### Identifying Key Levels and Price Action

*   When analyzing an **order block**, the **mean threshold** (half of the range) is a critical point.
*   This analysis involves eyeballing the level, a common practice.
*   Alongside the mean threshold, consider a **volume imbalance** and a **fair value gap**. These constitute the three **PD Arrays**.
*   Crucially, avoid closing with a body below the **mean threshold**.
*   If price maintains above this threshold, look for **4119-4119.50**.
*   This isn't necessarily a trade entry point, especially being far into the premium.
*   Consider this a point of awareness for managing existing long positions.

#### Session Changes and Trade Management

*   Pay attention to session changes.
*   Don't use the identified level (4119-4119.50) as an entry signal.
*   If already long, monitor price action for signals that support continued upward movement.
*   The three discounted arrays reside within the premium range, near the target.
*   **Target Location:** The target lies higher, with the volume imbalance at the inception of the move.
*   Avoid adding to the position or pyramiding in this premium zone.
*   Focus on managing the existing trade.

#### The Significance of Support and Potential Reversals

*   Price action is observed at 1, 2, and the fair value gap. Note the fair value gap has already been traded into.
*   The price must be supported at the volume imbalance, within the mean threshold of the order block.
*   Problematic Scenario: If price trades and closes with a body *below* the mean threshold, it signals trouble.
*   In this instance, reduce the position size, or reduce the leverage, even with current profits.
*   This is a scenario where taking something off the table as it moves against you, *while still in profit*, is appropriate.
*   Similar to aborting a trade before a stop-loss hit: limiting potential losses when the setup no longer makes sense.
*   When hypothetically long, reduce leverage/exposure if price closes below the mean threshold of the order block, as it indicates a potential consolidation or retracement.

#### Understanding Market Dynamics: Friday's Lunch Hour

*   Be cautious, especially on a Friday, as we transition from the morning session into lunch hour.
*   Lunch Hour Liquidity: Stops tend to be run during/after lunch hour.
*   The market will likely run against sell-side liquidity (stops) built up during the morning's upward move.
*   After hitting that sell side liquidity, it may continue lower or use the run to continue higher.

#### Key Takeaways: Rules and Analysis

*   The Importance of Premium Relative to the Target: Avoid buying high up in a premium range relative to your target.
*    Using Discount Arrays: Employ discount arrays to gauge price's willingness to move higher.
*   **3 PD Arrays for Guidance**: The most immediate PD arrays (volume imbalance, fair value gap, and mean threshold) serve as the last line of defense.
*   Short term support: The volume imbalance is currently offering short-term support.

#### Personal Reflections and Trading Frustrations

*   Valuable Skill: Desiring to abort trades to avoid full stop loss at 20 years old.
*   Books lacked this, focusing only on trade entry.
*   The most important thing to understand is: the understanding of what makes a trade less probable.
*   Frustration with Incomplete Information: Traditional trading books focused on entries but neglected risk mitigation.
*   **Key Missing Factors**: Identifying factors that signal a shift from high probability to low probability.
*   Mitigation: The goal is to mitigate unnecessary full-risk stop-outs or abort losing trades.
*   Personal Rule Development: Creating custom rules based on personal experience of losses.
*    Personal Analysis: Examine causes of downward spirals and account blow-ups, identifying both fears and overconfidence.

#### Core Mentorship and Reading Price

*   The Language: The mentorship lessons use core content to teach the language of price movement.
*   No Signal Service: It is not a signal service.
*   The goal is to teach students how to read price for themselves.
*   The intention is to navigate the emotional and psychological aspects of trading.
*   Focus on Price Reactions: React to price *indications,* not merely to individual trades.
*   It is crucial to not react to individual trades.
*   The key is to not stick with a trade when price action signatures indicate it's no longer viable.

#### Actionable Advice:

*   Three PD array breaks: If three supportive PD arrays fail, it indicates a potential reversal (abort or reduce position).
*   Lack of experience is the reason why this rule is given to students in the early stages
*   Remember, this is a rule-based idea best for early stages.
*   The fact that this has to be acquired on your own is why it's so important
*   Price action learning is experiential, not theoretical.

#### Mentorship Approach

*   The intent is to convey the experience needed to trade and anticipate market difficulties
*   Acquire skills: The goal is to anticipate those conditions
*   It is acquired by tape reading rather than just taking trades.
*   Focus: You should be studying price
*   What Not To Do: Trading solely for money or certifications.
*   The goal of trading should not be certificates.
*   The goal should be to learn how to trade, be precise, and be highly selective of setups.
*   The need to rush it is because someone wants to be able to say, look at this.

#### Precision vs. Rushing

*   Emphasis on Precision: Strive for precision, calculation, and anticipation.
*   If these things can't be anticipated, then be not interested.
*   Embrace Boredom: Being bored by the market is a good sign, indicating a lack of emotional interference.
*   If someone reacts to it, they're going to be at the mercy of their emotions and whatever the result has been on your last trade, which will be the deciding factor of how you're going to think and feel when your next trade.
*   After unprofitable trades, you'll be second-guessing yourself.
*   Responsibility: Owning both decisions and outcomes is crucial.
*   Fast Markets: The current market conditions are not ideal (slow, gradual movement).
*   Ideal Trading Conditions: Preferring quick, sudden movements.
*   Mentoring Consideration: Mentoring requires active chart observation and presence.
*   Seeing this is necessary for a proper mentor.

#### Additional points to consider

*   There will be little distractions and perfect little excuses to say it wasn't my fault, it was something outside of me, and you have to own all that stuff.

#### Journaling:

*   There are key points to note for your trading Journal.
*   **Journal worthy note**: When you have three PD arrays break that were supposed to be supportive for your trade, if they break, that's the clearest indication that you're probably in a reversal.

#### Closing points to consider

*   When regulated brokers are signed up with there are documents stating that you know liquidity may not be there and you may lose more than you have.
*   Inherent risks of trading: stop loss might not even do its job.
*   Black Swan events: In current climate where the general public may not foresee an event.
*   The ability to not be surprised is key.
*   **Take Away**: Look for the protocols and follow them systematically; don't be attached to the outcome of the trade.
*   The experience to trade is acquired by tape reading, not taking trades, and studying price.

*   **Visual Aids for Journaling:** The image below illustrates how your Journal should look like
*   **Three PD Arrays Example**: Volume imbalance, Fair value gap, and the mean threshold of the order block

#### Applying Discount Arrays for Trade Management

*   **Order Flow Indication:** Every time the market trades above a short-term high, it indicates bullish order flow.
*   **Accumulating Long Positions:** If price drops back into any of the discount arrays, you can accumulate a long position, provided you are not in the premium range of your target.
*   **Trade Management:** If you are already in a trade, manage your position using this logic.
*   **Avoid Trading in Premium Areas:** Trying to trade in premium areas during lunch can be risky due to retracements and liquidity runs.

*   **Extending into the Future:** Extend that rectangle into the future if price moves above the volume imbalance formed on February 17th and February 21st.
*   **Trading Above 4119.50:** It's interesting to see how the market trades at or above 4119.50.
*   **Long One-Sided Run:** The market has experienced a long, one-sided run each day since Tuesday.

#### Recap

*   **Trading vs. Learning:** There is a different perspective between just watching and being very highly critical, versus actively trying to learn.
*   **Key Takeaway:** It seems boring when you're going through it, but when you look after the fact and see what's on the chart that you were looking at and annotating live, it gives you a different perspective.


### Analyzing Price Action and Developing a Trading Model

This discussion focuses on understanding price action, developing a personal trading model, and avoiding common pitfalls. The emphasis is on learning from real-time observations and internalizing market dynamics.

#### Responding to Market Analysis and Avoiding Criticism

*   **Reasoning and Reflection:** Instead of questioning decisions after the fact, reflect on the reasons and logic presented during live market analysis. Focus on understanding *why* certain actions were taken.
*   **Irrelevant Questions:** Questions about aspects not discussed are irrelevant to the analysis. If a topic isn't mentioned, it's likely not relevant to the current market perspective.
*   **Real-Time Analysis:** The analysis is conducted in real-time, emphasizing that it's not a cherry-picked, edited perspective. The focus is on observing price behavior and anticipating its delivery.
*   **Pattern Recognition:** The goal is to develop the ability to see patterns, setups, and models that align with established trading principles. Identify the most clearly defined PD Arrays.

#### Identifying Personal Trade Setups

*   **Fractal Analysis:** Focus on the specific portion of price action (the "fractal") being presented. Identify the trade setup that is easy to spot and makes sense individually.
*   **Individual Interpretation:** Not every trader will agree with every aspect of the analysis. Use it as a step-by-step guide, but recognize that personal interpretation is crucial.
*   **Live Market Observation:** The analysis is based on live market data, not pre-recorded information.
*   **Mitigating Loss:** A past example discussed includes how to mitigate a loss using NASDAQ's "six sister approach" when an entry fails.
*   **Inversion Fair Value Gap:** The inversion fair value gap can provide support after an initial move away from it.
*   **Target Level:** The goal was a move towards the 4119-4119.50 level, driven by the daily volume imbalance.

#### Individualizing Mentorship and Trade Selection

*   **Meaningful PD Arrays:** Identify the PD arrays that are most meaningful on an individual basis. This is where mentorship becomes personalized, allowing traders to decide on their actions.
*   **Stair-Step Approach:** Use the analysis as a stair-step, recognizing that not all elements will resonate with every trader.
*   **Personal Observations:** Identify elements seen repeatedly in your own observations.
*   **Submitting to Tape Reading:** Submit to tape reading without pushing buttons, gaining the upside advantages of not having any risk while learning.
*   **Learning to Read Price:** Learn to read what price is doing, and aim to reach a point where it becomes predictable and even "boring."
*   **Rule-Based Trading:** Stick to established rules, even if the outcome of individual trades is uncertain. This is a process of conditioning oneself.
*   **Logical Levels:** Over time, the ability to see how price delivers from PD arrays and gravitates towards logical levels of liquidity or inefficiency will develop.

#### Recalling the Excitement of Early Learning

*   **Early Stages of Learning:** Remember the initial excitement of recognizing PD arrays. Each one is learned at a different stage and time.
*   **Euphoric Feeling:** The feeling of seeing a setup and anticipating its delivery can be euphoric.
*   **Meaningful Trade Example:** A move from a volume imbalance to a high in the bond market can be a significant trade, yielding substantial profit.

*   **Eliminating Distractions:** Stop focusing on distractions and concentrate on what price is doing.
*   **Focus on Price:** Focus on price action by examining each individual bar (open, high, low, close).
*   **Reoccurring Setups:** Look for reoccurring setups that become recognizable every day.

#### Real-Time Analysis and Market Expectations

*   **Data-Driven Approach:** Use a data tracker to monitor key levels, such as 4119.50.
*   **Screenshotting Opportunity:** The current market situation presents a screenshot-worthy opportunity.
*   **Value of Real-Time Insights:** Despite some feeling that the session was a waste of time, the real-time insights and analysis are valuable.

*   **Consistent Logic:** When the market reacts as anticipated, it confirms the validity of the logic being presented.
*   **Algorithmic Market Behavior:** The market's algorithmic behavior leads to predictable reactions at key levels.

#### Acknowledging the Source and Applying Knowledge

*   **Volume Imbalances:** Volume imbalances may not be readily found in traditional books until recently, when they may have been introduced by others copying established concepts.
*   **Echoing vs. Teaching:** It's easy to repeat what others have said, but true teaching involves a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms.
*   **Identifying Daily Volume Imbalance:** Look for 50% of the daily volume imbalance (consequent encroachment) after identifying a range from high to low.
*   **Potential Objectives:** Note the potential objectives such as 4125 and 4130.5.

#### Summarizing Key Principles

*   **Development of New Traders:** What was covered is crucial for the development of new traders and students of price action.

*   **Drumbeat of Accuracy:** The consistent accuracy of the analysis demonstrates its validity.
*   **Stop Protection:** The protection of stops is a key element of risk management.


### Mitigating Losses with the "Sick Sister Approach" on NASDAQ

This section details how a small loss can be mitigated by leveraging NASDAQ's "Sick Sister Approach." This involves shifting focus to NASDAQ when the primary market (ES) presents a losing trade scenario.

*   **Rationale:** The speaker acknowledges that those who remain engaged and learn from the live sessions are more likely to succeed than those who give up easily.
*   **Hypothetical Loss Example:** The losing trade idea was hypothetically discussed around the 10:50 time window.
*   **Execution on NASDAQ:**
    *   The strategy involves identifying a down-close candle within a specific range.
    *   Before the range expanded, the opening price of the candle was identified as the potential entry point.
    *   A worst-case scenario stop-loss was set at the high of the candle, around 184.5.
    *   The goal was to capture a run above this high, mitigating the initial loss and potentially achieving a small profit.
*   **Realigning with the Primary Market (ES):**
    *   After mitigating the loss on NASDAQ, the focus shifts back to ES.
    *   This allows the trader to realign with the market, armed with the knowledge that it's likely to move upwards towards a specific area.
    *   The approach contrasts with being unsure in a market moving in both directions.
*   **Predefined Rule-Based Ideas and Market Reactions:**
    *   The speaker emphasizes the importance of predefined, rule-based ideas.
    *   When the market trades down into a level that should act as support, it's crucial to observe if it indeed provides support.
    *   The market should ideally not go beyond that level.
*   **Specific Price Action Analysis:**
    *   The closing price of a particular candle (4110.75) is noted.
    *   The low of a subsequent candle (4111) is observed to be one tick above the closing price.
    *   This confirms that the volume imbalance was not violated and the market reacted positively.

### Identifying and Utilizing PD Arrays

This segment explains the use of Price Delivery Arrays (PD Arrays) for identifying trading opportunities.

*   **Key PD Arrays:** The speaker identifies a fair value gap, a volume imbalance, and the mean threshold of an order block as the three primary PD Arrays.
*   **Conditions for Bullish Order Flow:**
    *   Price needs to be supported by these PD Arrays.
    *   A closing body below these levels would indicate a breach of the PD Arrays, signaling a shift in order flow away from bullish sentiment for the near term.
*   **Observed Market Behavior:** The market rallied above a short-term high, came back down into the fair value gap, presenting a buying opportunity. However, proximity to the target necessitates careful trade management.

### Applying PD Array Matrix in Trading Decisions

This section explains how the PD Array matrix is used to inform decisions about adding to positions.

*   **Avoiding Pyramiding:** When the market is in a premium and the order flow is bullish, adding more to a position (pyramiding) is discouraged. This is because the market is high in the PD Array matrix and could retrace back to equilibrium.
*   **Equilibrium and Range:** The speaker does not add additional entry points once the price gets past the equilibrium of the anticipated range.
*   **Target Level Example:** The initial target was 4119.5, representing a prior high from March 6th, 2023.
*   **Inversion Fair Value Gap:** If the market negates the initial shorting opportunity at this level, it becomes an inversion fair value gap. This means that after the price moves away, a return to this level presents a potential support area for further upward movement.
*   **Implied Dealing Range:**
    *   The range from a low to the target (4119.5) is considered an implied dealing range.
    *   The analysis implies that if the move occurs, there should be some measure of re-accumulation within that range.
    *   The speaker highlights the 75%, 50%, and 25% levels within this range.

### Understanding Consolidation and Equilibrium

This part dives into the concept of consolidation in relation to equilibrium within the implied dealing range.

*   **Consolidation at Equilibrium:** The majority of consolidation occurs around the 50% level, which represents equilibrium.
*   **Accumulation of New Longs:** This consolidation phase involves the accumulation of new long positions, which traders need to manage as part of their open position.
*   **Entry Points:** Entry points could have been based on the volume imbalance observed earlier.
*   **Pseudo Experience:** The speaker encourages traders to record these moments and add "pseudo experience" to their trading journals.
*   **Time Distortion:** Consolidation at the 50% level leads to extended periods of time distortion, where the market moves sideways.
*   **Filtering Out Noise:** During these periods, traders should disregard some PD Array signals that would otherwise be valid during trending periods. Focus on the defining range high and low.

### Identifying Support and Accumulation Signals

This portion focuses on identifying signals that indicate support and accumulation during consolidation.

*   **Fair Value Gap Analysis:**
    *   The speaker emphasizes watching the bodies of candles.
    *   If the bodies are supporting the price and not closing below the low end of the fair value gap, it suggests accumulation.
*   **Smart Money Accumulation:** This behavior indicates that smart money is accumulating long positions.
*   **Displacement and Order Flow Confirmation:** The breakout above a short-term high qualifies and confirms that the order flow is bullish.
*   **Avoiding Indicators:** The speaker reiterates that a DOM, book maps, heat maps, or other indicators are not necessary for this analysis.

### Volume Imbalances as Entry and Target Points

This segment elaborates on the strategic use of volume imbalances.

*   **Volume Imbalance Confirmation:** A volume imbalance was noted, and when price gapped with an opening price, it was identified as another volume imbalance to watch for support.
*   **Algorithmic Price Delivery:** The speaker contrasts this approach with traditional support and resistance, emphasizing algorithmic price delivery.
*   **Volume Imbalances as Tools:** These small gaps and volume imbalances can serve as either entry points or targets for partial or terminal exits.
*   **Model Integration:** This concept is a component of a trader's unique model or trading plan, which they trust and follow, regardless of others' opinions.

### Order Block Analysis and Liquidity Considerations

This section details how order blocks are analyzed in the context of liquidity.

*   **Order Block Location:** The order block is located in the upper quarter of the range.
*   **Anticipating Market Behavior:** In this area, the expectation is for a quick and sudden move.
*   **Avoiding Sell-Side Liquidity Runs:** It's unlikely that the market will drop down to take sell stops in this upper portion because it's in a hurry to reach liquidity.
*   **Stop Loss Placement:** The algorithm is designed to prevent deep retracements in the upper 25% range, discouraging traders from placing stop losses above the March 6 high.

### Validation and Precision of the Methodology

This part stresses the validation of the speaker's trading methodology and its precision.

*   **Order Block Reaction:** The market runs into the order block but doesn't move outside its body.
*   **Direct Move to Target:** After accumulating more positions, the market moves directly up to the March 6 high.
*   **Unconventional Knowledge:** The speaker states that this level of precision and logic is not found in books.
*   **Future Publications:** Future books will contain amplifications of these concepts.
*   **Live Proof of Concept:** The speaker emphasizes that the live analysis demonstrates the validity of the concepts.
*   **Technical Science:** The speaker asserts that their approach is a scientific and technical science.
*   **Superiority of Approach:** The speaker claims that their approach is unmatched in the industry.

### Further Developments and Market Predictions

*   **Future Content:** More precise and advanced content will be shared later in the year.
*   **Enthusiasm for Sharing:** The speaker expresses excitement about sharing these concepts and seeing the audience's reactions.
*   **Rejection and Rally Example:** The market rejected a volume imbalance low and immediately rallied.
*   **South-Side Liquidity:** South-side liquidity rests below, near the old equilibrium of the implied dealing range.
*   **Contrasting with Traditional Advice:** This strategy contrasts with the conventional advice to react to price rather than predict it.

### Capital Preservation and Risk Management

This part stresses the importance of preserving capital and managing risk.

*   **Proactive vs. Reactive Trading:** The speaker points out that his analysis involves anticipating market movements rather than simply reacting to them.
*   **Stop Loss for Preservation:** The exception is when using a stop loss to preserve capital, but this isn't an entry mechanism.
*   **Capital Preservation:** Capital preservation is the most crucial rule in trading.
*   **Personal Responsibility:** The speaker emphasizes that neither the broker, spouse, nor the speaker himself can manage risk for the trader.
*   **Self-Discipline:** Traders must be self-disciplined and avoid being victims of their own weak-mindedness.

### Addressing Doubts and Providing Evidence

This portion addresses doubts about the speaker's methods and provides evidence of their validity.

*   **Removing Excuses:** The speaker states that the live analysis removes all excuses and doubts about the validity of the concepts.
*   **Real-Time Data:** The information is presented in real-time, with minimal latency.
*   **Absence of Argument:** The speaker argues that there is no valid argument against the demonstrated logic.
*   **Focus on Learning:** The emphasis is on learning the underlying principles rather than simply copying trades.
*   **Demo Account Training:** The speaker's paid students are trained using demo accounts, emphasizing price action.
*   **Personal Accountability:** When students fail, it's due to their own errors, not the speaker's lack of information or market calls.
*   **Master-Student Analogy:** The speaker uses an analogy of a student trying to teach the master, highlighting the importance of being receptive to instruction.

### Interviewing Successful Students

This section discusses upcoming interviews with successful students.

*   **Real-Money Success:** The speaker will be posting interviews with individuals who have successfully used the speaker's teachings to make real money.
*   **Guaranteed Skill Set:** The speaker guarantees that students will read price better than through other teachings.
*   **Skill Set vs. Trading:** Trading requires a skill set that you have to be prepared to use.


### Mastering Trading: Anticipation, Skill, and Avoiding the Rush

This section emphasizes the importance of mastering trading through anticipation rather than reaction, developing a strong skill set, and avoiding the pitfalls of rushing into trading with real money before being fully prepared.

*   **Mastery Through Anticipation:** True mastery comes when you can **anticipate** how the market should behave, not just **react** to price movements.
*   **Avoiding Reactive Trading:** Avoid chasing price, buying, and selling impulsively because the market is moving. Don't think it will move 10 more handles when it has already moved 18.

### The Journey to Mastery: Patience and Guidance

This section details the long and challenging journey to achieving mastery in trading, the lack of encouragement, and the importance of proper guidance.

*   **A Long and Difficult Path:** Reaching a point where you can consistently see market patterns takes **time, energy, and prayer**. It's not an overnight process.
*   **Lack of Encouragement:** The speaker emphasizes that he was not encouraged by anyone in the flesh.
*   **Resourcefulness:** The speaker did not have access to the resources available today. He uses his videos to bridge the gap of his past ignorance.
*   **Avoiding Idolization:** The speaker cautions against idolizing him or attempting to mimic him, emphasizing that he is merely a conduit for information.
*   **Focus on Self-Improvement:** Use the provided information to improve yourself, but how you build upon it is up to you.
*   **Desire for Your Success:** The speaker expresses a strong desire to see his audience succeed.
*   **The Pitfalls of Rushing:** Rushing the process only makes it longer and denies the speaker the satisfaction of seeing your success.
    *   Rushing to a funded account before being ready.
    *   Trading with real money prematurely.
    *   Trading with insufficient funds.

### The Importance of Proper Funding and Skill Development

This section highlights the necessity of proper funding and the importance of skill development over immediate financial gains.

*   **Adequate Capital is Crucial:** You need to have a little bit of "skin in the race." Trading with a $100 or $500 account is not sufficient.
*   **Focus on Skill Development First:** Before focusing on money, learn and prove your analytical skills.
*   **Hypothetical Scenario: Leveraging Skills:** Consider a scenario where you can't trade yourself but have a friend who will execute your instructions.
    *   You provide analysis and instructions, and your friend trades accordingly.
    *   At the end of the month, you receive compensation for your expertise.
    *   This arrangement allows you to acquire what you currently lack.
*   **Skill Over Money:** You don't need money right now; you need the skill set.
*   **High Demand for Skilled Traders:** If the speaker offered real-time trading signals, millions of dollars would be offered. Firms already recognize the value of his insights.
*   **Prioritizing Your Success:** The speaker turns down partnerships and business arrangements to focus on your success.
*   **Testimonial Goal:** The speaker's ultimate goal is to receive a heartfelt testimonial email detailing your success and the positive impact he had on your journey.
*   **The Joy of Arriving:** Experiencing success feels incredibly rewarding and provides a sense of purpose.

# Market Analysis - April 2024 (Based on YouTube Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLis0LcbUaQ)

## Introduction

**Good morning, folks!** Hope you're all doing well. How are you today? Did you miss me? I had a wonderful relaxing Passover and happy Resurrection Day for the folks in the same faith as me.

*   If you're following on Twitter, please give me a "five by five" (volume is good, charts are visible) on a tweet directly to me.

**Alright, so let's get into this.**

## Weekly Chart Analysis (Continuous Contract - Trading View)

*   **Purpose:** Using TradingView's continuous contract due to the absence of annotations, allowing for broad-stroke analysis.
*   **Current Week:** Observing the present week's price action.
*   **Previous Week's Low:**
    *   Watched yesterday, but didn't see it trade below.
    *   Wanted to see a sweep below and inside the imbalance.
    *   Then, look towards **4180.**
*   **Overall Stance:** Maintaining a bullish stance on ES.
*   **Target:** Thinking we might want to poke above this high.
    *   Visible **volume imbalance** in that area.

**In layman's terms:**

*   Looking at the swing high on the weekly chart.
*   We broke it, attempted to get down to the gap yesterday (between this candle's high and this candle's low).
*   Thinking: if we traded down into that gap and then showed willingness to go higher today, attention would shift to that high or, at the very minimum, last week's high.
*   **No current indication of a top.**
*   **Market Condition:** Fickle right now, making analysis more challenging.
*   Coming off a holiday week away from the market.
*   Yesterday: Trying to work off "chart rust" and get in sync with price action. Usually takes a couple days.
*   **Approach:** Not being dogmatic about opinions today; warming up to what the market is most likely to do.

## Current Contract Analysis (E-Mini S&P June Contract - Symbol: ESM2024)

*   **Delivery Contract Month:** M is June.
*   **Area of Interest:** Area that was drawn attention to on the continuous contract.
*   **Other Points of Interest:** Old high and current position relative to yesterday.
*   **Monday's High:** Would like to see it bump that.
*   **How we trade above it:** Influential for tomorrow's FMC price action.
*   **Expectation:** Most likely a small range day.
    *   Large range, then small range on Monday.
    *   Tuesday: Nothing really warrants a large range.
*   **Teaching Philosophy:**
    *   Not looking for a lot of excitement today.
    *   "Bread and butter" type setups (easy in, get five handles, be done).
    *   Once the target is reached, stop trading and do something else. Don't marry the idea of being in front of charts all day.
*   **Reasoning:** More impactful news events later in the week on Wednesday and Thursday. (Check your economic calendar.)

## 60-Minute Chart Analysis

*   **High Annotation:** Scrubbing to show where levels are being drawn from.
*   **Four-Hour Imbalance:** All of this in here was a four-hour imbalance.
    *   Used the order block (red level).
    *   Trade up into this.
*   **City:** Imbalance between this candle's low and this candle's high.
*   **Difficulty:** Inside this range and a larger range on the daily chart. Trading range for the last several days. Makes settling on one side of the market difficult.
*   **Live Stream Delay:** Originally planned to open the live stream at quarter after nine, but delayed due to market uncertainty.

## Pre-Market Observations (Pre 9:30 AM EST)

*   Everything mixed; Nasdaq took a hammering so far this morning, S&P relatively strong, Dow is the leader on the upside.
*   Mixed bag.
*   Expecting weakness in the dollar (risk-on for Forex).
    *   Like the idea of British pound trying to reach up into **1.2445** (maybe **1.2444** ish).
    *   Euro dollar: Think it wants to visit **1.0930.**
    *   Dollar: Think it wants to take out its 6 AM lows.
*   **Action:** Need to take all this information and build an idea around it.
*   **Timing:** A little too early in my opinion, but want to focus on the **10 o'clock to 11 o'clock setup.**

## Trading Strategy: Dealing with Doubt

*   **If in doubt:** Like say going into the marketplace early on and watching the market since about 5:30 this morning.
*   Not really having a feeling for what it wants to do.
*   **Chart Observation:** One could say, "Look at these lows here, why wouldn't they want to take those out?" They *can*.
    *   **Current Prediction:** Not seeing that happening right now.
    *   More likely tomorrow (if it's going to go down there at all).
    *   **Currently:** Not subscribing to the idea that we're going lower at the moment.
*   **Leaning:** Expectation that what's been put in motion on the weekly chart is likely to continue.
    *   The levels I was looking for are still a little bit higher than where we are now.
*   **Additional Analysis:**
    *   Movement followed by consolidation.
    *   Usually (not always): consolidation after a price run will at least take out the old high.
*   **Even if wrong:** This High still could be taken out, creating a scenario for a breaker to form.
    *   Either way (continues higher or runs this high to create a reversal pattern): it matters not, because there's more likelihood.
*   **Approach after Break:**
    *   After being away from the market for 10 days, trying to go into it slowly.
    *   Not trying to springboard right back in.
    *   A little rusty; don't know the rhythm of the market right now.
*   **Goal:** Looking for things that build confidence.
    *   Seeing a lot of things both sides right now, can argue both sides of the market.

## Defining High Probability Trades

*   **High Probability Definition (for students):** Where there's no way to use what I teach to frame the other side of the trade.
*   If you can't do that, then that's high probability.
*   If there's a 50/50 likelihood that you can explain the market to likely go higher or lower when you're trying to push the button, this will probably save a lot of you a lot of money and a lot of heartache.
*   Go into every trade with the expectation of, "Can I see those on the trade panning out?" If you can, you probably are not in a high probability trade.
*   **Premise:** To identify those conditions and ferret out/filter the opportunities that are not so ideal.
*   **Common Misconception:** New traders think there should always be a trade available because the markets are trading 24 hours. That's not good advice.
*   There's always something to get yourself into, but that doesn't mean it's favorable.
*   Trying to do my best by presenting the things I lean on in terms of experience, the things I look for to help prevent me from going into the marketplace when I shouldn't.
*   Hopefully students can glean that insight by seeing multiple examples and then find their own model.

## Four-Hour Chart Deep Dive

*   **Yesterday's Low:** Did not take out the low yesterday.
*   **Desired Action:** Really wanted to see it happen.
    *   Wanted to see it go down, clean that up, and then work towards going higher.
    *   Would have felt very confident this morning, probably would have been up in London trading it long.
*   **Outcome:** Didn't do it yesterday.
*   **Yesterday Afternoon:** Outlined a couple of things that presented a bullish run.
    *   Really was just trying to find my footing in what price action has been doing since my break.
*   **Observations:**
    *   Like the down closed candle here.
    *   The low: 4132 and three quarters
    *   The high: 4134
    *   Didn't quite get to that. Another the high.
*   **Analysis:** Watching that.
    *   This imbalance in here.
*   **Timing:** Waiting between the 10 o'clock and 11 o'clock hour.
*   **Imbalance (High/Low):** Don't need to annotate because I already have something that's more refined in the lower time frame.
*   **Trading Action:** Notice how we trade up into the order block here (large up close candle, the shift lower).
*   **City:** This down closed candle (we had buy side here, so we ran up, hit that, and went lower).
*   **Monitoring:** Dollar Index consolidating, hasn't really moved much.
*   **Market Comparison:** NASDAQ went lower.
    *   Will cycle through ES vs. NASDAQ vs. Dow when we get into the five minute chart.

## Hourly Chart Examination

*   Start to see some of the new week opening gaps (heavier thick black lines).
*   Small little gap in here while I've been talking to you, rallying up into that.
*   Apart from trading back to an old new week opening gap, there's really no imbalances in all of this run here below what's being shown here.
*   15-minute/5-minute chart imbalance.

## 15-Minute Chart Scrutiny

*   **Shaded Area:** Gray area is the current new week opening gap.
*   **Shortened Trading Hour Schedule (Last Friday):** Holiday schedule caused them to shorten trading hours, which messes up the new week opening gap.
*   **New Week Opening Gap:** 4140.50 and 4137 even.
    *   Reason: In close proximity to what the actual new week opening gap is for this week.
    *   Where we closed last Friday in shortened holiday hours to where we opened on Sunday is the little gray box area.
    *   Just to show I'm observing it that way.
*   **Personal Practice:** I do not use it if we have a holiday schedule that impacts Friday.
*   Look for the closest new week opening gap in the last 60 days in that range. If I don't have it, then I don't use it.
    *   **Reason:** I don't trust the data because it's not based on actual market normal times.
*   Even if there was no holiday that impacted Friday's trading and we shortened the hours, I would still have that 4140 and a half and 4137 on my chart anyway.
*   Removes that uncertainty that I have adopted over the years.
*   Filter it out kind of like how I'll use the Asian range from a Friday the week prior (I'll use that Asian range on Monday's trading).
*   Makes no sense to anyone else that understands there's an agent range or whatever.
*   **Sunday Trading:**
    *   I don't trust the Sunday session.
    *   For Forex: I don't look at the Asian range on Sundays for Monday's trading.
    *   I use Fridays.
    *   The Market's going to refer back to an actual full trading day versus where we just opened up.
    *   I have other tools that I would utilize for Sunday. I don't trade them anymore, but when I was trading Sundays I would just use what you've been learning here.
*   **For indices:** Indices open with the opening session on New York at 9:30. So that's an impactful time.
*   In the 15-minute time frame, that's that imbalance right here, but we'll see in the five-minute chart it's refined.
*   Dropping into five minute.


Okay, here is the meticulously organized and refined version of the provided text, ensuring that every detail, context, and nuance is retained while enhancing readability and structure.

## Five-Minute Chart Analysis & Market Insights

### Refined Imbalances & Chart Observations

*   **Refined Chart Details:**
    *   The chart is now clean and precise, showcasing the meticulous refinement process.
    *   Specific candle levels (low and high) are highlighted for clarity.
    *   A small imbalance is identified, resulting from the refinement of the four-hour, 60-minute, and 15-minute charts.

*   **Refinement Rationale:**
    *   The focus is on pinpointing the core area that price is most likely to target for rebalancing.
    *   The process avoids the complexities of tracking the highest highs and lowest lows across larger ranges.

### Trading Activity & New Week Opening Gaps

*   **Recent Price Action:**
    *   A small "city" (likely a trading range) was observed.
    *   Price returned to the area and traded there at the 9:30 AM open.
    *   A break lower occurred, testing an old new week opening gap at **4140.5.**
    *   This level acted as resistance.
*   **New Week Opening Gap Discrepancies:**
    *   The market traded outside the anticipated new week opening gap.
    *   This is attributed to the impact of holidays on Friday or Sunday trading sessions.
    *   In such cases, adjustments are made by using the Tuesday opening or the midnight opening for Forex.
*   **Rule-Based Approach:**
    *   The speaker emphasizes the importance of having protocols to filter the use of specific trading tools.
    *   While numerous tools and techniques are employed, the underlying rules ensure the process remains manageable.
*   **Contextual Learning:**
    *   The speaker prefers to teach these rules in context, demonstrating their application in real-time market scenarios.
    *   The frequency of using specific techniques varies (e.g., holiday-related adjustments aren't weekly occurrences).

### Index Comparison & Volume Imbalance Analysis

*   **Index Strength Comparison:**
    *   **NASDAQ:** Identified as the weakest among the indices.
    *   **Dow:** Considered the strongest, noting its composition of 30 stocks versus NASDAQ's 100.
    *   **E-Mini S&P (ES):** Positioned between NASDAQ and Dow in terms of relative strength.
*   **Volume Imbalance Dynamics:**
    *   A rally occurred towards the old new week opening gap, which acted as resistance.
    *   The body of the candle stopped below the volume imbalance.
    *   Price crossed over this volume imbalance multiple times without the body of a candle settling across it.
    *   **Key Principle:** As long as no candle body settles across it, the volume imbalance acts as a "magnet," attracting price.
*   **Volume Imbalance Confirmation:**
    *   Satisfaction with a volume imbalance occurs when a candle body completely covers its high and low.
    *   After this confirmation, the volume imbalance is typically removed from the chart.
    *   Until confirmation, price may repeatedly test the imbalance.
    *   This flexibility can be challenging for new traders.
*   **Unique Insight:**
    *   This particular nuanced approach to volume imbalances, including the "body layover" confirmation, is new and previously unshared even with charter members.

### Short-Term Market Outlook

*   **Potential Scenario:**
    *   The sell-side (downward movement) appears attractive.
    *   However, this isn't expected to be a day of significant market crash.
*   **Key Condition:**
    *   For the sell-side scenario to materialize, price must remain below the new week opening gap high at **4140.5**.
*   **Target Level:**
    *   If the condition is met, price is expected to gravitate towards the **4132.5 - 4132.75** level.
*   **Timeframe Exploration:**
    *   Analysis will cycle through three-minute and one-minute charts.

### Fair Value Gap & Liquidity Considerations

*   **Potential Fair Value Gap:**
    *   A potential fair value gap exists, with price having already traded through the swing low.
    *   The question is whether price will return to this gap and then react to run the low at **4132.75**.
*   **Five-Minute Fair Value Gap:**
    *   The teal-colored rectangle marks a five-minute fair value gap.
    *   Price has entered this gap several times, suggesting liquidity resting below.
    *   The market may try to push below this level to capture that liquidity.
*   **Limited Range:**
    *   The anticipated movement is less than five handles, which is not considered a significant range.

### Addressing Misconceptions & Timeframe Dependency

*   **One-Minute Chart Interpretation:**
    *   Addressing a potential misconception: even if the one-minute chart appears to show a candle body laying over the volume imbalance, it doesn't count.
*   **Timeframe Priority:**
    *   The higher timeframe in which the volume imbalance was initially observed dictates the confirmation criteria.
    *   Lower timeframes are subordinate to the parent timeframe.
    *   Analogy: The higher timeframe is like a parent, and lower timeframes are like unruly children.

### Current Market Conditions & Dollar Index Analysis

*   **Trading Setup:**
    *   Price traded back up to the low of the old new week opening gap, inside a fair value gap and order block.
    *   This should facilitate movement to the sell side.
*   **Dollar Index Observation:**
    *   On the five-minute chart, the Dollar Index is trading inside a fair value gap on the 10 o'clock candle.
    *   This is identified as a SIBI (Sell-Side Imbalance Buy-Side Inefficiency).
*   **Preference:**
    *   Ideally, the speaker would prefer to see the Dollar Index move lower while ES moves higher.
    *   The current SIBI is slightly concerning.
    *   The speaker would like to see the sell-side of the SIBI swept and rejected before moving higher.
*   **Trade Viability:**
    *   Reiterating that a short trade isn't viable due to the lack of sufficient range.

### Trading Strategy: Five-Handle Objective

*   **Range Requirement:** For a trade to be viable, in the speaker's opinion, it has to offer 10 handles.
*   **Five-Handle Objective:** Aiming for five handles, a very low-hanging fruit, an easy objective to strive for as a new student learning.
*   **Rationale:**
    *   Provides a forgiving framework for new traders, allowing for entry and exit imperfections.
    *   Capturing five handles consistently builds confidence and reduces anxiety about missing moves.
*   **Abundant Opportunities:**
    *   Numerous opportunities for five-handle runs occur throughout the trading day, even outside the traditionally taught kill zones.
    *   Trading during the lunch hour is possible with a thorough understanding of the specific rules.
*   **Lunchtime Caution:**
    *   Without proper understanding, traders can be caught in stop-hunting activities during lunch hours, where the market moves against profitable positions from the morning session.

### Risk Management & Trade Framing

*   **Fair Value Gap Revisited:**
    *   Referring back to the fair value gap previously discussed.
    *   The high of the candle is at **4136.25.**
    *   A move to **4131.50** is needed to achieve the five-handle objective (including commission consideration).
*   **Execution:**
    *   Upon trading into the high of the previous candle within the fair value gap, a trader would be inside the "city" (trading range).

### Unrealistic Expectations & Market Realities

*   **Small Stop Losses & Big R Multiples:** The speaker doesn't think that's something that a new Trader should strive for because number one it's impractical
*   **Proficiency & Patience:** to get to that level being consistent it takes a long time and many of you don't have the patience to even do the certain drills and things that I teach that are simple
*   **Discipline & Self Control:** you can't exercise discipline and self control there how could you reasonably expect as a new student or a new Trader to trade with a very small stop loss and have these high molecules because you don't know how to hold on to a winning trade's hard to hold on to even when you're new because you see the profit because that's what you're going to be watching instead of price you'll be watching that number fluctuate up and down and regretting that you enclose a trade when it was up a thousand the account's only up 850 and it drops to 750 and then you're only up to 700 and then you close the trade because you think it's reversed on you and then it runs to 2800 or whatever it is you're gonna not have roles you're not going to have any experience so that's the reason why I teach to start with five handles not that that's going to be the end of your career in terms of the the height that's not the Zenith okay that's not the Apex uh point of your proficiency it just means that I'm giving you what I believe in my opinion and most of my students would agree that that's a good Baseline to start with I don't think 10 handles is for ES because it takes a little bit more filtering out to find that full 10 handles but I think that you should try to look for a price move that offers that 10 Handles in the beginning because it is allowing you a lot of forgiveness in entering a little too early a little too late and getting out maybe at the the most well unlikely location


Okay, here is the meticulously organized and refined version of the provided text, ensuring that every detail, context, and nuance is retained while enhancing readability and structure.

## Trading Strategy, Risk Management, and Market Analysis

### Holding Trades & Managing Drawdown

*   The speaker emphasizes the importance of learning to **hold onto a trade** even when it moves slightly against you, resulting in a drawdown.
*   Drawdown is considered a **normal part of trading** and should not be avoided.
*   Trades will **not always immediately move into profit** upon entry.
*   New traders often experience **uncertainty and doubt**, which they must overcome.
*   It's **crucial to confront these challenges** instead of avoiding them.

### Trade Example & 10-Handle Filter

*   Referencing a previous short trade at **4136.25**, the speaker notes that a move to **4132.75** wouldn't even offer five handles.
*   While the price traded down to the low end of a five-minute fair value gap, it **didn't deliver a significant run** to the sell side.
*   The speaker uses a **10-handle filter** to identify setups likely to move at least 10 handles, aiming to capture five.
*   This filter allows for **forgiveness in entry and exit** and, more importantly, **reduces the likelihood of taking unprofitable trades.**
*   The goal is to have the **opportunity** to achieve 10 handles, not necessarily to capture the full amount.

### Fair Value Gap & Trading Protocols

*   Referring to a fair value gap, the speaker notes that price wicked outside the lines of it, hit the last up close candle, and traded down to the low of the fair value gap on the five-minute chart but didn't trade to the sell side.
*   By using the 10-handle filter, traders would have avoided this trade, as it wouldn't have offered the opportunity to reach the target.
*   The speaker stresses the necessity of having **trading protocols** in place.
*   These protocols are not meant to restrict trading but to provide structure and increase the likelihood of success.

### Discipline, Self-Control, and Trading Psychology

*   Trading is a challenging business because many individuals struggle with **discipline and self-control.**
*   Traders who lack these qualities are more likely to lose money and attribute their losses to external factors (e.g., flawed methods, scams).
*   The speaker's rules are designed to **provide a framework** for traders to grow their understanding of price action.
*   The aim is to operate with **context**, rather than guessing.

### Technical Science & Market Boredom

*   Trading is described as a **technical science** with crucial details.
*   Knowing *what* to do, *when* to do it, and *when not* to do it is essential.
*   Lack of knowledge can lead to impulsive trading driven by boredom.
*   Those eager to learn recognize the value of the speaker's information and use it to enhance their framework.

### Revisited Volume Imbalance & New Week Opening Gap

*   The speaker revisits the **volume imbalance** and notes that price is now at the low of the new week opening gap.
*   The dollar index's fair value gap at 10 o'clock on the five-minute chart hasn't provided a strong directional bias.

### Market Fluctuations & Trading Criteria

*   Price action will always have fluctuations.
*   Forecasting price movement between reference points **doesn't automatically make it a tradable opportunity.**
*   New students often inquire why the speaker didn't take a specific trade.
*   The speaker emphasizes that trades must meet specific **criteria** to be considered viable.

### Index Comparison Revisited

*   The speaker reiterates that the **Dow** has been relatively stronger, while the **NASDAQ** is weaker.

### Volume Imbalance Update & Chart Management

*   The speaker notes that a candle has now laid across the volume imbalance, signifying that it's **no longer relevant**.
*   The speaker removes the volume imbalance from the chart to avoid clutter.
*   The speaker uses specific notations on the charts to communicate with the viewers and highlight key reference points for PD arrays.

### New Week Opening Gap Strategy

*   The speaker prefers not to use new week opening gaps framed during holidays.
*   The strategy is to look for price to stay above the new week opening gap low and create a buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency (BISI) in the form of a fair value gap.

### Potential Market Scenarios

*   The speaker outlines a potential scenario where a fair value gap forms between the current high and low.
*   This setup could lead to a run-up to a high at **4149**, potentially extending to **4180**.
*   This is presented as the speaker's way of interpreting price action and using reference points.

### Transparency & Market Conditions

*   The speaker shares their observation from a previous session where many anticipated reactions didn't materialize.
*   The speaker acknowledges a lack of a "Hardline definitive" opinion on the market's direction due to mixed signals.
*   The **Dow, NASDAQ, and ES are decoupled**, making trading more challenging.
*   Decoupling means that the indexes are not acting in agreement with one another, and are making trading decisions more difficult.

### Supply & Demand vs. Balanced Price Range

*   The speaker emphasizes that their teachings are not based on simple supply and demand.
*   The upward price run is characterized as a return to a buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency.
*   Once price trades through this imbalance and leaves it, it becomes a **balanced price range**, acting as a barrier to price action.
*   The speaker claims this concept is unique to their teachings and algorithmic in nature.

### Market Reaction & Dollar Index

*   The market exhibits a reaction at the balanced price range.
*   The dollar index isn't providing much directional bias.

### Downside Targets & PM Session Considerations

*   If price accelerates downward, a potential target is **4127**, corresponding to a small imbalance.
*   The speaker suggests monitoring for changes during the PM session (post-New York local time).

### High-Probability Setups & Regret Avoidance

*   The speaker asks viewers if they see any high-probability setups in the current price action, even with the benefit of hindsight.
*   The speaker doesn't see any trade in this situation.
*   The goal is to avoid regret by recognizing that **not every price movement warrants a trade.**
*   Impulsive trading can lead to losses and major drawdowns, which are avoidable.

### Overcoming Fear & Doubt

*   The speaker shares their own history of blowing accounts and experiencing fear and doubt.
*   These experiences motivated them to find opportunities with higher probabilities of success.

### Silver Bullet Trade & Liquidity Pools

*   The "silver bullet" trade hasn't formed yet on the current market.
*   Between 10 AM and 11 AM, a fair value gap typically forms, setting up a run into a pool of liquidity.
*   Liquidity is currently extended to a specific level.

### Short-Term Targets & Nasdaq Analysis

*   Sell-side liquidity is identified at a specific price point, contingent on a run above a high.
*   The speaker is watching for a potential press lower into that low and a dig into an imbalance.
*   A quick look at the NASDAQ reveals a potentially more defined setup, with the speaker about to adjust fib settings.

## Market Analysis and Trading Strategy Deep Dive

### Screenshot Reminder & Fulcrum Point Explanation

*   The speaker advises viewers to **take a screenshot** of the current setup either from the video or during the live stream for future reference.
*   The speaker is using the current price action as a **fulcrum point**.
*   The speaker notes that price is within a **fair value gap** (FVG).
*   The discussed fair value gap is valid between **10:00 AM and 11:00 AM**.
*   **NASDAQ** is identified as the weaker index, making it a focal point for analysis.

### NASDAQ Analysis & Swing Projection

*   The speaker describes a potential scenario:
    *   A run-up into the fair value gap.
    *   A failure for price to remain above the fair value gap.
    *   Price sharply moves down, breaking below the fair value gap low.
*   The speaker uses a **swing projection** technique, envisioning the price movement as a swinging door.
    *   The hinge of the door is the high of the range.
    *   The edge of the door (the potential price target) is determined by the negative one standard deviation from the fulcrum point.
*   This projection is based on the range from the low to the high (fulcrum point).
*   If the low is broken, the swing projection targets the negative one standard deviation level.

### ES Analysis & Running Down Equity

*   Moving to **ES (E-mini S&P 500 futures)**, the speaker pulls up a two-minute chart and cleans up the display, removing clutter for better visibility.
*   The speaker highlights a **volume imbalance** in the area.
*   Price reacted after hitting the low of the volume imbalance.
*   The speaker wants to see price triggered down into the specified area, reinforcing the bearish outlook.
*   Annotating the new low serves a specific purpose: tracking short positions and their potential profit-taking.
*   The speaker teaches their students to "run down equity," which means:
    *   Every time a new low is created during a short trade, the trader should consider taking profits.
    *   This is because the trade is paying down a little bit more over time.
*   The speaker advises to expect continued movement below short-term lows *if* the market doesn't make a "big explosive capitulation" run into a predefined target.

### Reversal Signals & Liquidity Expansion

*   A failure to achieve a significant sell-off suggests a potential reversal.
*   The speaker teaches their students to recognize this and manage their trades accordingly.
*   Once a shift below a liquidity level (sell-side liquidity) occurs, the speaker looks for **expansion**, indicating strong momentum.
*   This expansion confirms the validity of the move.

### NASDAQ Revisited: Lows and Stop Runs

*   The speaker shifts back to **NASDAQ**, referencing a specific level: **13,029.75**.
*   The speaker points out a low that was broken, followed by a run-up to a certain point *without* taking out a previous high.
*   If the price drops again, the speaker wants to see that low "completely smoked" and disrespected, not just a small dip below it.
*   The speaker dislikes seeing price action where a low is taken, followed by another attempt to take the same low.
*   The speaker believes that such patterns often involve retail concepts like Wolf Waves or broadening formations (megaphone patterns).
*   The speaker is comfortable being wrong in these scenarios, as they are infrequent.

### Opportunity Identification & Expected Price Behavior

*   Over the years, the speaker has focused on identifying opportunities where price is expected to behave in a specific way.
*   Sell-side liquidity was already taken with a previous low and a subsequent price run.
*   If the price goes lower, it should do so without respecting that previous low.
*   Respecting the low would create a lower low followed by a higher low, potentially leading to a retracement or a complete run to the upside.
*   The NASDAQ is identified as the relatively stronger of the three averages (compared to ES and Dow).

### Dow Jones Analysis: An "Unruly Child"

*   The speaker mentions that they *don't trade the Dow*.
*   They describe the Dow as behaving "like a brat" or "an unruly child" because it often does what it wants and doesn't cleanly deliver price action.
*   ES is preferred, and sometimes NASDAQ, because they tend to be more predictable.

### ES Revisited: Range Extension & Fair Value Gap

*   The speaker directs the audience to forget about the Dow temporarily and focus on the price action in ES.
*   The speaker points out that the retracement might make traders uncomfortable if they were targeting a specific level.
*   It is necessary to extend ranges and consider the relevant fair value gap.
*   The fair value gap previously acted as support.
*   Now that the price is below it, the speaker doesn't want to see a trade above that fair value gap.

### Dow Jones Re-Examination: Animated Movement

*   The speaker returns to the Dow to clarify a point.
*   Since the Dow had already taken out stops at a previous low and rallied, any subsequent movement *below that low needs to be "animated."*
*   Animated is defined as extremely large range, speed, and distance.
*   The speaker refers to instances where, during live executions, they annotate the chart looking for "speed and distance."
*   They want to see a specific level be "railroaded through," completely disrespected, and run right through as if it wasn't even there.

### Contrasting Scenario: Turtle Soup Pattern

*   If the Dow *hadn't* already traded to that low, a different expectation would be in place.
*   The speaker would expect a "turtle soup" type pattern: a false break below, followed by a reaction.
*   They would *not* expect the low, if traded below, to perform like the "animated" scenario. It would likely give way immediately, allowing a run to a lower area.

### Intermarket Relationships and Market Breadth

*   The speaker emphasizes that they internalize how price is delivered.
*   If the Dow trades below the low, it might not even get back down to that level. This is problematic.
*   Ideally, all three averages (Dow, NASDAQ, and ES) should agree, reflecting simple Dow Theory and market breadth.
*   The goal is to see market environments where the signatures of risk-on or risk-off sentiment are easily identifiable.
*   The speaker notes that they aren't seeing that clearly today.

### Dow's Sell-Side Liquidity and Implications for ES & NASDAQ

*   The Dow has already had a run below a low, taking out sell-side liquidity (stopping out traders who were long).
*   Therefore, there's no real *need* for a further drop below that low, unless the market is determined to go significantly lower.
*   This information is used to manage expectations in ES and NASDAQ.
*   Traders may be best suited to take profits, as targets may not be fully reached.
*   The insight gleaned from the Dow's behavior influences trading decisions in the other indices.

### NASDAQ's Near Miss and Swing Target

*   The speaker returns to the NASDAQ, noting that it *did* trade below a recent low, offering an opportunity to take a partial profit.
*   However, there was no continuation downward.
*   The swing target, based on the fulcrum point concept, would only be valid if the low is broken.

### Time Correlation & the Dow

*   The speaker notes a specific time: **10:46 AM**, referencing the time of a particular candle on the NASDAQ.
*   They emphasize the importance of not trading in isolation on a single chart; traders need proper context.
*   At **10:46 AM**, a lower low was forming. The speaker discusses how the Dow might react to this.
*   They are watching to see if it has any willingness to break through its low.

### Market Dominance & the Dow's Significance

*   If the Dow *did* break that low, it would signal a potential capitulation.
*   It would "bend the knee" and fall in line with the selling pressure seen in ES and NASDAQ.
*   This is because the Dow only represents 30 stocks, compared to 100 in NASDAQ and 500 in ES.
*   The main point is that the prior run on stops on the Dow influences expectations.

### Stop Runs & Intermarket Dynamics

*   Because the Dow has *already* had a run on sell-side stops, traders should be wary of that low being taken out again.
*   Anyone who was long and had their stop loss trailed to that low would have already been stopped out.
*   The speaker allows for the possibility that the market might do this move anyway, but in their mind, they are weighing the probabilities.
*   The speaker teaches their students to weigh out these inter-market relationships between the three indices.
*   They don't focus on the Russell 2000 or other averages.
*   The primary focus is on price action in ES, Dow, and NASDAQ.

### Dow's Volatility & Notable Insight

*   Even though the speaker dislikes the Dow because it's a "brat" and doesn't always behave predictably, they still derive *valuable insight* from it.
*   This insight comes from the relationship to that low and its behavior.
*   The same logic would apply to any index, not just the Dow.
*   For instance, if the NASDAQ had the low and went to a lower low, the speaker would expect the Dow to aggressively take out that low with speed and distance.
*   The *failure* of the Dow to do so should prompt traders to take profits.
*   The speaker gave the example of the candle at **10:46 AM.**

### Partial Profits & Execution Logic

*   At the same time, when ES was trading lower and approaching that low on the Dow, traders *should* have been taking profits or partials.
*   The speaker references recordings of live executions, where best-case exits (targets) are displayed alongside partial profit-taking.
*   New traders may not understand why the speaker takes partials, but they are a crucial part of risk management.
*   The speaker dismisses "clowns" who say partials are stupid.
*   The speaker emphasizes that "partials pay every single time, 100% of the time."
*   Taking something off in profit *always* makes money.

### Trading Realities and Market Conditions

*   The speaker stresses that trading is not about getting the best entry and exit every time, as that's impossible.
*   There will always be factors that negatively affect performance, such as health, focus, and challenging market conditions.
*   The current market conditions are described as "very fickle."
*   The speaker prefers a fast and loose market, with symmetry and predictable movements.

### Objective Achievement & Trade Management

*   The speaker may not always reach their objective, as was shown previously.
*   These nuances are often missed in the condensed, 2-minute and 15-second clips shared on Twitter.
*   The explanation with the Dow provides the logic behind taking partials.

### Low Resistance Liquidity Runs & Trading Models

*   The speaker emphasizes the importance of being in trades that are "low resistance liquidity runs," where the price moves easily to the target like a hot knife through butter.
*   The speaker's tools and teachings help identify those conditions, but they don't exist every day.
*   The speaker's students often expect these conditions to be present every day because of the success they see in the examples.
*   *Here's an important point:*
    *   The *logic* of what the speaker teaches is present every day.
    *   *However,* the *specific trading model* (the trade idea, entry mechanism, multiplier) may not be there every session, day, or on that particular asset.
    *   It might exist somewhere else, in another asset.

### Focus & Intermarket Awareness

*   This is why the speaker discourages trading 28 different markets simultaneously.
*   It's better to limit focus to one or two closely correlated markets, like NASDAQ and ES.
*   In Forex, it was the British pound and the euro dollar, with the dollar index providing an inversely related view.

### Rationale & Trade Outcomes

*   Everything outlined above is a reason and justification for the type of move that happened in this example.
*   The speaker states that people who say "don't take partials" are likely to have been stopped out on the retracement, getting nothing for their time and effort.
*   The "greater fool" is the one who uses logic that yields a partial profit versus the one who insists that the stop loss is the only exit and the target is the only profit.

### Entry Confidence & Realism

*   The speaker states that it's really really placing a lot of demand on performance to get into a trade where you know that you got a solid entry, your stop losses unlikely to get hit, and you know for certain your targets getting hit because that's what's being promoted in this "don't take partials" logic.
*   The speaker believes in stating that in your infancy as a developing student and Trader, you know absolutely 100 percent that your Target's getting hit.

## Trading Psychology, Market Analysis, and Execution Insights

### Addressing Myopic Educators and Unrealistic Expectations

*   The speaker emphasizes the importance of discerning genuine educators from those who lack practical experience.
*   Criticizes the unrealistic approach of expecting new traders to exclusively target full profits or face stop-outs, arguing it fosters discouragement.
*   "Accept nothing less that my friends is too myopic that is someone that is posing as an educator but has really no idea what they're talking about."
*   "You can't take someone that's new a green horn right off the streets never done this before until then hope for your full Target or get stopped out and learn from it."

### The Importance of Taking Partials and Managing Emotions

*   The speaker advocates for taking partial profits, viewing them as small rewards that sustain traders through challenging market conditions.
*   Highlights that new traders often become discouraged by choppy price action and are lured away by the perceived success of others on social media.
*   **The speaker cautions against chasing fleeting trends** and emphasizes sticking to a proven logic that works well under specific market conditions.
*   Reiterates the purpose is to learn to interpret price action and control emotional responses.
*   **"whereas I teach if it gives you something to take off take it that little reward many times is the thing that carries you through the times that everybody goes through when they're learning how to do this."**
*   **"price actions like this this stuff right here this is the stuff that breaks the backs of new students they don't want to stay in in this they think there's something else better."**

### Recognizing When to Stay on the Sidelines

*   Stresses the significance of recognizing scenarios where pushing a button (entering a trade) is akin to gambling.
*   "you have to have a reason to be pushing a button but I'm showing you in these live streams that there are times when you don't want to push the button you don't want to do it because the logic behind having pushed it would be basically the equivalent to gambling."

### Analyzing Intermarket Relationships: NASDAQ, ES, and Dow

*   Points out a lower low on **NASDAQ** while noting contrasting behavior in **ES (E-mini S&P 500 futures)**.
*   Refers back to an earlier statement regarding the **Dow Jones Industrial Average** and its cleared sell-side liquidity.
*   "so you have a lower low here on NASDAQ but look at what's going on in es so we're all over the place let's go back to Dow okay remember what I said earlier about this low here we've already cleared out South Side so the only reason to come back down below that low is to completely wipe out all the movement higher on the Dow and that would accelerate the lower moves on ES and NASDAQ."

### Understanding Potential for Market Manipulation and Stop Runs

*   Identifies a potential scenario where a run-up is designed to trigger buy stops above previous highs, creating problems for **ES** moving lower.
*   **"but what's resting above these highs what's what's above these highs here what kind of stops and who's using that stuff shorts so how they protect a short position a buy stop so all this run up here is setting the stage for a ram above here which is problematic for ES moving lower."**

### Identifying Missed Targets and Warning Signs

*   Notes that price action failed to reach a previously identified imbalance, indicating a deviation from a symmetrical market condition.
*   **"so in a symmetrical perfect Market condition the market should have went right to that there and then rolled over none of this should happen."**
*   Highlights that although the market traded below sell-side liquidity, the move was short-lived, and the behavior of the Dow served as a warning sign.
*   Emphasizes the importance of recognizing when a target is unlikely to be reached.
*   "We did go lower we traded below the sell side here but that was very very short-lived and what was the warning sign what I showed you in the down real time explaining it to you why it's likely to be a factor in seeing the sustained price run lower on ES even though the target was identified how do you know when a target's not going to get there Michael."

### The Importance of Real-Time Observation and Intermarket Awareness

*   Stresses that these lessons cannot be conveyed through written material alone; they require real-time observation and practical application.
*   **"These are lessons I can't write in a paragraph I can't write a book and have chapters that talk about that you have to see me doing it like this because then it makes you'll remember this now because you saw it."**
*   Reiterates that traders should monitor the behavior of other averages when trading stock indices.
*   Emphasizes the significance of intermarket relationships in assessing the likelihood of a trade's continuation.
*   "If I'm going to price run and I'm going to trade it how is the other averages if I'm Trading use stock indices or you're treating stock indices let's say it that way how do you trust that the trades likely to continue well the things I'm telling you to look for but if you have these big Road you know bulletin boards like we saw in the Dow saying okay we're having difficulty here expecting it to go lower because the Dow already ran itself sign so if it's not likely to take that low out then you probably should be taking partials as it's careening into your target just take a partial because you might not get that Target filled and when you do get stopped out on your balance guess how it feels I mean money you didn't beat me that's what I think in my head all the time every single time I do that you didn't beat me you stopped me from getting all of what I was trying to get but I still took something off your rear end that's how I look at it."

### Trading as Warfare: A Gladiator Mentality

*   Frames trading as a battle, emphasizing the importance of securing a portion of the expected profit, even if the full target isn't reached.
*   **"so I don't look at his chess I look at it as Gladiators okay I'm stepping out there I'm putting my expectation in the marketplace and I'm in there warring like you are expecting to take home a pound of Flesh and I might not get a full pound I might get a quarter pound I might get a half a pound but they didn't take anything off of me and I don't feel any regret when the market trades against me and stops out my remaining balance."**
*   Expresses no regret when the market reverses, stopping out the remaining balance after partials are taken.

### Stop Placement and Risk Management

*   Advises against moving stop losses to breakeven or better until a partial profit has been secured.
*   Explains that new traders often prioritize avoiding losses, which hinders their progress.
*   **"as soon as you take partial then you reduce the stop you do not reduce your stop to break even or better until you take a partial that's a very hard thing to grow accustomed to as a new Trader because you're thinking I got to get the break even I got to get to protect myself I don't want to take a losing trade that needs to stop you need to stop worrying about that and the easiest way to get over that is learning what I'm teaching you to avoid the conditions like we're seeing here where it's iffy it's really hard for price to have these sustained price runs to reach into your targets without having this choppy retracements it's frustrating."**
*   The easiest way to get over that is learning avoidance in certain conditions.

### The Value of Mentorship in Mindset and Condition Identification

*   Mentorship is valuable to maintain your focus, in order to expect fluctuations that occur and see price paying out to a certain degree, unlike in **low resistance liquidity runs**.
*   **"so that's why I teach in a mentorship capacity most of the these lessons are to keep your mindset focused on yeah you can observe price action in these types of conditions yes you can expect some type of fluctuations and see it you know paying out to a certain degree but not like in low resistance liquidity runs where the market just simply lays it in your hands and asks you if you want more whereas this one when it's like this this is high resistance High Resistance liquidity runs yeah you get movement yeah you can probably see this in that painting out but you're not getting the full runs and everything is disjointed."**
*   A **symmetrical market** is where the dollar is going higher, and the NASDAQ, Dow and ES are moving lower with little consolidation or retracement. In this **risk-off scenario** price inefficiencies are respected.

### Trading Immaturity vs Maturity

*   Maturity is having experience that enables the ability to wait for better market conditions, as opposed to immaturity which is exemplified by thinking that the next trade will determine your entire trading career.
*   Maturity in understanding enables traders to not feel like a victim or that they have to do something.
*   **" but I know I can whatever I could do in an environment like this I can do 10 times more if I just wait to the next day or the day after that that's maturity that's experience you as a new student don't have that so you think that the only trade that's ever going to matter is the one you're about to take right now in your entire career rests upon the outcome of this next trade it sounds silly but if you really think about it that's exactly what you're doing I know it because I did that too and that was because I didn't know how to trade I didn't know how to read price I didn't know the consistency on how these things form multiple times over the course of a week and when you have this understanding and you have this experience you don't feel like a victim of your own emotions or you feel like you got to do something I gotta push a button I gotta do something no you don't who says you have to do anything well I'm saying you have to learn how to reprice and you have to form discipline and build self-control those are skill sets that happen by doing what we're doing here not one button was pushed no entry nothing I'm thankful that I've done nothing today I'm appreciative of the fact that I am aware still that these are conditions that are going to be problematic for me they may not be problematic for you you might have some kind of you know widget indicator or something that you're following and it's producing you some kind of mechanism that tells you to buy or sell and it gives you some type of a result at the end that tells you to get out of it and you made money well done you don't need to watch my videos I'm not teaching you how to follow an indicator okay I'm teaching you how to read price action naked the logic behind it why it should do certain things when it shouldn't do it and I promise you if you learn how to do that that's much more reassuring than any indicator because every indicator has a period of where it just goes into a tailspin that's the that's the only reason why I dropped indicators because I was always in the pursuit of trying to change the settings the ideal optimal calibration no you're trying to form fit just like I was trying to form fit when I was trying to do that too."**

### Price Action Above All Else

*   Price is only doing one of two things: going higher or lower.
*   Going higher is happening for buyside or it's going up to a premium imbalance. Going lower happens below an old low or into a discount inefficiency.
*   Stop worrying about all these things and just read what's price time to do it it's only doing one of two things okay it's going to go higher or it's going to go lower if it's not going to consolidate and we don't want to be doing any consolidation trading but if it's not consolidating you take that out of the equation it's only do one or two things go higher or go lower and it's only going to go higher for one of two things it's going to go up for buy side where it's going to go up to a premium imbalance that's going to reprice to if it's going to go lower it's going to go down below an old low or lows for sell side or it's going to go down into some discount inefficiency it's a fair value and that's easy folks but what's hard is knowing the climate that you're looking at right now how to determine if the Market's really likely to pan out and have a really nice run for you that's a skill set that is not taught by anybody else believe me I've spent fortunes on books and courses and I'm telling you nobody teaches this nobody does they're always trying to sell you some kind of gimmick to get into a trade some kind of pattern some kind of logic to get you into something because they're trying to appeal to your natural tendencies to do what push the button where it takes a lot of effort on my part to try to slow everybody's expectations down when they first come to me because you need to have patience and if I go in there and start teaching you buy and selling entry points all I'm going to do is ensure that you fail faster without understanding why you should take that buy or sell in the first place."

### Entry Points Vs Market Direction

*   The framework for trading should be centered on 10 handle runs as a framework for trades, even if only trying to achieve 5 handles. 
*   "what matters more your entry point or where the Market's going because if you know where it's going and you're using a framework that allows for enough of a range remember I was telling you earlier in the presentation that I teach my students to focus on 10 handle run as the framework for the trade even if you're only trying to get five handles because it allows a lot of forgiveness for you in your infancy as a Trader you don't know what you don't know right now like you don't realize the the vacuum of insight that you need that you want to have consistency with but you haven't adopted the things that resulted to that outcome and you're trying to avoid the things that are necessary for you to in engage yourself with which is getting in in tough market conditions because these conditions here are going to teach you a lot about who you are and what things are going to be problematic in your trading in patients imposing your will forcing something that isn't there chasing price once it starts moving if you do those things in this type of Market environment you're going to lose you're going to blow your account you're going to lose your funded account you're going to be very frustrated I don't put you in front of the charts when it's like this just to torture you I'm teaching you this is what you're trying to avoid in the times that are not presenting the market conditions like this you'll see it's a lot easier and you do most of your work there but you exercise patience and discipline in these Market environments you tell yourself I'm not expecting a big explosive type of Market move here and you watch what price does and you put yourself in the situation that if you are short how would you feel about your short if you were long how would you feel about your long what would you want to see happen and you go through that internal dialogue while you're watching price you're not trying to be right about anything but the experience that you get by watching price paint like this without any monetary connection whether it be a demo trade or paper trade or a funded account or a live account all you're trying to do is determine what your mind what your psychology about what you're seeing in price action is telling you as the person not the trader because you're not the trader yet you're just learning but what are you focusing on do you feel well do you feel like you missed something that's impatience do you feel like you should get in here right now and push a demo well that is impulsiveness they're going to manifest themselves in your real trading and unless you learn coping mechanisms to overcome that and replace it with real positive things that counteract those impulsiveness impatience gambling chasing price okay fearing missing a move getting in after it's already ran eight handles yeah I see a fair value it could go down there but what if it doesn't let me just buy it now and it goes down the fair value God all those things you need to know what you're going to feel internally you may not have any of the things I just mentioned but chances are you probably have at least two and you need to recognize that before you put money at risk too many people want to get here and just start making money and you can't consistently do that if you don't discover who you are and how you're going to derail yourself and the only way you can determine that is not by reading a book either written by me in the future or anyone else's or buying a course or using an indicator based strategy that they create or authored or you know sell or Market or whatever all those things are going to keep you distracted from finding where your problems are because they're always internal every single losing trade has one common denominator it's them they did it they pushed themselves in the trade they put themselves in a trade that they knew if they were honest that it was probably not gonna work it's not gonna work but you just don't have the courage discipline and self-control to stop turn the charts off and come back another time when it's more likely to paint out in your favor because you don't have that so you're thinking I sat in front of these charts I put all this time into it and what do I have to show for it we didn't even do anything we haven't pushed a button haven't done nothing but you've learned how to do what manage a trade idea if we're looking for lower prices how do we know that it's not likely to continue before it reverses on you that's what I outlined today the last live stream I did I picked a condition I said you know here's a here's a low probability condition so I already warned you ahead of time telling you this is something I would not take a trade on but we're going to force an ID on it okay we're going to push it into the marketplace and we're going to say this is a fair value Gap and we're going to say that this is where we would go short just watch the live stream you'll hear and see it and then it would have resulted in a trade that didn't really pan out but we learned real time how we say okay this is not what it should be doing it traded outside the the lines and the"

### Discovering Derailment and The Common Denominator

*   The only way to determine derailment is not by reading a book, buying a course, or using an indicator, but by discovering who you are, and understanding how you're going to derail yourself. 
*   Every single losing trade has one common denominator: you.

### Trade Management: Stop Loss Reduction and Partial Exits

*   The speaker discusses trade management strategies, including adjusting stop losses and taking partial profits.
*   Elaborates on techniques for reducing stop loss without moving it.
*   "so we could collapse the trade and have a very small loss just like I teach in partials with profits I teach and taught in that live stream real time where you can take your stop loss and reduce it without moving it."
*   They teach about taking your stop loss and reducing it without moving it.
*   The speaker then references their earlier approach to trading as a 20-year-old.
    *   Explains how they would struggle with admitting being wrong.
    *   Instead of closing the trade or taking partials, they would move their stop loss or remove it entirely.
*   **"I'm not willing to take a full stop out where in that trade I would have been a full stop and I even talked about when I was a 20 year old where I would wrestle with the idea instead of saying I'm wrong and either close the trade take partials off not in profit but take partials in terms of the position size and reduce it to which would otherwise be a reduction in exposed risk I didn't want to do that as a 20 year old so I would move my stop or remove it entirely"**
*   The speaker suggests that the price action should indicate when to exit a trade to minimize losses.
*   Uses NASDAQ as an example of a buy setup that mitigated an earlier loss.
*   Describes how the initial market, ES, then moved favorably, reinforcing the importance of patience and analysis.
*   **"but you heard me explain how that is not what you've shown us you should see that in price so therefore you would collapse the trade here and then I moved over to NASDAQ and it's okay here's a buy and then showed you how it went up and that would have covered and mitigated that loss and then you can go back to the original chart or Market that you're following which was yes and then we watched it go up and you know panned out you know like gangbusters"**

### The Limitations of Traditional Trading Education

*   The speaker asserts that these real-time lessons cannot be effectively taught through conventional methods like books or courses.
*   Emphasizes the unique value of live sessions for demonstrating practical application.
*   **"those are the lessons you can't learn from a book and nobody includes those lessons in their courses because trust me I bought just about everything that's available I don't buy it anymore ever since 2007 or eight I think it was the last time I bought anything and I was really just buying it just to see what they were doing see if any of my stuff was creeping into things now everything has got my stuff in it but it's incomplete because these types of lessons I can't I can't communicate it effectively in like a like a book format"**
*   The speaker refers to the live sessions in future books, providing context and examples that are more impactful than static charts.
*   **"so the things that I can't teach in the books that I'm writing I'm including in these live sessions because I'm going to refer to them by date in the books so that we can see I'm referring back to something I talked about in these in these very live sessions so that way it kind of gives you a greater context in example versus if I just showed you a chart that's static you weren't here you weren't there at the time where now you can see this is what it was like this is we were watching this is what was impactful at that time"**
*   Reflects on how they wish they had been mentored in this way earlier in their career.
*   **"if I would have learned like this I would have been far better sooner so I try to teach in a way where if I could go back and be the mentor to myself that's who I'm talking to and then again I'm talking really to my child"**
*   Notes that traders who advocate against partials were likely caught off guard, while those with experience could anticipate market movements.

### Market Analysis: NASDAQ, ES, and Dow Examples

*   The speaker identifies buy-side liquidity targets around 4142 and three-quarters.
*   Analyzes **NASDAQ**, identifying an inversion fair value gap (IFVG).
    *   Explains that an **IFVG** should be treated like support or resistance.
    *   Suggests that if the price trades above it and then comes back down, it might find support at the IFVG level before expanding upward.
    *   Points out buy-side liquidity levels in the area.
*   **"so that buy side up here at 4142 and three quarters that's where we're looking to see go and let's take a look at the NASDAQ see how she's behaving all right so we're back up into that fair value gut now this we would treat this now as a inversion Fair Value Guide so you sent you seen many times I f v g that's inversion treat it like would you expect your support resistance idea where it's a specific one level um this is the actual thing that would act as support resistance so if we trade above it come back down might see a candle touch it or whatever and expand up and work into this area here there's buy side there and there's buy side here"**
*   Examines the **Dow Jones Industrial Average**, noting buy-side liquidity and relative equal highs.
    *   Recalls a previous warning sign: sell stops had already been taken after a pass below a low.
    *   Interprets the current movement as a retracement.
*   **"let's go and look at the dowel we had buy side then our crosshairs on that one and there we go relative equal highs I told you what would be above that my side what was the warning sign we already seen cell stops taken on this pass below that low so this is just a retracement lower"**

### Practical Application: Trade Management in Real-Time

*   The speaker discusses how the analysis of the Dow influences trade management for ES and NASDAQ.
*   Advises taking partial profits due to warning signs that the market is unlikely to move lower.
*   Recommends taking off a significant portion of the position (e.g., 50%).
*   Justifies this by stating that if the market does go lower, the trader still has half the position.
*   **"how much how much of a partial do you think you would have taken given the context I was outlining real time with this this low in relationship to that well having already seen the stealth stops you would take 50 percent you don't take your lowest partial off you take a large portion off because you have warning signs that it's not likely to do what it's not likely to go lower but if it does that's great you have the half of your position still on in the short on ES or short on the NASDAQ"**
*   The speaker expresses that they would have valued this type of real-time instruction highly.
*   Stresses that this kind of insight requires active engagement and cannot be fully grasped from written material alone.
*   **"telling you folks I mean I would have paid a fortune for learning how to read it like this and no buttons are being pushed but you're gaining all kinds of insight that this can't be appreciated until you see what it feels like to have it the next time you look at Price action you have experience that you can lean on it's not the same as if I write a book or chapter you can't just take that information from the pages and walk out here into the charts and feel like you're connected to it it's not the same experience"**
*   Emphasizes that watching live price action reveals potential trading pitfalls.
*   Highlights the focus of their mentorship: filling the void in trading education that addresses common challenges faced by developing traders.
*   **"whereas watching price action and seeing the things they're going to creep into your Trading you think about how many times have you read a book things that are going to be problematic to your trades and why and how they form that's chapters I'm writing but they're now they're not there in books right now everything that I do in my mentorship is along the lines of those types of things I'm filling the void that everybody else has it doesn't matter if you like me or don't like me it doesn't matter if you are profitable or unprofitable with your strategies the things that are permeated in everybody's experience as a developing student of price action or Trader we all go through these things and we all know the things that we hate about trading"**

### Addressing Common Trading Frustrations

*   The speaker acknowledges common frustrations among traders, such as waiting for setups and perceived wasted time.
*   Argues that time spent in front of the charts is valuable for new traders to study price action, timing, and market dynamics.
*   Notes the importance of understanding time references, setup formations, and the draw on liquidity.
*   **"you hate having to wait for the setup you hate having had sat in front of all these charts and time wasted in your mind but you're not wasting time when you're new you should be in front of the charts you should be there looking at watching how price paints studying the time references and where these setups form where does it turned how far does it go where's it gravitate to where's the draw in liquidity how much drawdown was there once the formation occurs for your entry your multiplier your PDA forms how much time does it take to get to that buy side or that sell side in deference to the short holders those things are impactful"**
*   Acknowledges the impact of social media's short attention spans on trading habits.
*   Explains that focusing on candlestick analysis helps maintain attention and balance.
*   **"because you're going to see when I show a trade example I'm I'm catering to the short attention span that social media has cultivated in everyone now I mean I have a very short attention to span too it makes it very hard for me to focus on any one thing I'm easily distracted but when I'm talking about candlesticks my attention is focused so I can kind of be a little bit more balanced than normally am if I wasn't doing this if I was just out here talking like on a Twitter space and I go off the rails and my mind just runs but here it allows me to keep my focus on the context of what I believe prices do in the internal dialogue I'm sharing with you real time"**

### The Value of Button-Free Studying

*   The speaker stresses the importance of studying price action without actively trading.
*   Emphasizes that this approach fosters self-investment and unique experience.
*   **"but you you have no idea the impact of studying without pushing a button is going to have on you until you start doing it it's not wasting time you're investing in yourself and you're rewarding yourself with experience that you can't get any other way you can't there's no other way to obtain this except for being in front of the charts and studying it real time in measuring how you"**
*   Points out that each trader brings their own unique problems and reactions to the market.
*   Encourages traders to observe their emotional responses to price action, such as anger or frustration, as indicators of internal issues.
*   Notes the limitations of books in identifying and correcting these personal challenges.
*   **"you each one of you listening to me are going to bring to this endeavor your own problems but you don't want to see them as problems until they manifest in your charts your trading your perspective and how you react to what price is doing are you mad about what has happened today are you angry that it didn't didn't do a specific thing that's showing you something about yourself and books don't do an efficient job of dealing with identifying that number one and two how do you correct it because that's exactly what's going to undo you that's the thing that's going to be in your way it's not the fact that these Concepts don't work because they do it's not because the logic is flawed because it isn't flawed it's what you're doing with the information what are you doing with this information are you abusing and using it outside the rules and context that was presented to you"**
*   States most students that have issues trade outside the context.
*   Trading a five-minute trade basis will not provide success.
*   The speaker discusses how mentorship students are placed in situations to watch price action to get a true feel of the markets.
*   Those who are weak minded will quit as opposed to the ones that endure and are successful.

### Overcoming Personal Obstacles and Market Realities

*   The speaker asserts that failures stem from misuse of information, often due to external influences or impatience.
*   Highlights that successful students endure rigorous observation without active trading, treating it as a serious investment.
*   The speaker warns that the market efficiently removes those with a "trash mentality."
*   **"99 of the time if any of my students had that that's exactly what they've done or they listen to somebody else that has dollar menu mentorships and they want to do everything on a five-minute trainer basis and they you can't condense this these are the things that you have to go through and this is exactly what I was putting my mentorship students through who paid me they had to sit here and watch me Jawbone about the price action and because there was no button being pushed the weak-minded individuals would quit the ones that endured it they're the ones you're seeing now that are being interviewed they went through all of this and they did it when I wasn't doing it too they took it serious they treated it like a business in an investment in themselves and if you don't have those characteristics in yourself you have to develop them otherwise you will be removed this business has an efficient way of taking out the trash and if you come in here with a trash mentality that it's going to be easy for you and it's owed to you to be fast and quick you're going to be treated like trash you're gonna be taken out in the bin and there's nothing you can do about it until you change how you think"**
*   Shares their personal experience of overcoming similar challenges through diligence, organization, and disciplined expectations.
*   Emphasizes the importance of identifying repeating patterns that influence market conditions.

### The Value of Experienced Guidance

*   The speaker believes others that teach their methodology do not deserve the credit that is received because they have not endured the struggles.
*   The speaker says they would pay 10x more to have the experience of being shown the ropes.
*   The speaker reflects on past mistakes and the difficulty of letting go of initial expectations.
*   Connects this to the common pitfall of forcing trades even when the market deviates from the initial analysis.
*   **"I had to endure that too I didn't like it it wasn't pleasurable it wasn't fun I tried to hide it I tried to pretend it wasn't really there I tried to blame everything I was learning and it was me and then when I corrected those things and replaced them with being diligent organized placing limitations on what I'm expecting to see in price action what do I want to see which shouldn't take place and then spending time identifying the things that repeated that caused or negated those conditions being in price that's the workload that everybody else that tries to teach my stuff doesn't deserve the credit they receive because they didn't endure anything they're just echoing me and you're echoing just the small portion of it this is the stuff this is the stuff that I would have paid 10 times what I'd charge for mentorship just to have experience shown to me like this because these are the things that I hurt myself with not knowing these things not knowing these things and allowing a very small little disruption an idea that I was trying to make happen in the charts and I wouldn't let go of it wouldn't feel comfortable with changing directions well I had to learn that skill I had to learn to let go of an idea that I may have started the day with"**
*   Asks the audience to acknowledge if they have experienced similar scenarios of persistent, loss-inducing trades.
*   Explains that such experiences create "scar tissue" that negatively impacts future trading decisions.

### Minimizing Risk and Maximizing Learning

*   Advocates learning through demo accounts to minimize financial risk and maximize understanding.
*   Believes in using a demo account to learn without any pain.
*   States a high probability and low risk day does not have the trade.
*   Highlights that fluctuations in price do not mean taking the trade.
*   Stresses the importance of recognizing situations where a trade lacks strong conviction and carries unnecessary risk.
*   **"that one moment isn't limited to the drawdown or the blown account you now have scar tissue and it's going to impact every trade that you take the rest of your career and you want to minimize scar tissue in the beginning which is the reason why I teach through demo you don't have any reason to be upset but you have all the upside in terms of understanding and learning you have pain-free learning except for pride and for men for men it hurts worse something would probably cut their pinky out before they had their pride hurt so look at this day what do you see here that frames very very high probability in low risk it's not there folks it's not there's fluctuation in price price changed yes there was a rate of change from high and lows yes that occurred absolutely it occurred definitely I'm not denying that I'm not arguing that but what here in price action screams at you that I should have taken this trade and I would have felt strong convictions about having done so and had no fear I wouldn't be impacted by the slow lethargic price action before it moves the back and forth choppiness that it trades back inside of a four and a half five handle consolidation for it moves that's the that's the difficulty in teaching with static price action showing you a screenshot saying look at this look at this look at this"**

### The Importance of Real-Time Education and Observation

*   Critiques the ineffectiveness of static price action examples for teaching trading skills.
*   Reiterates that shared PDFs were intended for students to record personal observations during live sessions.
*   Acknowledges that the current discussion may be boring to some, but valuable for dedicated learners.
*   Highlights the significance of understanding *why* price is behaving a certain way.
*   **"is the reason why I told everybody in my PDFs that were being shared and leaked when I was doing paid mentorship that doesn't it doesn't work for you okay it doesn't work the PDFs were just for students to write their own observations and notes what they felt when we were doing the lesson at that time just like this right here everything I've talked about here it probably bored the socks off of some of you and you probably already turned the video off and you probably can't even telling you this part but the other individuals that are still here you have exactly what it takes to learn this you're here you're here when it's not a reason to push a button you're here understanding what it is I'm teaching explaining to you why price is behaving the way it is and you want to know this in the beginning it doesn't feel like you it's a skill that you should aspire to have but we're learning what not to do is the most important thing"**
*   Compares trading education to learning how to skydive, emphasizing the need for thorough preparation and understanding of potential risks.
*   Stresses that trading should not be an adrenaline rush, but a calculated response to market conditions.
*   **"imagine we're learning how to skydive you wouldn't want me as a skydiving instructor I'm scared to death of heights but you know they teach you all the procedures about safety and you never got an airplane yet how's your parachute packed how do you pull the parachute what happens if your shoot doesn't open what happens if there's a problem with your parachute what's the procedure what do you do use your reserve so they're teaching you that in advance so that way when you do for some stupid reason I don't know why anybody would jump out of a perfectly good airplane but hey everybody finds their own Thrills and seeks in the way they want to do it right don't treat trading like that it should not be an adrenaline rush but you do need to have those procedures in place and understand what it is you're doing and why you're going to be responding to the market and as I said responding not reacting to price"**
*   The speaker stresses the difference between responding versus reacting to price.
*   Reinforces the concept of *responding* to the market's climate and conditions, rather than *reacting* impulsively to price movements.
*   Highlights that reacting to price is chasing.
*   The willingness in price demonstrates the closing of a trade as opposed to being stubborn.
*   The speaker questions why one should incur risk against their idea due to the time that was put into the trade.
*   The speaker believes this invites a loss and you will never be able to take the information that was presented.
*   **"we're responding to the market and what it's presenting in terms of climate and condition we're not reacting to price to get into a trade now we can respond to what price is showing us and an unwillingness to do a specific thing and then we may close a trade or take a large portion of our existing position off but we're not reacting to price to get into a trade we're not because that's chasing we're not chasing price we're anticipating specific things and if the things are not panning out why should you push the button if everything is moving against you and the idea that you're expecting to see unfold and it's not really moving all that much why should you be incurring risk because you're going to equate that you put time in front of the chart so therefore I got to get something out of this so why do you want to open the invitation for a loss how are you going to feel about it then you'll never be able you'll never be able to take the information that was presented"**

## Trading Psychology, Market Analysis, and Real-Time Observation

### The Pitfalls of Impulsive Trading

*   The speaker cautions against impulsive trading, especially after gaining insights from the session.
*   Taking a trade impulsively and losing can negate the value of the information gained, replacing it with a negative experience.
*   **"if you go and say okay I've had enough of this guy talking I'm just going to go and take a trade and then you take that trade and you lose everything that you would have retained as insight useful information you now have replaced with a negative experience"**
*   The speaker expresses concern that the trader's impulsiveness prevents them from benefiting from the mentorship experience.
*   Emphasizes the importance of enduring "dry spells" in learning, even though they might seem less appealing.
*   Traders often want immediate action and profit, leading them to force trades that lack sound logic.
*   **"but your impulsiveness your reluctance in allowing yourself to go through this experience which is normal mentorship this is exactly what it is if you do anything learning there's those dry spells of things that are most important but nobody wants to go through it they want to get right to the brass tacks the nuts and bolts give me the the action I want to get out there and start making money and you'll see stuff that isn't there"**
*   Impatience forces traders to make decisions based on flawed logic, imposing their will on the market.
*   **"you'll see something in charts that isn't likely to really produce much at all you'll force it like an ink blot you'll see what you want to see you'll manifest the very thing that you want to be there and it's not there you're imposing your will your impatience is forcing you to make a decision about something that is not Sound Logic"**

### Market Analysis: Dollar Index, ES, and NASDAQ

*   The speaker notes the New Week Opening Gap high at **4140.5**.
*   It's approximately 20 minutes before the lunch hour (noon). The speaker plans to stay until noon.
*   Analyzing the **Dollar Index**, the speaker identifies buy-side liquidity resting around **102.22**.
    *   Specifically, **102.23**, **102.22,** and **102.225**.
*   **"I'm looking at the dollar Index dollar Index has buy side resting around 102 20. 23. 22 and a half"**
*   Notes that **Euro** and **Cable** have been relatively inactive.
    *   **"Euro and cable have just basically marked time hasn't done much at all today"**
*   Monitors the low of the New Week Opening Gap at **4137** and its consequent encroachment at **4138.75**.
*   The speaker refers to a shaded area in gray, representing the current week's trading range (Sunday's open vs. Friday's close).
    *   They explain why they don't favor this particular New Week Opening Gap in their own analysis.
    *   Prefers the New Week Opening Gap with **4150.5** and **4137**.
    *   **"watch watch the low of that new week opening gap which is at 4137 in here and consequent encroachment between the two let me show you where that is because I don't have it highlighted I only have it on the charts to show you the the levels that we would have it on your chart 38 and three quarters that's consequent encouragement of the old new week opening Gap remember that shaded area in Gray that's the present week where we stopped trading on Friday last week versus where we open up on Sunday I am not in favor of that"**
*   Mentions that they had a discussion in a previous stream discussing the reasoning for it.
*   After sell-side liquidity has been taken, the speaker quickly analyzes **NASDAQ** and **Dow Jones.**
*   Notes that if price breaks below **33,812** on the **Dow**, it could target lower levels.
*   Has an interest in how the Dollar Index trades around **102.22**.
*   If the **Dollar Index** rallies, the willingness to break below a low would inform partial profit-taking on ES or NASDAQ shorts.
    *   Recommends taking off **50%**.
    *   Due to decoupling across the three averages (ES, NASDAQ, DOW).
    *   **"if we were to break lower and that would be you would need to go below this low right here okay so below 33 812 That Could set the stage for a run in here if dollar runs higher which I'm not all that terribly excited about but I do have an interest at 102.22 how it trades there if at all and what do I mean by that what I was outlining earlier and we were watching this low here does it have a willing to get below that and how we use that information was partials would be taken optimally with the es or NASDAQ shorts and how much 50 of it because we have decoupling across all three averages"**
*   Notes a volume imbalance that has already been traded to.

### Technical Setup and Tools

*   The speaker clarifies which Mouse they are using; a touchpad on an HP Specter laptop.
*   The laptop only has one USB port being used for the microphone.
*   Observing a reaction, the speaker wants to see a trade below a certain level to indicate sell-side activity.
    *   Sell-side liquidity is present at the level.
    *   Larger portion of liquidity is below.
    *   **"but we're seeing a nice reaction here we want to see it trade below here so sell side is here in a larger portion of cell side is now here"**
*   If price accelerates below the low, it triggers stops and targets sell-side liquidity in the PM session.
*   If the Dollar Index rallies, Cable is drifting lower, but the speaker is not overly enthusiastic.

### Conditioning Through Observation

*   Reminds the audience that tape reading is a form of conditioning.
*   The goal is to make trading boring, removing hyperventilation, heart palpitations, nervousness, and agitation.
*   These negative emotions are self-inflicted and can be prevented by conditioning oneself to read price action without monetary risk.
*   **"as a reminder when you're looking at the tape reading like this what this is doing is conditioning because you're probably very bored right now and that's exactly what you want your trading to be you want your trading to be boring you don't want it to be you know reason for you to be hyperventilating you don't want to feel any heart palpitations nervousness sweaty Palms agitated you want to you want to be comfortable not feeling like every instance that a new candle forms or every second it Ticks by the impending doom is just looming that's what you're trying to do to yourself with trying to trade with real money or a funded account or try to get a funded account before you know what you're doing this is how you condition yourself this is how you remove all of those things that plague every single Trader out there"**
*   Efficiency, consistency, and emotional detachment are key.
*   Avoid peacocking or seeking another trade immediately after a win, as this indicates dopamine addiction.
*   The biggest hit of dopamine only last for three or four minutes.
*    If one feels impulsive after a win, stop trading and analyze the outcome later to assess potential regret.
*   **"when you say okay well that did what I was expecting to do and the model worked here wonderful and when you don't have the impulse to go in again because you felt good and you want to get another one because if that's how you feel you're addicted to the dopamine in winning trades give the biggest hit of dopamine but it only lasts apparently for like three or four minutes because right away You're Gonna feel impulsive like oh there's another one let me get in here and do another one I'm on I got I'm on a roll today no stop turn the charts off and go do something else and then come back and see what it did and then that's a learning experience"**
*   Experiencing regret after a profitable trade and feeling as though you should not be trading with live funds.
*   The speaker reflects on the time it took to recognize these patterns in their own behavior.

### Lunchtime Liquidity Dynamics

*   Price consolidates lower, the liquidity resides where those who profited going lower are placing stops.
*   During the lunchtime hour (going into 1:30 PM New York time), price typically runs against the positions or stop placements established in the AM session.
*   **"we have seen this morning price drift in a consolidation lower where is the liquidity at for those individuals that have made money going lower about here and we're right here so the way this works in lunchtime Trading is the the lunchtime hour going into 1 30 near focal time typically not every time typically majority of time let's say it that way the run during the lunch hour up to 130 will be a run against the positions or where stops would be placed on the bulk of what was seen in the AM session"**
*   The algorithm seeks to reprice to introduce liquidity at the highs formed during the AM session.
*   Annotating charts to mark these levels is crucial.
*   The speaker mentions a student who taught them a shortcut: highlighting, holding the control key, and dragging to clone an item.
*   Expresses gratitude for helpful students who have taught them various tools, tips, and hotkeys in TradingView.
*   Despite knowing shortcuts, the speaker prefers manual plotting for deeper engagement and critical thinking, rather than relying solely on indicators.
*   **"I'm not impatient I'm not lazy I don't need an indicator to apply everything for me I like plotting it myself because that means I'm thinking about it in the Air Care might be flawed they might do something wrong it might refer to something incorrectly I don't have any faith in it and again I'm not lazy so"**
*   Recalls writing charts manually with the high, low, and close values.

### Price Action and Market Structure Analysis

*   Observing two down-closed candles trading into a fair value gap and back into consequent encroachment.
*   Notes the **38.75** level which represents the midpoint between the old New Week Opening Gap high and low.
*   Wants to see accumulation near the midpoint, having already trapped into the high of the down-closed candles (order block).
*   **"we have two down closed candles here trading into a fairway you got trading back up into consequent encroachment remember the 3875 level which was midpoint between the old new week opening high and all week old week knew it good grief old new week opening got low half of that is consequent encroachment so it's like the midpoint so we would like to see it accumulate here because we've already trapped into the high of the down closed candles here that's an order block we also have consequent encouragement we want to see it perform where it wants to drive up to the high of 41 40 and a half in an attack the buy side here"**
*   If the market moves up to **4140.5**, wants to see speed and distance to run for orders above that level.
*   Identifies a small fair value gap and buy-side liquidity resting above that high.
*   Under present market conditions and structure, does not want to see price trade below **4137** (New Week Opening Gap).
*   **"if you're pushing buttons you're doing it wrong you know okay so I have a small little fair value got and buy side resting right above that high here so we'll do that again here okay so in present Market conduct uh conditions and structure we don't want to see price trade below the low at 41.37 that's the new week opening Gap that's an old one but nonetheless it's still there we want to see if it can go down there we don't want to see it give up that level"**
*   Forecasting direction and behavior in price.
*   Wants to see the range between the high of the candle and the low of the candle remain open, acting as a breakaway gap.
*   **"we want to see that range between New Leaf opening Gap low and this low of this candle we want to see that remain open that would act as a breakaway Gap so we're kind of forecasting not only a Direction but we're also trying to forecast a behavior in price"**
*   Anticipates a potential move up to the buy-side liquidity if the market trades favorably.
*   The speaker will step away from the charts briefly.

### Market Decoupling and Expected Behavior

*   At **102.22** the **Dollar Index** level has been reached.
*   **Euro** looks like it wants to trade down to **109.2**.
*   Cable has sell-side liquidity at **1.24**.
*   The speaker wants to see it trade to the buy side.
*   Dollar is expanding higher and ES is rallying, which is not typical, but still possible.
    *   **"now it's against the order of everything now just so you understand what we're looking at dollar is expanded higher rallying in es that's not something you would expect to see it can't happen but it's problematic it's high resistance conditions we have cable going lower Euro softer"**
*   Described the conditions as high resistance conditions.
*   **Cable** is moving lower, and **Euro** looks soft.
*   **NASDAQ** has the low has been taken and there has not been a lot of movement lower with big ranges.
*   If **NASDAQ** falls victim to the lunchtime hour move, the buy-side liquidity would be above the highs.
*   ES is rallying against a rallying Dollar and falling FX pairs, indicating a nonsymmetrical market.
    *   Describes this as a decoupling.
    *   **"back to BS Salesman take this off I apologize Euros reaching for that sell side I mentioned a moment to go I'll give you a candle here in reference 825 is low at 109.6 es is rallying against uh rallying dollar and falling FX pairs this is not a symmetrical Market it's a decoupling that means everything is not in agreement can't doesn't mean you can't trade it I gave the logic and the framework you know based on that newly opening Gap what we would expect to see what would be favorable"**
*   This doesn't prevent trading, as the logic and framework have been provided based on the New Week Opening Gap.
*   Buy side has been taken.
*   Advises lightening up annotations to focus on active levels.
*   Discusses market conditions in the 1990s, characterized by smaller daily ranges, in contrast to the current high volatility.

## Market Analysis, Trading Psychology, and Algorithmic Influence

### Volatility, Patience, and Market Awareness

*   The speaker prefers waiting for opportunities where the market is likely to create a larger magnitude of a move.
    *   The speaker is comfortable waiting because they know what they are looking for.
    *   **"was very small and contracted so I'm I'm not afraid of these days I just choose to wait for when I know that the Mark is likely to create a larger magnitude of a move and I know what I'm looking for so I know I can be patient and wait for it"**
*   The speaker notes that new traders often struggle with patience.
    *   New traders are more prone to impulsive decisions due to a lack of experience and understanding of market dynamics.
    *   They often believe every day will be a significant trading day.
    *   **"where you if you're new and you don't know what you're looking for and you fall victim to yourself you get impulsive you you don't you don't know how to wait you think every day is going to be a big day so you go in there and you plunge doing something you shouldn't do but not realizing you shouldn't do it maybe because you're too too new"**

### New Week Opening Gap Analysis and Market Structure

*   The speaker identifies the current New Week Opening Gap, distinguishing it from one they disregard.
    *   The shaded area on the chart represents the current New Week Opening Gap.
    *   **"but we're back at this this is the current present new week opening Gap again that shaded area Okay so that way we're distinguishing the difference between that one which I don't care for I don't have any respect for this is the one I was referring to here"**
*   The speaker refers to specific price levels (**4137**).
    *   A limit is placed on how far they want to see the price go down.
    *   **"now let me take you back into what I was saying when we were right here I want to see it come back a little bit it can go down into this range we don't want to see it go down below the 4137 level so there's a limit okay I want to see price go down below this low but I do not want to see it go down to this low and lower it can go to that low but it's better if it doesn't why did I say that I said that if it stays open partially here it would act as a breakaway Gap allowing for even against a higher running dollar even against lower moves in euro dollar and cable"**
*   Explains the rationale behind wanting price to remain partially open within a specific range.
    *   This would act as a breakaway gap, potentially allowing for movement even against the backdrop of a higher-running dollar or lower moves in Euro/Dollar and Cable.
*   The speaker frames the analysis within the context of the Fair Value Gap.
    *   The Fair Value Gap is limited and framed on the basis of the New Week Opening Gap low of **4137**.
    *   **"ICT I'm not a Forex Trader it doesn't matter we're measuring risk on risk off the movement in here below that low inside of this area here so what I was really framing was what the fair value Gap limited and framed on the basis of the new week opening Gap low of 41.37 and this low right here see that"**
*   The speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding the New Week Opening Gap concept.
    *   Without this understanding, traders might misinterpret imbalances and potential order blocks.
    *   **"now if you don't have my new week opening Gap concept if you're not interested in it if you're not looking for if you don't have it on your chart if you're not aware of it you won't have this context you'll just see that imbalance and you might look at this opening on this candle here and draw it out and think okay if it touch it there I'll buy that as an order block when in reality what you should be seeing is it can trade down there but we are waiting for something to unfold that leaves a portion of this entire range open but framed on what basis this new week opening got low"**
*   Analysis of price action around the **4138** level.
    *   The low on the candle comes in at **4137.75**.
    *   Notes that the price needs to go one tick below **4138** to get that book.
    *   **"and what else is existing we have a wick so Watch What Happens 4138 even the low on this candle comes in at 41.37 and three quarters that means to get that book of 4138 it's got to go one tick below it the difference between it then you ask the reaction off that Wick and here's your favorite value you got using the context of the new week opening Gap low which is this here okay we're trading down Falls just sorted by one tick consequent equation of the wick here leaving this portion open acts as what Breakaway Gap fueling it to run to buy side what's the context"**

### Algorithmic Influence and Lunchtime Liquidity

*   The speaker discusses algorithmic changes in delivery based on the time of day.
    *   The context is that the algorithm changes its delivery.
    *   Seeks to target traders who have open positions and have made money in the morning.
    *   **"the context is we are in a time of day where the algorithm changes its delivery what is it going to do it's going to move on traders that have open positions that have made money in the morning where's their stops boom if there was no algorithm these things would not happen it wouldn't happen just like I outlined it they wouldn't perform this way they wouldn't be this way they wouldn't March to the the step that I gave it don't listen these people they say there is no algorithm because they're marketing something else that they're trying to make money off of which is nonsense"**
*   Counters the notion that there is no algorithm.
    *   The speaker believes that the people that say there is no algorithm are marketing something else.

### Historical Market Context and Time-Based Analysis

*   The speaker uses the Dollar Index as a point of reference.
    *   Asks to play devil's advocate and consider a situation where the dollar wasn't rallying.
    *   **"now let's just play devil's advocate for a moment and say for a moment that the dollar wasn't rallying at the time okay I'll show you what I mean by that this is this is the dollar right now so we've been seeing all of this so I called this move on the es"**
*   Compares current market moves to those of the **1980s** and **1990s**.
    *   Notes that the move called on the ES would have been considered a significant price move back then.
    *   **"it's not a significant price move but that move was what the move were in the 90s like in the 80s and the 90s that was a move like that was a move that you could be proud of so you wouldn't be happy if you were trading in those low volatility conditions let's go back to es real quick all right so from here to here that was a trade idea that would have been like that's a good day back in the 90s and you know mid 80s and such that is it like that's that's a run that you would have been proud of but you're not in love with those types of moves now because you have seen 40 handle runs 100 handle runs 200 handle runs all in the same trading session sometimes not day session divided by the lunch hour"**
*   Highlights the importance of time and price analysis, rather than solely relying on patterns.
    *   Emphasizes that time is the first important factor.
    *   **"so it's not a matter of looking for a fair value gun or an order block or a breaker you have to understand that there are certain times of the day because I teach time and price the first important factor is time and if you don't know what time it is in relationship to what the algorithms do the relationship between smart money that uses an algorithm to get in sync with the algorithm that is the price engine the the mechanism that causes the markets to run higher or lower for liquidity"**
*   States that markets move based on algorithmic actions and not simply buying/selling pressure.
    *   Emphasizes that it's not the buying and selling pressure.
    *   Price will go to specific levels regardless of how many people are buying or selling.
    *   **"it's not the buying and selling pressure it's going to go to these levels regardless of how many people are buying it or selling it there's lots of people out there always tossing Market orders in there and all you got to do is control where it's going somebody's going to book the price there's always Market orders coming in not everybody's trading with a limit order not everybody's trading with a stop order Market orders are coming in all the time and they only need one contract the book price"**
*   Reiterates that knowing *what*, *why*, *where*, and *when* is critical.
    *   Volume and market orders are discussed.
    *   **"so your idea about volume is flawed you have to know what they're doing why they're doing it where they're taking price and for what reason and when is it expected time when I'm teaching you I'm teaching you how to anticipate certain events by time"**

### Anticipation, Scripted Price Action, and Market Manipulation

*   The speaker teaches students how to anticipate events by time.
    *   Students are confident when being interviewed by funded account companies.
    *   The funded account companies are the most confident.
    *   **"so I'm not worried about missing moves my students are not worried about missing moves why why are they so confident when they're being interviewed by the funded account companies that pay them out that's the common denominator they're all saying my students they're being profitable in those funded account companies are the most confident they don't sound like someone just got lucky that's coming from their own words their own interviews they're talking and saying those things that's not me that's them because they've done the work they've done these things and they have seen the evidence that these things repeat by time first so we can anticipate when the next type of setup is going to form"**
*   Goal is to avoid being surprised by price action by understanding it's scripted nature.
    *   Everything is scripted.
    *   Price action is already predetermined.
    *   **"we are not falling victim to being surprised by Price action we're not ever looking at price and saying oh my goodness where did that come from why did this happen like you you've never heard me say that I'm never going to say that I'm not I'm not I'm not surprised everything that I'm teaching you is scripted everything that you see in price is scripted it's already predetermined"**
*   Critiques reliance on indicators and entry models, emphasizing the importance of recognizing repeating patterns.
    *   The magician's got you over here with the sleight of hand.
    *   The real work's done elsewhere.
    *   **"you're so busy worrying about your indicators and entry models to pay attention to the fact that these things are repeating every single day and every single week and unless you look for them you won't ever identify them it'll never happen you'll never pay attention to it because the magician's got you over here with the sleight of hand you're watching this and when the real work's done in the other they got you looking at indicators they got you arguing about what methods better I don't have a method I'm the market I'm Mr time and price okay I missed their Precision I'm not I'm not a method"**
*   Highlights predictability and predetermined nature of market fluctuations.
    *   Observing and studying these things allows traders to avoid surprise.
    *   **"so when these things are observed and studied you're not surprised when you see things like the buy side liquidity that's been delivered here you're not surprised by the fluctuations to a very specific level in a manner that is predetermined it's predictable that's the thing that most people don't understand that's the power that you're looking for but you can't identify it you don't even know that's available so therefore you don't pursue it and then you come into contact with me and then you're seeing these types of things here and they're not big runs they're not big price runs I understand that but the range in itself hasn't been much at all anyway but here's your buy side liquidity as well here so that one's done and the people that left early thinking they aren't getting anything from it today they have no idea what they're missing"**

### Scheduling Setups and Lunchtime Macro

*   Claims the ability to schedule trade setups.
    *   Gives the example of scheduling it like the TV Guide.
    *   **"you can schedule your trade setups like the TV Guide I know every single day every single trading day that has a full trading session there you go there you go one more time this must be random isn't it must be random ICT must be random stuff just keeps happening all the time can't find that in your books but you can schedule all of this stuff so if you can schedule things like 11.50 to 12 10. there's your lunch macro I didn't just make that up to make this fit today go back and listen to my other teachings listen to my Twitter spaces as much as I hate saying that now a lot of information on those things even though they're laced with a lot of unfortunately bad language sometimes"**
*   Identifies the lunchtime macro between **11:50** and **12:10**.
    *   States that this is when a price run occurs against the daily range.
    *   Price will run to the liquidity that will be used for protection purposes on what was utilized in delivery of the morning session.
    *   **"here is 1150. right there and 11 10. I'm sorry I'm sorry 12 10. right there in between those two times okay there will be a price run that runs the liquidity that that goes against the daily range and what am I saying there I'm stating that the price will run to the liquidity that will be used for protection purposes on what was utilized in delivery of the morning session in layman's terms what has happened in the market since the morning 9 30 drop so shorts have been profitable at 11 50 to 12 10 starts in a macro okay a macro is a short list of directions that the algorithm itself will start operating under I am not form-fitting this this is not cherry-picked I've literally walked you through exactly what you see in your chart right now based on the time it's going to form I didn't create these times because it happens to work today these are the very times that my students and the people that have been learning from me publicly for free these things are in my teachings"**
*   Clarifies that the lunchtime algorithm runs on stops and offers liquidity to the marketplace.
    *   Buy side liquidity was identified earlier.
    *   **"it runs for the liquidity that was used for protection from the morning session that's what the lunch algorithm does it runs on stops it offers liquidity to the marketplace well I told you where the buy side was here and I told you it was over here and we want to see what you want to see animation we want to see the market move with speed and distance if it were to do that we could see it trade up into this area right over here and at 12 10 there's your candle at 12. let me get this out of the way I'm looking at it wrong there you go at 12 12. it delivers it this candle starts it small little drop down leave this portion open as a breakaway Gap run up into that level there"**

### Assessing Trade Viability and Emotional Detachment

*   Poses the question of whether a new student could have taken a specific trade.
    *   The question you need to ask yourself is can you see 10 Handles in that?
    *   Newer students may not be able to take the trade.
    *   **"now the question is here's the question you need to ask yourself can you see 10 Handles in that no so for you as a new developing student could you take that trade no if you've been inversed in the things I'm teaching you've been doing it for a while and you're a little bit more Nimble could you take that trade yes who's going to tell you when you can do that you and your experience and when you're not emotionally attached to the outcome think folks think"**
*   Highlights the need for emotional detachment and experience in determining trade viability.
*   Points out the precise delivery of price to a specific level, reinforcing the concept of algorithmic influence.
    *   Look how price delivered right to this candle's love.
    *   **"if there wasn't an algorithm this stuff couldn't be called beforehand it wouldn't happen like this look how price delivered right to this candle's love what's look right up here okay look up here in the upper left hand corner that value look at the level of that candle right there what is the low 41 45 and a quarter okay 41 45.25 what's the high of the candle here we're going to look at this value right there okay the value of that candle is 41 45 and a quarter you cannot improve on perfection now every single time I come out here with a live session I do these things every single time"**
*   Reflects on the speaker's journey to developing confidence and composure.
    *   Early on, the speaker lacked confidence and had to forge patience.
    *   **"now when I first learned how to do these setups and such I didn't have the confidence I didn't have the the John Wayne composure that I I know I know I know that I know it was uncomfortable waiting for the results to sit through it will it really do it will it really do it and I had to forge patients it didn't happen overnight it's not going to happen overnight for you by watching me do this you get the splash over the bubbly feeling of wow that did pan out and some of you are regretting not having bought it"**
*   Describes the correct mindset for observers: blessed to have been present and gaining insight.
    *   If you feel that you're not ready, that's the right mindset.
    *   **"if you feel that you're not ready if you've watched this you respected the idea that you know what we watched this morning and how we transitioned to the lunch hour and the macro outlined and everything panned out like we were looking for wonderful and you're not emotionally attached to what took place and you're not terribly excited and you're not turned off by anything you just are blessed to have been here and you observed and you picked up more insight that's the right mindset if you are thinking to yourself okay what's the next move you're impulsive you're gonna have to fix that"**

### Avoiding Impulsivity and Focusing on the Process

*   Warns against impulsivity and constantly seeking the next trade.
    *   If you're thinking to yourself okay what's the next move you're impulsive.
    *   Need to fix that.
    *   **"every single time I'm on Twitter or if I do something you know live and I say it and it pans out invariably there are students or viewers they'll say okay what's the next move Sidelines um lunch uh the workout the gym the walk the walk my dogs that you know to take a nap before two o'clock you know there's like there's places to think that's what's next just because the trade closes or the idea comes to fruition doesn't mean okay immediately go into something else let's go in here and do something else now"**
*   Suggests alternative activities to avoid impulsive trading after a successful trade.
*   Explains two reasons people want to take the next trade.
    *   Because they didn't do it on the last one.
    *   Then they regret it.
    *   **"and I think that happens for people for one of two reasons one um they they want to take the next one I say because they didn't do it on the last one and then regret it when you shouldn't be wanting to take the trade that I talk about you should be observing is the things I'm talking about panning out does it pan out because if it doesn't pan out I don't know what I'm talking about if I don't know what I'm talking about if I can't articulate it real time live like this on the smallest time frames lowest latency I can create with this YouTube"**
*   Stresses the importance of observing whether the speaker's analysis pans out.

### Live Communication and Market Transparency

*   Defends the use of live explanations to demonstrate non-cherry-picked market conditions.
    *   Can't call that back.
    *   Whatever is said is already starting to go wherever it's going to go to wherever you are in the world.
    *   **"that's probably not true I think I had that on the middle one it ain't that it ain't the lowest latency it's the setting between the highest one they do normal latency then it's low and lowest there's something to that effect I have it in the middle because the last time I did a live stream um it was tell me how to error and I was afraid it was going to cause problems so I just moved it up there it's not changing any of this like I can't once I talk like I can't I can't call that back whatever I say it's it's already starting to go wherever it's going to go to wherever you are in the world I can't take it away from you know making it to your computer or YouTube servers once it's spoken it's out there and you're gonna get it there's no better way of communicating a non-cherry-picked condition but live explaining it I don't need to push a button in front of you I don't need to do that"**
*   Doesn't need to push a button in front of people.
*   The speaker wants viewers to understand that they don't need to copy them.
    *   If the speaker doesn't know what they're talking about it will be apparent and obvious.
    *   **"the folks that say I do you're not paying attention you just simply want to copy me and I don't want you to do that I don't want you to feel that you have to do that if I don't know what I'm talking about it will be apparent and obvious and it would have been apparent obvious by now but just because we can see these types of moves does it mean that it's probably the best trade for you right now or it's a trade that you should be taking that's that's one of the main takeaways that we can predict price we can do it very precisely like scary Precision price action and again that wouldn't exist if the markets are all moving by supply and demand"**
*   Reiterates that predictable, precise price action wouldn't exist if markets were solely driven by supply and demand.

Okay, here is the meticulously organized and refined version of the provided text, ensuring that every detail, context, and nuance is retained while enhancing readability and structure.

## Market Predictability, Time-Based Analysis, and Algorithmic Influence

### Debunking Randomness: The Role of Time and Algorithms

*   The speaker firmly rejects the idea that market movements are driven by random **buying and selling pressure**.
    *   Argues that it's impossible to attribute market behavior to a "myriad of different trading Styles and applications."
    *   Poses critical questions:
        *   Which trading logic does the market follow on any given day?
        *   What logic determines the highs and lows of specific candles?
        *   Do traditional frameworks like **Wyckoff** or **Supply and Demand** predict these movements with timing accuracy?
    *   Emphasizes that the precise run-up to **4145.25** couldn't be explained by these conventional methods.
    *   **"buying and selling pressure there's no way absolutely no way that you're going to convince me or anyone else that has a brain that random buying and selling pressure based on a myriad of different trading Styles and applications which one is the market following today which logic did it use today to book that high which logic did it use to make that low in that candle right there what framework did it use did Wykoff tell you at a time it was going to do that Supply and demanded same side and tell you the time that this candle right here is going to form and do that very thing and lead to that run up into 4145-25"**
*   Affirms the audience is in the right place for genuine insights.
    *   Stresses the speaker's commitment to their audience's success and passion for sharing knowledge without charging fees.
    *    **"you're in the right place you're in good hands I'm not charging you anything I love doing this I want to see you succeed"**

### Timing the Market: The 11:50 to 12:10 Macro

*   The speaker highlights their willingness to extend the session to capture a specific market event: the **11:50 macro**.
    *   Confirms that students were prepared for the anticipated movement.
    *   Acknowledges that new viewers may not have been aware of the expected action.
    *   **"I've got I've given you more time than I allotted for today because I know if I sat here long enough I would get that 1150 macro and so I said I'll stay here till 12. my students knew exactly where we were going with that but you as a new viewer or a new student you have no idea you had no idea what to expect but these things are predictable"**
*   Outlines a strategy for days when the preferred setup doesn't materialize in the morning.
    *   Reiterates the importance of **time** as a key factor.
    *   If a "Silver Bullet" setup isn't found between 10:00 and 11:00, the speaker advises against impulsive actions or "revenge" trading in other markets.
    *   **"so if we can time a framework that exists in the morning but say it doesn't materialize like I didn't have a silver bullet set up this morning no problem does that mean go out there and just go roll the dice and do something outside of your model no you wait what Michael what are we waiting for what what am I looking for time so if I can't find the setup I'd like to see between 10 o'clock and 11 o'clock if I'm choosing to trade with that Silver Bullet model and it may be formed in a market that I wasn't watching am I going to get revenge on the marketplace for doing it somewhere else and not allowing my Market of Choice to form no I wait what am I waiting for"**
*   Explains the significance of the **11:50 to 12:10** timeframe.
    *   States that a price run will *begin* within this 20-minute window, driven by algorithmic activity.
    *   This "macro" targets liquidity, not randomly but in a predictable manner.
    *   **"11.50 to 12 10. in between that 20 minute window there will be a price run that begins it doesn't mean it completes in that 20 minute period it just means it begins that macro starts running algorithmically and it will run to liquidity and it's not random look at the chart folks look at it look at your chart that's real time yours painted just like mine and I'm not in the room making your candlesticks"**

### Predetermined Market Action and the Role of Intervention

*   Asserts that market action is largely predetermined and time-based.
    *   Claims the market is running on time.
    *   **"everything can be predicted it can be timed the market can be timed the market is running on time everything about the market is time based it's time driven everything about this day and every day is predetermined"**
*   Acknowledges the possibility of manual intervention disrupting the script.
    *   Admits that such interventions can lead to incorrect predictions.
    *   **"there are times when manual intervention comes in and it completely disrupts everything and I will be wrong on that day as long as there's no manual intervention I'm going to be right I say that because I'm the author of these Concepts"**
*   Highlights the inherent risk of unforeseen events.
    *   Mentions the potential for "Black Swan" events and geopolitical instability to impact markets.
    *   **"but that does not mean or invite you to think I want to think like in terms of right or wrong but I know when I'm likely to be ran over by manual intervention most times but I'm still subject to getting railroaded by any old Black Swan event that anybody else would be you know railroaded by too that's the inherent risk everybody has that same risk we don't know if they're going to drop bombs anywhere and cause all kinds of geopolitical things upheavals we don't know you don't know that I don't know that I'm expecting things like that to occur we're going into some really turbulent times but barring those events price is absolutely predictable"**
*   Reiterates the ability to predict price movements under normal circumstances.
    *   Cites the earlier explanation of the problematic low and its impact on reaching a specific objective.
    *   Emphasizes the lack of such insights in conventional trading resources.
    *   **"barring those events price is absolutely predictable I explained to you how that low down here was problematic in reaching to the objective down here you can't you can't find a chapter from books or courses to talk about that you have to have someone that knows how to do it navigate it real time and explain it to you"**

### The Lunch Hour Macro in Action

*   Recaps the outlining of the lunchtime macro and its subsequent execution.
    *   Describes how the price formed a candle, left a specific portion open, and then ran for buy-side liquidity.
    *   Highlights the precise delivery of price to a tick-perfect level on a candle.
    *   **"then we transitioned into the lunch hour and I outlined exactly how that candle here formed leaving that portion down here and how we would run for the buy side here Run for the buy side here and if we got the speed and distance and reach like we saw here it would go up into that very very young right there and that candle is low and it happens just to be the very tick that price forms on that candle right there is that random is it lucky"**
*   States that experienced students view these events with a sense of routine.
    *   Expresses that Students familiar with these patterns are not surprised because they understand underlying principles.
    *   They are not driven by flawed retail indicators.
    *   **"none of my students that had been with me ever see this as luck they're bored by it they're not they're not surprised they're not running around with a grin on their face every time I'm doing a live I mean they might be today because because they know that you're listening and you're new and they know you're you're probably thinking how on Earth could this be because we know what we're doing we know what we're looking for we're not taken by surprise we're not following flawed logic we're not looking at retail indicators the only thing that's on my chart is a reference point that the algorithm itself will refer to in why the market will respond accordingly"**

    *   Market does not operate outside the script.
    *   **"the Market's not going to do something outside the script it's not going to be driven by buying and selling pressure it's not it doesn't work that way it does not work that way folks I don't care who told you otherwise I don't care if you used to be at a trading desk record yourself a market maker that's not how this rolls buddy"**
*   Challenges the conventional view of market makers.
    *   The speaker claims it's impossible to beat the market maker.
    *   A true market maker controls and delivers price.
    *   **"I never seen the market maker come out here and talk where the price is going to go and it delivers it to the tick you're not beating the market maker ever it never happens because you can't control price they do if you're a dealer and you call yourself a market maker you're not a market maker you've mislabeled yourself and they gave you a title that's overreaching a market maker controls and delivers price whether you want to subscribe to the fact that they exist or don't exist explain how I'm this precise because that's who's talking to you"**

# **E-Mini S&P 500 (SMPS) Market Analysis & Weekly Review**

## **Introduction**

This document provides a detailed analysis of the E-Mini S&P 500, based on a review of market data and commentary. The goal is to analyze the price action, identify key levels, and outline potential trading scenarios. All information is presented as is from the original content.

**Video URL**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=441vklRYYR4

## **Weekly Chart Analysis**

### **Current Trading Week Overview**

*   The analysis starts with the current trading week.
*   Price traded above the previous week's high.
*   **Target**: The initial upside target was around 4180. 4180.25 or 4180.75. The specific price was not exactly recalled.
*   This target was based on the midpoint of the wick between the candle's open and high.

### **CPI Commentary & 4180 Level**

*   The analyst shared their opinion on the **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** on Twitter.
*   **4180** was mentioned as a potential upside objective for the week.
*   The manner in which the price traded around 4180 was considered indicative of how the market would behave for the remainder of the week.

### **Price Action & Potential Bearish Scenario**

*   Price action fell one quarter of a point (one tick) short of reaching 4180 today
*   Having run the previous week's high and subsequently given up a significant portion of the gains, there is a possibility of a retracement.
*   The potential retracement could lead the price back down into the high and low of a specific candle.

### **Fair Value Gap & Consequent Encouragement**

*   **Range**: A fair value gap, described as a "buy side imbalance sell side inefficiency," is identified.
*   **Consequent Encouragement Level**: 4085.25.
*   The analyst will monitor if the price drops into this range and potentially closes the gap.
*   Closing the gap entirely would signal a potentially bearish outlook, leading to lower targets.

## **15-Minute Timeframe Analysis**

*   Sell-side liquidity exists below the current price.
*   The extent to which the price interacts with the weekly gap (buy side imbalance sell side inefficiency) will be closely observed.

## **Daily Chart Analysis**

### **Key Levels & Volume Imbalance**

*   The daily chart is presented as "naked," without indicators.
*   The opening price of a particular candle and the previous high of another candle were identified as key levels.
*   A **volume imbalance** is noted, coinciding with the opening price of a specific candle.
*   This imbalance also falls just short of one quarter of a point (one tick).

### **Intraday Reversal & Sell-Side Liquidity**

*   An intraday reversal pattern has emerged.
*   Sell-side liquidity is present below a specific low.
*   An imbalance exists in the market structure.

### **Encroachment on Fair Value Gap**

*   Price action encroached upon a fair value gap.
*   This gap aligns with the imbalance highlighted in the weekly chart.

## **Hourly Chart Analysis**

### **Buy-Side Imbalance Sell-Side Inefficiency**

*   A **buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency** is identified, creating a fair value gap.
*   The price reached down into this gap after an upward movement.

### **Target Levels & CPI Reaction**

*   The analyst initially gave 3 targets, or 4 if including the 4180 level from yesterday.
*   The targets were:
    *   The consequent encouragement of a specific wick.
    *   The buy-side liquidity above a particular high.
    *   The **4180** level (which was just short of being reached after the CPI number).

### **Potential for Sell-Side Liquidity Grab**

*   If the initial analysis of a move higher on the CPI number was incorrect, the price could target sell-side liquidity.
*   A significant amount of sell stops are believed to be resting below the current price.
*   The analyst expects that the market will gravitate towards that sell side liquidity.

### **Near-Term Bearish Outlook**

*   Based on the current positioning, the market appears bearish in the near term.
*   Even if a longer-term bullish trend is in play, a move to take out the sell-side liquidity would be acceptable.
*   If the price were to reject the sell-side liquidity and move animatedly higher, that would indicate a decidedly bullish sentiment.

## **15-Minute Timeframe (Zoomed In)**

### **Fair Value Gap as Bullish Framework**

*   An imbalance and a fair value gap (buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency) are identified.
*   This fair value gap served as the framework for the bullishness on the CPI number.

### **Analyst's Trading Style & Opinion Sharing**

*   The analyst consistently shares their market opinion, even when not actively trading.
*   This practice helps students understand the analyst's perspective and study the market's price delivery in real-time.

### **CPI: A Risky Event**

*   CPI is acknowledged as a risky event, emphasizing the importance of not "standing in front of it."

### **The Takeaway: Tape Reading & Observation**

*   The successful CPI forecast, though not acted upon with a trade, is considered a valuable experience in tape reading and observation.

## **Silver Bullet Trade**

### **Fair Value Gap Utilization**

*   After the run, the Silver Bullet trade is identified, which is the fair value gap.
*   This gap is extended and is utilized in the PM session as well.

### **Sell-Side Liquidity Target**

*   Price reaches for sell-side liquidity below a specific low in the PM session during the last hour of trading.

## **5-Minute Chart Analysis (Zoomed In)**

### **CPI Number & Fair Value Gap Interaction**

*   The CPI number prompted a trade down into a fair value gap.

### **Real-Time Market Analysis**

*   The analyst directs attention to their Twitter feed for real-time market prompts.

### **Missed Targets & Fair Value Gap Rejection**

*   Three targets were nearly hit following the CPI release.
*   Price fell short of the 4180 level.
*   The price broke down completely, running over the buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency.
*   A fair value gap was created between the 10:00 and 11:00 range, also known as the Silver Bullet trade.

### **Silver Bullet Trade: Setup & Execution**

*   **Setup**: The Silver Bullet trade is defined as a fair value gap setup between 10:00 and 11:00.
*   **Execution**: This involves identifying a fair value gap, targeting liquidity, and aiming for a minimum of five handles.
*   **Candle Body Analysis**: While wicks cause the damage, the bodies of the candles tell the story. The market explodes lower, taking out sell-side liquidity and digging into the imbalance mentioned on the hourly timeframe.

## **New York PM Session**

### **Fair Value Gap Extension & Continuation**

*   Beginning at 1:30 PM, the fair value gap that was previously identified is extended in time and used as a trading opportunity.
*   The session between 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM is described as a "sweet spot" for PM session traders.
*   A continuation of the day's trend (either bullish or bearish) is typically observed within this time window.

### **Last Hour of Trading (3:00 PM - 4:00 PM)**

*   At the beginning of the 3:00 PM hour, a high-rated shift in market structure occurs.
*   **Sell-Side Imbalance Buy-Side Inefficiency**: This imbalance is used to identify a potential entry point.
*   **Consequent Encouragement**: The midpoint of the imbalance, or the consequent encouragement, acts as a resistance level.
*   The market aggressively trades lower.
*   **Institutional Order Flow Entry Drill**: The market shows a willingness to break away, the anticipation of an opening imbalance is confirmed, making this a breakaway gap that digs into deeper prices.

### **Swing Projection & Target**

*   Standard deviation is applied to swing projections, measuring from a specific high to a low.
*   **Target**: The analyst aimed for the low target during the last hour of trading.
*   **Negative Three Standard Deviation**: A negative three standard deviation level is identified at 4113.5.
*   This level coincides with the low of the day.
*   **Market on Close Macro**: The analyst notes the extreme precision, with the market trading exactly to 4113.5, further validating the model.

### **End-of-Day Price Action**

*   The market trades back higher, slightly encroaching on the imbalance before falling back down.
*   The low of the day remains intact, and the market enters a range-bound trading pattern.

## **Closing Remarks**

### **Anticipated Market Open & Future Outlook**

*   The analyst expresses a desire to see a gap lower at the six o'clock open, followed by a fill and a continued move lower overnight and into the following day's session.
*   The analyst acknowledges the difference between desired market behavior and actual market behavior.

Here's the organized version of the provided text, formatted for clarity and readability while preserving every detail and nuance.

### **Market Analysis and Commentary - [Date Not Specified]**

#### **Introduction & Technical Difficulties**

*   Video URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxVE8zUIRQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxVE8zUIRQ)
*   Apologies for the initial loud audio; microphone settings in OBS were adjusted.
*   Apologies for the late start; the charting software was slow to load.

#### **Current Market Overview - ES (E-mini S&P 500)**

*   **Fractal in Price:** The market is currently "stuck" in a fractal pattern, presenting both bullish and bearish possibilities.
*   **Breaker:** A breaker was observed this morning, monitored in relation to the pre-8:30 AM PPI (Producer Price Index) number.
*   **Price Target:** 4132 buyside, potentially leading back to an old new week opening gap.
*   **New Week Opening Gap (NWOG):**
    *   **Definition:** Shaded area on the chart representing where trading stopped last Friday and started on Sunday.
    *   **Relevance:** Used as the "magic" behind yesterday's PM session highs. Regular trading hours gap extended forward explained the stopping point.
    *   Due to holiday volume last Friday, a close proximity to the opening Gap is used.
*   **Green Rectangle:** Represents a fair value gap on the 5-minute chart. It originated at 2:50 PM on Monday.
    *   **Considerations:** The initial fair value gap formed at the start of the week.
    *   **Influence:** Like the fair value gap in the opening range (first 30 minutes, 9:30-10:00 AM), this is a crucial reference point. Respect or disrespect of this gap shapes the daily narrative.
    *   **Volume Profile:** "I don't subscribe to volume profile, I think it's just another excuse to get into a trade." The initial fair value Gap that forms in the first 30 minutes is a influential reference point.
    *   Low threshold of five handles.

#### **Chart Annotations & Rationale**

*   Volume Imbalance was being watched but is not of interest anymore after a body was laid down over top of it.
*   Annotations are removed from the chart when no longer useful. It's important to show why elements are present, or removed, from the chart.

#### **Dollar Index (DXY) Analysis**

*   **Current Trend:** Animated to the downside following the 8:30 AM PPI number.
*   **Daily Chart:** Watching for the potential reach into sell-side liquidity. Key question: How will price react upon reaching this level?
*   **Scenario 1: Hammer Through:** If the dollar accelerates downwards, ES could potentially trade higher.
*   **Scenario 2: Rejection:** If the price hits, rejects and trades higher, this will be favorable for the ES. This does not mean that I am forcing the trade.

#### **ES (E-mini S&P 500) Specific Analysis**

*   **Buy Side Liquidity:**
    *   The high has been taken out.
    *   Rally yesterday fell one tick short of the opening price on that candle by 1 tick (41.80).
    *   Potential draw lower to the sell-side below, due to a small imbalance.
*   **Dollar Correlation:** The dollar's actions will determine whether ES follows through or potentially moves higher. If dollar's accelerate's on the downside with the dollar and that provides lifts for ES.
*   **Alternative Scenarios:** Euro/Dollar and Pound/Dollar are higher due to dollar weakness. NASDAQ is showing strength.

#### **NASDAQ Analysis & "Sick Sister" Concept**

*   **NASDAQ Strength:** Much more strength behind NASDAQ compared to ES.
*   **Breaker Identification:** Potential breaker pattern forming (low, high, lower low). The up-close candle is key.
*   **Fair Value Gap:** Watching for price to run through the fair value gap on the upside.
*   **Inversion Fair Value Gap (IFVG):** Look for the fair value gap to be treated as an inversion (support).
*   **Fractal Trap:** The market is currently in a fractal trap, caught between bullish and bearish forces.
*   **Learning Opportunity:** These conditions provide valuable learning experiences for future market participation.
*   **Sick Sister Concept:** Due to the NASDAQ leading on the upside, ES may catch up with the leader.

#### **Dow Jones Industrial Average Analysis**

*   **Lack of Symmetry:** Dow went lower, taking out sell-side liquidity, while NASDAQ moved higher.
*   **Symmetrical Market:** A symmetrical market is when the averages are in agreement, supported by the dollar.
*   **Current Disagreement:** The Dow's performance diverges from NASDAQ and ES, indicating a lack of symmetry.

#### **Trading Strategy & Patience**

*   **Potential ES Target:** ES might run above buy-side liquidity, trading into the new week opening gap high. Consequent encroachment roughly 4138.75.
*   **Consequent Encroachment:** 4138.75 is consequent encroachment between this old new week opening Gap in old new week opening Gap high so respective low and high and midpoint.
*   **Patience is Key:** "I would sit on my hands, do nothing here until we got above this fair value gap."
*   **Reasoning:** Market isn't symmetrical, and all three averages aren't moving in tandem. Wait for confirmation before acting.
*   **Dollar Index Consideration:** Dollar Index is weaker, we would be expecting all three averages to move higher.
*   **Avoid FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out):** Sticking to a defined pattern with rules is crucial.
*   **Learning from Observation:** Even if nothing happens, valuable experience is gained through observation and analysis.

#### **Market Normalcy & Current Conditions**

*   **Daily Rut:** The market needs to break out of its current daily rut on ES, NASDAQ, and Dow.
*   **Risk Aversion:** Concerns about geopolitical tensions and banking issues are contributing to risk aversion.
*   **Parked Money:** A significant amount of money is currently parked, awaiting a catalyst (fear or inspiration) to move.
*   **Scalping Environment:** The current market is predominantly suitable for scalping.
*   **Patience is Paramount:** If scalping doesn't fit your trading model, exercise patience and focus on other activities like studying and backtesting.
*   **Intraday Advantages:** Teaching intraday techniques offers numerous examples and opportunities to refine trading skills, even for swing and position traders.

#### **Community Interaction & Audio Check**

*   A twitter was done for an audio check to the community.

#### **Detailed ES Analysis (Continued)**

*   **Swing Low:** Swing low respecting the Monday fair value gap.
*   **Bullish Breaker:** After trading down into a bullish breaker, looking for a trade-up into consequent encroachment (4138.75 to 4140.50).
*   **Dollar Index Contingency:** Contingent upon continued dollar Index weakness. Watching the 5-minute chart for dollar erosion.
*   **Swing Low Significance:** Single long wick candle to the downside into the bullish breaker. A higher low on the candle shows initial signs of support at the old Monday fair value gap. The Monday fair value gap is initial and extended through the week.
*   "I just had the word this had to turn you guys like to use for volume profile and it escaped me again".
*   **Target Scenario:** Looking for price to trade above the fair value gap and then respect it.
*   **NASDAQ Influence:** NASDAQ's strong upside performance suggests ES may have unfinished business at the 4138 level.
*   **Non-Holiday NWOG Preference:** Use older NWOG, in close proximity, rather than the current weeks due to it being impacted by the holiday schedule.
*   **Inversion Fair Value Gap (IFVG) Criteria:** Need to see price trade above it and at least close it. Start a new candle that trades down into it. Cannot just trade above it and come back down through.

#### **Averages Revisit & Dow's Potential**

*   **Dow Jones Requirement:** The Dow needs to trade above the fair value gap and treat it as support before running for the buy-side.


Here's the meticulously organized and refined version of the provided text, formatted for maximum clarity and readability, while ensuring that EVERY detail, nuance, and original element is preserved.

### **Market Analysis and Commentary (Continued)**

#### **Dollar Index (DXY) - Further Analysis**

*   **Current Status:** The dollar's continued movement lower is not yet confirmed. It remains speculation at this point.
*   **New Setups:** No new trading setups are currently identified.

#### **NASDAQ Analysis**

*   **Buy Side Imbalance:** The NASDAQ exhibits a "buy side imbalance, outside of efficiency."
*   **Swing Low:** A swing low is present.
*   **Stop Placement:** All stops would have been trailed below the swing low.
*   **Potential Drop:** The market *could* drop into this area.
*   **Critical Condition:** Crucially, the market should *not* fully close this imbalance.
*   **Candle High:** The high of the referenced candle is 13,030.50. A full retracement is undesirable for bullish continuation.
*   **Partial Fill Permissible:** A partial retracement is acceptable, without concern.
*   **Short-Term Bullishness Removal:** If the dollar rallies, this bullish scenario is negated.
*   **Dollar Requirement:** The dollar *must* remain weak (consolidation acceptable, rallying is not).
*   **Breaching Low:** Slipping below negates the bullish interest. This would undo the morning's initial outlook.

#### **Overall Market Perspective**

*   **Long-Term ES Target:** This analysis doesn't alter the previously outlined longer-term target for the ES.
*   **Time Horizon:** There's ample time until Friday's close.
*   **Price Action Driven:** The analysis is based on *current* price action.
*   **Flexibility is Key:** Aim is to teach flexibility, allowing traders to evolve beyond initial models.
*   **Initial Model:** The first adopted model is important, but likely not the only one used throughout a trading career.
*   **Model Count:** While some traders may have dozens of models, only *one* is strictly necessary. And you have to start with that one model.

#### **Fair Value Gap & Order Block Observation**

*   **Recent Pass:** The market has made another pass into the fair value gap/older block.
*   **Range Monitoring:** Behavior within the range of the referenced candle's low and high is being observed.
*   **Dollar Index Reading:** The dollar is currently firm at 100.91.
*   **Fair Value Gap on DXY:** A fair value gap exists on the five-minute dollar index chart.
*   **Time Reference:** This fair value gap is visible on the 9:30 candle (five-minute basis).
*   **Opening Range Context:** Analysis is focused on the first 30 minutes (opening range).
*   **Displacement:** Patience is required, waiting for displacement to occur.
*   **Current Status:** No displacement observed *yet*.
*   **Market Firmness:** NASDAQ still looks firm.
*   **Dow's Condition:** Dow looks problematic.
*   **Cable (Pound/Dollar):**
    *   Appears to be trying to consolidate.
    *   Bias: Imbalance "outside efficiency" suggests a potential trade down to 1.2515/1.2514.
    *   Losing that level could open the door for a higher dollar.

#### **Actionable Insights & Speculation**

*   **No Actionable Response:** The current chart provides no clear "actionable response" that would prompt a trader to take on risk.
*   **Speculative Bias:** The commentary remains speculative, suggesting a *potential* move higher towards 4138 and 4138.75.
*   **Confidence Lacking:** Nothing currently reinforces confidence in this direction.

#### **The Importance of Inversion Fair Value Gaps**

*   **8:30 Scenario:** Imagine sitting down at your chart for the first time at 8:30, without any prior knowledge or bias.
*   **Initial Observation:** At 8:30, the market took out the buy-side.
*   **Buy-Side Liquidity:** These highs here have buys-stops residing above them.
*   **Swift Movement:** In a single move, it ran up and traded into an old new week opening gap low.
*   **Lack of Sustained Movement:** It did *not* remain elevated after this move.
*   **Aggressive Rush:** It *was* in a rush to get there.
*   **Subsequent Price Action:**
    *   Has the price reversed? No.
    *   Has it returned to fair value? Yes (discount, bullish breaker).
    *   Multiple passes into Monday's initial Fair Value Gap has occured.
*   **Continued Observation:** This behavior is being closely watched.

#### **Fair Value Gap Deep Dive - Context is Key**

*   **Indicator Caution:** Just because an indicator identifies a separation between candles, it doesn't automatically qualify as a tradable inefficiency or an ICT fair value gap.
*   **Imbalance Awareness:** Yes, there is an imbalance present.
*   **Unique Application:** The unique aspect lies in *how* the fair value gap is utilized within a broader narrative.
*   **Concept Origins:** The speaker asserts inventing this application of the concept.
*   **Personal Application:** How the presenter incorporates imbalances in their analysis and tape reading is the unique differentiator.
*   **Body Respect:** Observe how the bodies of the candles are respecting the fair value gap.
*   **Integration:** Combine this observation with the rapid move above for buy-side liquidity.
*   **Premium Array Target:** The market targeted a premium array (the old new week opening gap low).
*   **Return to Breaker:** The market then traded back down into a bullish breaker.
*   **Uptrend Confirmation Needed:** Animation to the upside and aggressive movement to new highs *after* hitting the breaker has not yet been observed.
*   **Fair Value Gap Impediment:** The fair value gap is currently acting as a barrier.
*   **Criteria for Action:**
    *   Price must trade *above* the fair value gap.
    *   A new candle must *then* trade back *down* to it.
    *   This is the *minimum* requirement.
*   **Patience is Essential:** Otherwise, remain still and do nothing.
*   **No Regret:** This approach eliminates any sense of missing out.
*   **Avoid Chasing:** Avoid chasing price movements.
*   **Anticipation, Not Reaction:** The goal is to anticipate what the price *should* do within the expected narrative, rather than react to it.
*    **Waiting For the Setup** Waiting for a setup that fits the criteria you already know.
*   **Trader Superpower:** Patience, discipline, and waiting for the right setup are a superpower for a trader.

#### **Trader as Superhero: Self-Control and Patience**

*   **Neophyte Desire:** New traders often seek invincibility.
*   **Inherent Weakness:** Even Superman has Kryptonite.
*   **Essential Superpower:** Self-control, patience, and an understanding of how to react to price action are key.
*   **Guaranteed Response:** Everytime it dropped down like that, some traders would see a short position, but not the narrator.
*   **Disjointed Market:** The market is "stuck" because it's disjointed (not symmetrical).
*   **Averages Disagreement:** All three averages aren't moving in tandem.

#### **Specific Price Action Demands**

*   **Fair Value Gap Break:** The market needs to run *above* the fair value gap.
*   **Timing:** This run should occur on the *current* candle *or* the very next one.
*   **Breaker Revisit:** A revisit to the bullish breaker (the up-close candle at the highest up close) would erode confidence.
*   **Missing Response:** The breaker hasn't delivered the expected price response.
*   **Premium Array Target:** The market only went back up to a premium array, trading down to the fair value gap and showing the same price response.
*   **Demand for Delivery:** "I demand [the] price to deliver that specific way, or I'm going to supply myself a reason to sit still."
*   **Avoiding Weakness:** The aim is to avoid situations where hidden weaknesses might be present in the price action (Kryptonite).
*   **Risk Mitigation:** Tread lightly and avoid rushing in.

#### **Accuracy Through Mindset**

*   **Reason for Accuracy:** Accuracy stems from working within a specific mindset and skillset.
*   **Long Discussions:** These are the topics of the long discussions.
*   **Not Just About Entries:** More meaningful than entries and signals.
*   **Navigation Skills:** How to navigate, sit still, and know what to wait for are crucial skills.
*   **Evolving Questions:** The goal is to evolve beyond simple "buy/sell" questions to more meaningful inquiries.
*   **Key Questions:**
    *   How do you know when *not* to take a trade?
    *   When is a fair value gap *not* useful?
    *   When will a breaker *fail*?
*   **Preservation of Capital:** This is how you make *and* keep money.

#### **Demand for Price Action**

*   **Current Status:** It has yet to get above the fair value gap.
*   **Demand:** The setup needs to close above the fair value gap.

#### **One-Minute Chart Analysis**

*   **Chart Scale Reduction:** Dropping down to a one-minute chart to further analyze because we've passed above the fair value gap.
*   **Risk Consideration:** The market may "tear off without us."
*   **Ideal Scenario:**
    *   See the candle close.
    *   New candle opens and trades down to the fair value gap.
    *   Price finds support there.
    *   Then look for expansion higher towards 4138.75 - 4140.50.
*   **Process & Protocol:** This outlines the process and protocol for utilizing the inversion fair value gap.
*   **Alternate Uses:** This is *not* the only way it can be used.
*   **Entry Level Expectation:** How to utilize it as an entry level expectation.

#### **Low Resistance Liquidity Runs**

*   **Aggressive Scenarios:** If all three averages (NASDAQ, Dow, ES) were moving higher in agreement, and the fair value gap had attention, the approach would be more aggressive.
*   **Alternate Entry:** Going along *inside* the fair value gap, *not* requiring it to go above it and trade back down.
*   **Implementation Disconnect:** Others teaching the concept are not able to fully teach it because they don't fully understand it.
*   **Immediate Rebalance:** Look for an immediate rebalance which would be like coming down to the top of this candle or just short of it and then running higher.
*   **Definition** Immediate rebalance is my concept that doesn't require three candles to make what you would expect as a fair value gap.

*    **Individual Stock Support**If all these factors coincide, you have the ideal conditions for a low resistance liquidity run.
*   **Patience and Understanding** Develop the patience and understanding that separates you from the average participant.
*   **Avoiding Decoupling**: Trade conditions that lack decoupling, where stock index futures (Dow, NASDAQ, E-mini S&P) move in tandem in the same direction, with the dollar index moving in the opposite direction, supported by forex and individual stocks.
*   **Ideal Conditions** A low resistance liquidity run with almost immediate feedback that you're right.
*   **Focus on the Right Conditions**
   Professional traders should focus on knowing what to wait for, rather than over-trading and dulling their edge.
*   **Professional's Approach** This makes you patient.
*   **Specific Expected Action** Because you know what you are expecting, you're patient and won't be caught in the frenzy.
*   **Market Agility** In low resistance liquidity run, the market just quickly easily, just without any effort at all and fast, it just takes off and goes right to where you want to go.

*   **Return to One-Minute Chart:** Returning to the one-minute chart will help jog the speaker's memory.

#### **Time Distortion Recap**

*   **Time Distortion within Candles:** All candles within the choppy range represent time distortion.
*   **Reference Point:** Returning to the five-minute chart provides the originating frame of mind and focus.
*   **Expected Discount:** The fair value gap dropped into a discount as expected, interacting with a bullish breaker (a discount array).

#### **Bullish Breaker Identification**

*   **Discount Array:** The fair value gap acted as a discount array.
*   **Range Identification:** The low of the 7:10 candle defines how far price could drop.
*   **Breaker Qualification:**
    *   The body of the current candle must be higher than the body of the compared candle.
    *   While the compared candle has a higher high, candle volume dictates that it would be closing here.
    *   Wicks perform damage, while bodies dictate the story.

#### **Order Block Considerations**

*   **Order Block Mentorship:** Identifying and using order blocks requires experience and mentorship.
*   **Order Block Specificity:** Not every down-closed candle is an order block.
*   **Fair Value Gap Specificity:** Not every fair value gap is tradable.

*   **Power Three Concepts:** Opening price at midnight can be used for Power Three concepts.

#### **Midnight Opening Price Filter**

*   **Midnight Filter:** Buying below the midnight opening when bullish and selling above it when bearish.

*   **Initial Opening Range Resistance:** The initial opening range was providing resistance, aligning ES with the NASDAQ.
*   **Dollar's Influence (If/Then Logic):**
    *   *IF* the dollar weakens (goes lower), *THEN* ES can easily rise.
    *   *HOWEVER,* if the dollar consolidates (as predicted), then the outcome differs.
*   **Dollar Consolidation:** The dollar is consolidating within a range (high and low).
*   **Consolidation Impact:** A consolidating dollar is not the same as a declining dollar, which would typically support higher ES prices.
*   **ES Long Positions:** The speaker would not want to go long on ES if the dollar was strongly rising and breaking out of its range.

#### **Critique of Indicators**

*   **Indicator Companies:** Mentions companies creating indicators for platforms like TradingView.

#### **Example of Incorrect Fair Value Gap Usage**

*   **Rejection of Turning Point:** Speaker states earlier that he does *not* expect a turn at the mentioned point.
*   **Potential Outcome (Incorrect):** An indicator would label the area as bearish, suitable to short and expect lower prices.
*   **Three Stages Completed:** The dollar has already completed three stages of runs on the sell side.
*   **Three Drives Pattern:** A narrative stance stating it's already taken three pools of liquidity for sell side.

#### **Dollar Narrative: Consolidation vs. Upside**

*   **Likely Dollar Scenarios:** Consolidation or a run for buy-side liquidity.
*   **Consolidation Areas:** If consolidating, the dollar would consolidate within specific areas (mentioned previously).
*   **Buy-Side Target:** If running higher, the buy-side target is right above the current level.
*   **Teaching Limitations:** Such nuanced understanding is hard to convey in a tweet or in hindsight.

#### **Hindsight Bias**

*   **Cherry-Picking Accusations:** Explaining events in hindsight can seem cherry-picked or form-fitted.
*   **Insight Provided in Advance:** The speaker emphasizes that this insight was provided beforehand.

#### **Dollar Consolidation and Cross-Pair Dynamics (Forex)**

*   **Dollar Consolidation Effect:** Dollar consolidation allows non-dollar-based currency pairs (cross pairs) to move more freely.
*   **Contrasting Example:** When the dollar is moving freely, it creates directionality for pairs like EUR/USD and GBP/USD.
*   **Euro-Pound (EUR/GBP) Example:** During dollar consolidation, EUR/GBP can trade wider than normal.
*   **Cable (GBP/USD) and Euro Disparity:** Highlights the difference in animation between Cable (a bit weaker) and Euro.

#### **Example Visualization**

*   **Euro Dollar (EUR/USD):** Consolidating alongside the dollar.
*   **Pound Dollar (GBP/USD - "Cable"):** More animated and trending downwards.
*   **Euro Pound (EUR/GBP) Revelation:** The trend materializes in EUR/GBP as it's not directly dollar-based.

#### **Cross-Pair Trending Opportunities**

*   **Trend Identification:** Trends will emerge in crosses that are not dollar-based.
*   **Core Content Teaching:** The speaker asserts this is taught in their core content ("ITT 101").
*   **Preparedness and Confidence:** This knowledge helps traders anticipate moves, eliminating surprises.

#### **Black Swan Events**

*   **Unexpected Events:** Surprises should be limited to "Black Swan" events (unforeseen geopolitical or catastrophic events).
*   **Example Events:** September 11th or Pearl Harbor-like events.
*   **Loss Acceptance:** Losses are inevitable in the face of such unpredictable events.
*   **Risk Management:** Focus is on minimizing damage ("bleeding").

#### **ES Market Return**

*   **Back to Context:** Focus returns to the ES market.

#### **Time Distortion Recap in ES**

*   **Time Distortion:** All the candles bouncing around within a tight range represent time distortion.
*   **Time-Based Charts:** Time-based charts best reveal algorithmic price delivery.
*   **Alternative Chart Critique:** Renko bars and other chart types obscure the underlying dynamics.

#### **Algorithmic Understanding**

*   **Clarity Preference:** Sticking to time-based charts offers the clearest view of algorithmic behavior.
*   **Alternative Chart Outcomes:** Using other chart types will prevent truly understanding the "why" and "when" of price movement.

#### **Monetized Information**

*   **Valuable Information:** The speaker reiterates the value of the information they're sharing.
*   **Dealing Range Focus:** The focus is on understanding price action within that dealing range.
*   **Waiting Patiently:** It is important to not be impatient and wait for the correct opportunity inside the dealing range.

#### **Expectation and Targets**

*   **Bullish Support:** Earlier analysis supports price going higher at the breaker.
*   **Range Respect:** Price doesn't break outside the dealing range.
*   **Waiting for Movement:** Focus on waiting for movement above the fair value gap within the range.
*   **Premium Positioning:** This gap is in the premium (upper) portion of the range.
*   **Higher Price Expectation:** The speaker expects higher prices, outlined earlier.
*   **Target Specificity:** The speaker is aiming for a specific target (4138.75) to take price above a previous high, which is where by side liquidity rests.

*   **Respectful Critique of Coders:** Addressing coders who are trying to automate the speaker's teachings, acknowledging their efforts but pointing out the inaccuracies and incompleteness of their implementations.

#### **Narrative Over Technicals**

*   **Premium Disregard:** Emphasis that previously the algorithm was telegraphing that this market was not interested in respecting premium levels.
*   **Narrative vs. Technical Analysis:** Emphasizing that narrative understanding is more important than technical analysis.
*   **Balanced Price Range Awareness:** Pointing out that specific areas are actually balanced price ranges, not fair value gaps.
*   **Silver Bullet and IFVG Differentiation:** Describing the difference between a traditional fair value gap-based Silver Bullet trade and one based on an immediate rebalance.

#### **Discount Pricing and Market Structure**

*   **Discount Pricing Motivation:** Suggesting that the market went down to pick up "discount pricing."
*   **Premium Array Reaction:** Observing price reacting as expected after moving above a premium array.
*   **Rejection of Short Bias:** Explaining why the speaker was not looking for shorting opportunities.

*   **Market Timing Assertions:** Challenging the notion that it's impossible to time the market.
*   **Logic-Based Approach:** Emphasizing that the speaker's approach is based on sound logic and accessible to listeners.

#### **Addressing Doubters and the Power of Live Streams**

Here's the meticulously organized and refined version of the provided text, formatted for maximum clarity and readability, while ensuring that EVERY detail, nuance, and original element is preserved.

### **Addressing Listener Interactions and Market Commentary**

#### **Time Constraints and Communication**

*   The speaker indicates limited availability for individual assistance ("I don't have that time to do that").
*   Encourages listeners to utilize live sessions for learning ("this is your time to listen to me").
*   Acknowledges Twitter messages will be seen but doesn't guarantee immediate response.
*   Expresses difficulty recalling a specific point due to not focusing on a chart or timeframe.
*   Promises to share any remembered insights via Twitter.

#### **The Apex of Learning: Explaining Market Dynamics**

*   Posits that explaining *why* price action occurs (or doesn't) is the "highest form of learning."
*   Example: Questioning why price wouldn't take out stops at a specific level due to bullish NASDAQ signals.

#### **Market Decoupling and Analysis**

*   Notes instances where markets were "decoupled" (Dow declining while NASDAQ rose).
*   Emphasis on using multiple markets for analysis, even those not directly traded.
*   Speaker doesn't trade the Dow but uses it for analysis; same for the Dollar Index in Forex analysis.
*   Sideways movement in the dollar can signal opportunities in non-dollar crosses.
*   Dollar movement can restrict freedom in non-dollar based crosses, a "control mechanism."
*   Trading is more than just finding a setup; it's assessing what positions are being held.
*   Reiterates that this approach is not taught through standard indicator-based methods.

#### **Manual Charting and Logical Reasoning**

*   Advocates for drawing fair value gaps by hand, criticizing laziness in avoiding manual annotation.
*   Manual annotation forces thought behind chart markings, enhancing understanding.
*   Highlighting the benefits of knowing the logic behind analysis, seen directly on the chart.
*   Framing references within a specific 60-minute timeframe.
*   Reminding listeners of their initial motivations for entering trading and contrasting that with current knowledge.

#### **Precise Market Timing and Superior Analysis**

*   Asserts the ability to time the market within a 10:00-11:00 timeframe daily.
*   Acknowledges the initial questions and uncertainties faced by new traders (where to buy, when the next move will happen).
*   Claims to remove excuses for lack of discipline, organization, and clear understanding.
*   Declares this approach as "the elite Superior Apex version of analysis," unparalleled in its effectiveness.

#### **Critique of Indicators and Hindsight**

*   Indicators are seen as applying math to past events, lacking predictive power.
*   Dismisses volume analysis as being based on hindsight.
*   The speaker claims to predict where low volume nodes will be before volume profiles plot them.
*   Belief-based systems are ascribed to price, but price is indifferent to them.

#### **Real-Time Accuracy and Transparency**

*   Comparing systems to flipping a quarter, where data can be manipulated to support any desired outcome.
*   Emphasis on calling out market movements live with no "safety net" or room for error.
*   Challenging viewers to identify flaws or deception in the speaker's live analysis.
*   Reasons provided to encourage trust in the process, emphasizing it's free and effective.
*   If he was selling the product, the audience would demand the same transparency.
*   Doing live streams while others don't, questioning why viewers still doubt.
*   Doubts originate internally, not from the speaker's concepts or the market itself.

#### **Responsibility and Market Consistency**

*   Success is attributed to the individual trader's actions, not the speaker's.
*   Traders must own both successes and failures.
*   The speaker presents the logic of repeating market patterns.
*   Listeners are encouraged to develop their own unique models based on these patterns.
*   Listeners should note down a new concept in their book.
*   Suggests filtering and supercharging the methodology to improve it.

#### **Adapting to Market Conditions**

*   Acknowledges current market conditions as challenging, leading to lower-grade price delivery.
*   Differentiates from trend-based analysis, focusing instead on the market's ability to move freely.
*   Market movement being held back, controlled within the daily range.
*   Until leaving the consolidation range, the market is in a scalping environment.
*   Swinging trades or long-term positions within this range are likely to result in frustration.

#### **Understanding Market Profile and Avoiding Frustration**

*   Understanding market profile is crucial, referring to a "roadmap" of how price should behave.
*   Current profile is range-bound consolidation.
*   Preference for upward movement, but acknowledges potential for shorting opportunities.
*   Nimbleness is required; avoid "marrying" trades into long-term positions.
*   Holding trades for weekly or monthly objectives only to see them reverse is deflating.
*   Mistakes are inevitable but learning from them is critical.

#### **Learning from Experience and Trusting the Process**

*   Encourages listeners to avoid pitfalls by listening to the speaker's advice.
*   The best students will avoid mistakes and trust the process.
*   Submitting time to the process leads to being in the upper echelon of the speaker's student base.
*   Many students want to repeat the speaker's past mistakes ("a badge of honor"), which isn't recommended.
*   The speaker is presenting the best things to do to avoid mistakes.
*   Goal is to shorten the learning curve.

#### **Narrative and Algorithmic Understanding**

*   Answering the narrative equation involves knowing what the algorithm will do next and *why*.
*   No need for price to drop below relative equal lows when there's underlying bullishness.
*   Ignoring individual candles until reaching a breaker level.
*   If the breaker low is broken, assess whether it's a stop run that rejects or accelerates downwards.
*   Treating the breaker as an inversion level would negate the initial bullishness idea.

#### **Anticipation vs. Reaction**

*   This approach emphasizes anticipating price action, not reacting to it.
*   Showing what negates a trade idea and what price would likely do instead.
*   Knowing what you want to trade on and identifying when that scenario is invalidated.
*   Not about being "always right," but favoring one side of the market.
*   Always telling listeners the favored side of the market, even during unfavorable conditions.

#### **Limitations and Honesty**

*   Speaker acknowledges limitations and is honest about them (e.g., not always right during CPI).
*   Past experiences (losing money) inform current strategies (avoiding CPI trading).
*   If CPI setups are there, it gives insights into trading the later part of the day.
*   CPI trading is not recommended for developing students.
*   CPI moves too fast, with no forgiveness for errors.

#### **Value of Live Streams and Knowledge Sharing**

*   Promised and delivered two live streams that week.
*   Live streams remove emotion and focus on the speaker's taught logic.
*   The information being used has already been taught on the channel.
*   Spending time watching live is key to learning and seeing the logic in action.
*   Enables traders to time the market and avoid common beginner mistakes.
*   Addresses concerns about identifying trade setups and trading specific sessions/instruments.


Here's the meticulously organized and refined version of the provided text, formatted for maximum clarity and readability, while ensuring that EVERY detail, nuance, and original element is preserved.

### **Timeframe Specific Trading and ICT Mentorship**

#### **Addressing Timeframe and Instrument Queries**

*   Common questions from listeners revolve around specific timeframes and instruments:
    *   "What do I trade in the afternoon session?"
    *   "What do I trade during the lunch hour?"
    *   "What do I trade during the London close timeframe?"
    *   "What pair do I trade at that timeframe?"

#### **The Power of the 60-Minute Window (10:00-11:00 NY Time)**

*   The speaker emphasizes that an entire trading model can be built within a single 60-minute window: **10:00 AM to 11:00 AM New York local time.**
*   Acknowledges that some listeners may feel they will outgrow this or already anticipate doing so, leading them to dismiss it.

#### **Combatting Information Overload and Shiny Object Syndrome**

*   Many listeners are distracted by:
    *   Chasing "whoever else is hot on the Internet."
    *   Anticipating what else ICT will teach later in the year.
*   This leads to neglecting the core, effective strategies already available.

#### **Recommended Starting Point for New Viewers**

*   For new viewers asking "Which video should I watch?", the speaker recommends:
    *   The live streams from the **2022 mentorship**.
    *   These 40 videos provide immediate actionable insights.
*   This approach avoids overwhelming new viewers with thousands of hours of content.

#### **Becoming a "Savage": Mastering the Core Content**

*   The speaker promises that mastering the core content will make viewers a "Savage" trader.
*   However, this requires first engaging with live streams to understand *why* the market behaves as it does.

#### **The Value of Live Streams: Testimony and Transparency**

*   Live streams are presented as "testimony" to the effectiveness of the speaker's methods.
*   They offer transparency:
    *   No hidden monitors or cherry-picked data.
    *   Analysis is presented *live*, before the market movement occurs.
*   Mature students should be able to identify fair value gaps and stop-loss placements without needing constant hand-holding.

#### **Mentoring Defined: Predicting, Not Reacting**

*   True mentoring is *not* about discussing past trades.
*   It's about:
    *   Outlining what the market *should* do *live*.
    *   Explaining *why* it should behave a certain way.
    *   Teaching listeners to predict market movements independently.

#### **Critique of Traditional Education**

*   The speaker criticizes educators who:
    *   Don't show their trade executions or histories.
    *   Don't demonstrate stop placement or profit-taking.
*   The speaker's approach emphasizes "where the rubber meets the road" with real-time examples.

#### **Achieving "Elite Status" Through Self-Sufficiency**

*   The goal is to empower listeners to become self-sufficient, achieving "Elite status".
*   This involves:
    *   Not needing to buy more books or follow other strategies.
    *   Knowing how to "supercharge" the provided information.

#### **Recalling a Key Concept**

*   The speaker momentarily loses his train of thought, seeking to recall a key concept.

#### **Supercharging Strategies: Combining Timeframe, Profiles, and Tendencies**

*   **If you trade on the days that in a weekly profile meaning where for instance a classic bullish weekly profile would be a Tuesday low of the week in London:**
    *   The "supercharging" idea involves combining:
        *   The 10:00-11:00 AM time window.
        *   A market with a seasonal tendency (e.g., ES tending to trade higher).
        *   A favorable weekly profile (e.g., Tuesday low of the week).
    *   This approach aligns with larger timeframe price runs.
*   For example, if the ES tends to trade higher for the next couple of weeks, prioritize looking for longs.
*   If trading on Monday/Tuesday, and the low hasn't formed by Wednesday's New York session, the potential for a big move is high.
*   The goal is to place everything in your favor in that direction.

#### **Integrating "One-Shot, One-Kill" Trades**

*   This approach doesn't replace "one-shot, one-kill" trades.
*   It provides an alternative entry opportunity if the earlier trades (e.g., in London) were missed.
*   Instead of dwelling on missed opportunities, wait for the 10:00-11:00 AM "Super Bowl".

#### **Guarantee and Emphasis on Personal Responsibility**

*   The speaker guarantees the existence of these setups in the future.
*   However, he cautions against blindly expecting them every day, emphasizing the need for skill and adaptation.
*   Ultimately, success depends on the individual trader's correct execution.

#### **Addressing Personal Mistakes and the Illusion of "Luck"**

*   The speaker acknowledges his own past mistakes and "scar tissue" from forcing trades.
*   He warns against attributing success to luck, emphasizing the importance of logic and skill.
*   Luck is "happenstance" - doing something without real logic, that the price wanted to do.

#### **Respect for Profitable Traders, Regardless of Strategy**

*   The speaker acknowledges that anyone who is profitable and consistently profitable is an exceptional money manager and deserves every bit of that Accolade, regardless of their trading strategy.

#### **The Primacy of Risk Management**

*   Many traders may be good at seeing setups, but fail due to poor risk management.
*   They risk too much on a single trade, negating their accurate analysis.
*   **Knowing how to keep your money is the first rule** and more important than technical analysis.
*   Many ignore this, focusing solely on the potential for profit.

#### **Patience and Learning: The Keys to Success**

*   The speaker observes his own son falling into the trap of trying to "prove" himself, rather than learning patiently.
*   He advises against doing things your own way when you don't know what you're doing.
*   Profitable traders are not necessarily keyed up about needing to trade every day.

#### **Avoiding Burnout and Creating a Positive Learning Environment**

*   Impatience and constant trading can lead to:
    *   Blowing accounts.
    *   Frustration.
    *   Burnout.
*   The speaker aims to create a learning environment that, while not always "fun," provides a clear understanding of *why* the market behaves as it does.

#### **The Core Questions of Every Trade**

*   Every trade requires answering the following questions:
    *   Where is the price going?
    *   How can you time when it's going to start going there?
    *   Where are you wrong, so you can limit risk?

#### **The Real-Time Challenge and Margin for Error**

*   The speaker emphasizes the challenge of providing these answers *live*, in real-time, with a thin margin for error.

#### **Addressing Skepticism and Misinterpretation**

*   Some students, despite witnessing the speaker's live analysis for years, claim it's flawed because *they* can't replicate it.
*   The speaker emphasizes that everyone makes mistakes, including himself.

#### **Personal Weaknesses and Avoiding "Kryptonite"**

*   The speaker reveals his aversion to trading the Yen (JPY) due to past negative experiences.
*   He avoids it to prevent triggering old anxieties and maintain a clear mindset.
*   Rather than trying to "fortify" himself against this weakness, he acknowledges his limits.
*   He is avoiding his kryptonite because past painful experiences with the Yen could cause his brain to relapse and constantly feel like he is going to end up in that situation again.

#### **The Uniqueness of the Yen**

*   He considers the Yen currency to be extremely and aggressively manipulated.

#### **Supercharging: Higher Timeframe Analysis and Larger Range Swings**

*   (In layman's terms) To "supercharge," use higher timeframe analysis and expect larger range on a short term basis.
*   By incorporating a higher timeframe element, traders can participate in bigger price runs instead of taking all profits at a small target.
*   This involves taking a portion off at the initial target and leaving one contract as a "runner."

#### **Analyzing a Chart and Identifying Imbalances**

*   The speaker addresses a specific orange level on a NASDAQ chart.
*   He initially doesn't recall its significance and has to investigate.
*   It turns out to be a previous imbalance marked on a five-minute chart.

#### **Trading Example: Relative Equal Highs**

*   Illustrates a trading scenario:
    *   Consolidation breaks upward.
    *   Initial target: relative equal highs (buy-side liquidity).
    *   Alternative Target: The strongest relative equal highs.
    *   Lower timeframe traders might target the same levels using imbalances on 5, 10, or 15-second charts.
*   The speaker cautions against always assuming the weakest one will be the best to trade.


Here's the meticulously organized and refined version of the provided text, formatted for maximum clarity and readability, while ensuring that EVERY detail, nuance, and original element is preserved.

### **Trading Insights and Mentorship Guidance**

#### **Analyzing a Trade Setup**

*   The speaker describes a trade setup where the "WAS" (presumably an instrument, but not explicitly named) was not performing as strongly as the NASDAQ.
*   Technically, this made sense because:
    *   There was a bullish breaker.
    *   The speaker was watching a PDA (Potential Distribution Area) expecting it to fail.
    *   The speaker anticipated price failing to send price lower on this Fair Value Gap.
*   The speaker wanted to see price "give way" and open for a trade down to it on a specific candle.
*   The trade rallied "very bad," but then the "silver bullet" occurred.

#### **Concluding Remarks and Encouragement**

*   The speaker expresses hope that the session was helpful and insightful.
*   He acknowledges that mastering the concepts requires effort, but encourages listeners to persist.
*   He recommends engaging with:
    *   His content on Twitter.
    *   His YouTube lessons.
*   He emphasizes that learning takes time and isn't a "five-minute trainer" process.

#### **The Importance of Live Observation**

*   The speaker stresses the importance of seeing strategies executed *live*, not just in market replays or tutorials.
*   Live observation allows viewers to:
    *   See *why* the market behaves as it does.
    *   Understand the reasoning behind decisions.
*   Watching candles "paint" with the speaker fosters a learning experience, regardless of whether the trade is ultimately successful or not.
*   This experience helps develop a sense of how the market "feels" and what to expect.

#### **Trading as a Parallel to Everyday Life: The Car Analogy**

*   The speaker uses the analogy of starting a car to illustrate the expected outcome in trading.
    *   Just as you expect your car to start when you turn the key, experienced traders expect their setups to work.
    *   They aren't surprised or overly excited when it happens; it's simply the expected result.
*   The speaker extends the car analogy to when things *don't* go as planned.
    *   Just as a car might not start, a trade might not work out.
    *   This requires dealing with the issue (e.g., battery, starter, mechanic) and accepting missed opportunities and potential losses.

#### **Desensitization and Learning from Mistakes**

*   The speaker emphasizes the importance of *desensitization* by watching price action without constantly trading.
*   He notes that new traders often become bored without constant action.
*   The speaker advises:
    *   Accepting that mistakes and losses will happen.
    *   Learning from mistakes without monetary loss in the beginning.
    *   Giving yourself permission to make mistakes as part of the learning process.

#### **The Pitfalls of Hindsight and Cherry-Picking**

*   The speaker cautions against the illusion of perfection in hindsight.
*   He explains that showing a "perfect" trade setup in a review video, after the fact, is misleading.
*   Lessons need to be seen with real-time data to be truly effective.
*   Live sessions and Twitter commentary offer insights into *where* the market is going and *where* to focus.

#### **Developing a Trading Profile and Model**

*   Over time, consistent exposure to specific concepts allows traders to:
    *   Trust in those concepts.
    *   Back-test them in old data.
    *   See how often they form.
*   This process leads to the development of an initial trading profile, which then becomes a major part of a trading model.
*   The model is refined over time to achieve consistency.

#### **Risk Management: The Flat Tire Analogy**

*   The speaker stresses the importance of impeccable risk management.
*   He compares a losing trade with proper risk management to a flat tire: a nuisance, but not catastrophic.
*   He contrasts this with "Johnny Quest" style over-leveraging, which can be detrimental.

#### **The Dangers of Over-Leveraging and Demo Trading**

*   Over-leveraging can lead to fear of taking trades.
*   The speaker explains why some traders excel in demo/paper trading but fail with real money: they are managing risk effectively in the demo environment but not in live trading.
*   The speaker advises:
    *   Trading with the smallest size (micro contracts), even in demo.
    *   Focusing on consistency and making "bread" rather than getting rich quickly.
    *   Conditioning yourself to trade like that from the start.

#### **The Importance of Realistic Expectations in Demo Trading**

*   He warns against using demo accounts to simulate unrealistic scenarios (e.g., trading hundreds of contracts).
*   The goal of demo trading is to condition oneself to trade properly, not to create a "video game" experience.
*   He contrast video game excitement and the stress of real trading.

#### **The Six-Month Rule for Demo Trading**

*   The speaker recommends trading consistently in paper/demo accounts *without real money* for at least six months.
*   He explains the rationale:
    *   Luck can occur in the first three months.
    *   Bad habits can develop in the first three months and surface in the next three.
*   He cautions against rushing into funded accounts or trading with real money before being ready.
*   He advises listening to yourself and recognizing the signs of being unprepared (e.g., being "antsy" and overly excited about the next trade).

#### **The Goal: Boredom and Consistency**

*   The ultimate goal is to reach a point where trading becomes almost *boring*.
*   You can consistently identify setups (70% of the time) and execute them without emotional excitement.

#### **Paper Trading and Demo Trading: Dialing in on the Analysis**

*   Paper trading and demo trading are valuable because they allow you to:
    *   Focus on analysis without the fear of financial loss.
    *   Dial in on the analysis and that's the problem when you start trading with real real money you start worrying about what happens if they ask me what my trading results are today what happens if the broker is watching me what happens if I blow my account what happens if I fail my challenge what happens if my dad sees that I have to pay for another account.

#### **Controlling Internal Factors and Slowing Down**

*   Worry about external factors - but all these things are within your control. You're rushing the process - you need not rush it.
*   Treat this like a business believe me businesses do not, they don't run like a Chuck E cheese, where every trade has a chance to be a kid no you don't want that if you let your child run out there in in the yard with no parameter like no fence and you're near a street are you going to feel safe about your child being out there? Where's your stop loss? the fence.

#### **The Trap of Funded Account Challenges**

*   Most of you only go out there Trading in trying to do these funded accounts trying to pass it in three days five days. You can do a minimum of five days and you gotta have to pass it and you think that's that's what you have to do. Who said that?
*   That's why these companies are getting rich off of you because they know that the parameters they've placed on that funded account challenge is so above the average new Trader that they're going to constantly get those restarting fees and that's what they're banking on.
*   Slow down - slow down.

#### **Patience and Professionalism**

*   If you rush - you will regret it.
*   Professionally minded traders:
    *   Aren't gambling.
    *   Looking for statistical, historically measurable repeats.

#### **Trading is a Transferable Life Skill**

*   Once you know what you're doing, it's like riding a bike.
*   Transferable skill - you can teach your kids, friends.
*   The speaker want to empower their students that they may not have gotten the opportunity to get in their current work.

#### **Financial Freedom and Career Independence**

*   Always be working towards divorcing them as your employer.
*   They have a ceiling on how much you're going to make and when you can vacation and spend time with your family.
*   The speaker emphasizes the long term goals and the importance of a concrete goal.

#### **Concluding Remarks**

*   The speaker shared what he wanted to share today and that's going to be it.
*   The speaker is not live streaming this week - he will let you know when they will be live next week on Twitter.
*   For those who follow him on Twitter enjoy the rest of your day and those that only watch his YouTube videos - enjoy the weekend.

# NASDAQ Analysis and Intraday Swing Model Breakdown

This document details a NASDAQ trading strategy employed with my son, focusing on intraday swing models and specific technical analysis techniques. The session involved identifying key levels, imbalances, and using ICT (Inner Circle Trader) concepts.

## Initial Market Assessment

*   **Date/Time:** Not specified.
*   **Overall Bias:** Initially, the draw on liquidity favored lower prices. A five-handle run was observed and shared on Twitter. This was later updated to reflect a 20 handle prediction for NASDAQ.

## Intraday Swing Model Overview

*   **Trading Above Equal Highs:** Price traded above relative equal highs, creating a gap.
*   **Buy-Side Imbalance:** This entire area represents a buy-side imbalance, leading to a potential inefficiency.
*   **Target:** Expectation that price would trade into the identified low range.
*   **Risk Management:** Emphasized need for a nimble approach with a tight trading range.

## Timeframe Analysis and Key Observations

### 15-Minute Timeframe

*   **Relative Equal Highs:** Price traded above these highs on the Monday.
*   **New Week Opening Gap:** Price hugged the current new week opening gap (high and low).

### 5-Minute Timeframe

*   **Gap Separation:** A separation after trading up into the new week opening gap was evident.
*   **Model 2022:** A rally back up into this level was identified as "Model 2022".
*   **Return to Gap:** A return to the "very bad Gap" was observed.

### ICT Silver Bullet Model

*   **Application:** Used my son Cameron's ICT Silver Bullet model.
*   **Timeframe:** Between the 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM EST hour (specific to ICT Silver Bullet).
*   **Objective:** Looking for a fair value gap to trade into.
*   **News Catalyst:** High-impact news at 10:00 AM EST.

## Trade Execution Details

### Short Entry Based on Order Block

*   **Order Block:** An order block was identified and used for trade execution.
*   **Rationale:** While inside the order block, a short position was initiated.
*   **Time:** 10:00 AM EST, coinciding with the news event.
*   **Initial Profit:** A small profit was taken to demonstrate a scalp trade to my son.
*   **Scale:** Five points on NQ is considered equivalent to twenty points.

### The "Six Sister" Approach

*   **Methodology:** Utilized the "six sister" approach.
*   **Context:** Mentioned in recent Twitter spaces.
*   **Explanation:** More detailed lessons on this methodology will be provided on the YouTube channel.
*   **Synchronization:** Used to align with the already transpiring moves in ES (E-mini S&P 500).
*   **ES Prediction:** ES was indicating lower prices.

## Deeper Dive: Lower Timeframe Analysis

### 15-Minute and Hourly Timeframes

*   **15-Minute Invisibility:** Nothing of significant interest was observable on the 15-minute timeframe.
*   **Hourly Imbalance:** A small gap was identified on the hourly chart below a south-side liquidity pool.

### Rationale for Short Trade

*   **Imbalance Identification:** The gap represented the first imbalance below the south-side liquidity pool.
*   **Target Level:** Anticipated a drop to the identified gap level.
*   **Equilibrium:** Using a low-to-high equilibrium, the target was below the equilibrium level.
*   **Risk/Reward:** This setup was considered sufficient for the intended trade.

### 1-Minute Timeframe Execution

*   **Entry Confirmation:** The execution occurred within the five-minute order block.
*   **Specific Entry:** Entry at 13,281.5.
*   **Cover/Take Profit:** Covered as price ran through the identified low.
*   **Equivalence:** This short-term scalp equated to a five-handle run on ES for my son (Teaching him ES vs NQ difference).
*   **ES/NQ Conversion:** The relationship is 5 ES handles equals 20 NQ handles.

## Additional Trade and Closing Thoughts

*   **Missed Opportunity:** Saw another gap but was concerned about a potential spike higher to fill it.
*   **Entry Compromise:** The entry was not ideal but acceptable.
*   **Breakaway Gap Theory:** Treated the area as a breakaway gap, expecting a possible spike higher.
*   **Unbalanced Price Action:** Price went up to, and then traded down, into the hourly imbalance.
*   **Target Fulfillment:** The high of the imbalance area served as the limit order target for the five contracts.
*   **Final Result:** Approximately 80 handles on NASDAQ today (equivalent to 40 handles on ES).
*   **Sign-Off:** Encouragement to be safe in the next trading session.

# **E-Mini S&P 500 (ES) June 2023 Contract: Daily Market Analysis**

**Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F509lJRrYIM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F509lJRrYIM)

## **Introduction: Setting the Stage**

Good evening, everyone.  In this analysis, we'll be examining the daily chart of the E-mini S&P 500 (**ES**) June delivery contract month for 2023.  I'll be covering the market activity observed today on the **ES**. Before diving in, let me address some common feedback.

## **Addressing Common Feedback and Emphasizing Detail**

When I share these lectures, I often receive comments. Most are positive – full of enthusiasm. However, a few individuals (perhaps four or five) typically suggest that I "talk too much" and should "get to the point." It's important to understand that these markets are highly **technical**. Especially for my students, it's crucial to recognize the **subtleties** that are easily missed upon initial review.

The second or third time you go through my studies or lectures is when it begins to resonate with you more deeply because now you have more experience and those things are now much more impactful in your understanding and your ability to read price action. My goal is to encourage you to delve into the details and become comfortable with the specific information I'm sharing. I'm not just talking to hear my own voice. I'm conveying information that is **paramount** for understanding the precise algorithmic principles that govern these markets and the repeating phenomena that occur across time and price. Keep this in mind, watch carefully, and take notes.

## **Seasonal Tendencies: "Sell in May and Go Away"**

On the daily chart, as mentioned in tweets and short video clips, and as my long-term students know, I closely follow **seasonal tendencies** from a **macro perspective** (daily and weekly timeframes). There are particular times of the year when I favor specific setups.

Specifically, in **May** and the first two weeks of **June**, I lean towards **shorts in stock index futures**. This has evolved into the well-known saying, "Sell in May and go away." It reflects the usual (though not always consistent) tendency for stock prices to decline in the spring leading into June.

I've observed the markets for three decades and there are certain **seasonal tendencies** that are just really, really strong, and one of them is this may influence going into June. If you're looking to pinpoint a specific time of year to trade or anticipate particular price action, being bearish in Spring and then long in the fall months (going into the end of the year, first week of February) is a great place to start.

This tendency isn't just a recent observation. You can find me discussing it in my core content lessons on YouTube. I first spoke about it in **2016**, and the same patterns have repeated every year since then.

*   **2016:** Content released to paid members.
*   **2017:** Repeated in the marketplace.
*   **2018:** Repeated.
*   **2019:** Repeated.
*   **2020:** Repeated.
*   **2021:** Repeated.
*   **2022:** Repeated.
*   **2023:** Expected to repeat (currently).

Don't limit yourself to recent years. Research older data to see that these seasonal tendencies act as a higher timeframe roadmap for significant price movements. *However*, they are **not** a panacea. The futures market isn't guaranteed to behave based on past performance (hence the risk disclaimer). But if you see a strong tendency repeating over *many* years (not just a few), it warrants further investigation and study during that specific time of year. I'm confident you'll find a "gold mine" in this, but you need to add some technical analysis.

## **Non-Farm Payroll Week and Price Action Analysis**

It's important to remember that this is **non-farm payroll week**. At the time of this recording, tomorrow is Non-Farm Payroll Friday, May 5th, 2023. The markets have already started trading for that day, even though locally it's not yet the 5th.

Look at how the high was traded above, creating a **swing high** (a candle with a high with a lower high to the left of it and a lower high to the right of it). Following this, the expectation is for price to drop. Price goes below this **swing low** (a low that has a higher load to the left and a higher low to the right) into this **inefficiency** here (a buy side of balance outside of efficiency, a classification for a specific fair value gap). The market trades down into that, creates a swing low, then rallies back up, swinging above the first swing high. So above this swing high is by side, below this swing low sell side.

We've had a high, low, higher high, lower low. In classical price pattern formation (which I'm not a price pattern trader in this sense), this would be considered a **broadening pattern** or a **megaphone pattern**. While that's a nice explanation in hindsight, I want to know what it's going to do *before* it forms. That's what I teach my students, and what I'm trying to teach you on a higher level, not just basic retail patterns.

I'm not suggesting anyone who studies or uses those patterns can't make money. You can make money flipping a quarter if your risk management is on point. Any catalyst that causes you to make a decision – even something seemingly unrelated like the last time your elbow hurt, it rained, now your knee hurts, which means the S&P is going up or down – can work *if* you have sound money management. You might not make a lot of money, but you could eke out some profit.

In terms of looking at Price action, I want you to look at how the market gravitates towards **liquidity** and **inefficiencies**. If it doesn't do either, it goes sideways and consolidates until the criteria that allows for it to do those previous two things which is go up for buy stops or go up to an inefficiency is met. An inefficiency is like this case, where between two candles, there is one candle there the difference between this candle is high and a difference between this candle is low is the pass-through of this one candle what direction did it go up so what does it mean what does it need to do to make this inefficiency efficient it needs to offer price going down.

Adding detail to the chart:

*   There's an imbalance here.
*   The market goes just above this candle's high. This candle's high comes in at 4061.25.
*   The low of today (my day, Thursday; but Friday in some areas) comes in at 4062.25.
*   It's just one handle shy of meeting that candle's high.

This was one of the factors when I mentioned that we were 50/50 around the noon lunch hour (more on lower timeframes later). This catalyzed my tweet, where I said because we've taken this particular target, I'm taking three contracts off the six remaining I had. I recorded and showed this on Twitter.

This ended up being the low of the day, and the market rallied back up into a short-term intraday premium. If you're new or not versed in what I'm teaching, this may sound like mumbo jumbo.

This level is highlighted in teal. Be aware that it's anchored to **March 30th** on the daily chart.

If you want to pull it up on TradingView, the symbol for the June contract is **ESM2023**.

**TradingView Symbol:** ESM2023

When this contract expires (around the third week of June), this symbol will change to **ESU2023** (U stands for the September contract month). When September expires, U becomes Z (the December contract month).

So, contract months expire, but currently we are in the June contract, and "M" is the delivery month code for June. The final month in the calendar rotation is H, which is for March.

There are only four delivery contracts for index futures: **March, June, September, and December.** The respective symbols are **H, M, U, and Z**.

Now, with that out of the way...

If we were up here at a premium (above this) or high and discount or sell side will reside below here what PD array beside the sell side will we couple it with the by side of balance cell sign efficiency or the sphere value Gap. Let's move to a 60-minute chart.

## **60-Minute Chart Analysis: ICT New Day Opening Gap**

On the hourly chart, you can see how on Tuesday and Wednesday, the market repriced up to this city straight up into it here in between the imbalance that's formed here the market traded up and aggressively broke lower here and then we had this new day startup here overnight now when it says Wednesday that's my local time but all of this is part of Thursday's trading right here's midnight to 1am so this is all part of technically the trading date is seen on trading view so this separation between where we closed right before the 5 PM would shut off for one hour and then it resumes at 6 pm the difference between the opening price at 6 pm and the closing price at five o'clock Eastern time in the US or basically New York local time so in trading view I say this all the time but I want to make sure I'm being complete all the time because I don't know if this is the first video you've ever watched and it frustrates many of you because you're you want to get to the point but the point is I'm educating and you're not the only student I have so I want to make sure I'm providing the details that help people that may be following me just for the first time that have all their coordinates you know in the right place so that way you can follow along as well and it saves on me answering a lot of questions that keep popping up that's mine at least that's my attempt to try to Stave off most of that but I'm not 100 successful in that obviously but anyway this area here we're going to talk about that that's the ICT new day opening Gap these bold lines in here that is my new week opening Gap so this is where the separation between Friday's close and Sunday's opening price we extend that in the future now right away when I talk about that everybody says well you know you didn't invent a gap ICT no and I didn't say I invented the gap I am pioneering the idea of using these gaps through an extended period of time casting forward into future price actions because just because we fill the gap doesn't mean we're done with it that's What Separates Me from everybody else if that Gap forms it's meaningful it's salient that means the algorithm will refer back to that same area again and it will do so for weeks and months at a time now while you're learning and you're learning how to do this for the first time I've canceled everyone through Twitter and Twitter spaces where I first introduced it in February of this year so 2023 new week opening Gap was coined publicly but it's been mine since the 90s but you want to know that that origin was taught originally from me in February in Twitter spaces so there really isn't a video per se now a lot of my students have come up with things real quick to throw on YouTube and you know try to share their understanding or interpretation and they're just introduction they're just like introductory to the idea there's a lot of things that I can do with these things and you'll learn to do as well but for now the basics is simply this try to have at least five of the most recent new week opening gaps it's important for you to have in your Journal every time you have a new Sunday opening of a new trading week on your Sunday journal entry always record what the opening price is and what the previous Friday closing prices that way you always have the information you can have it ready at your fingertips every single time you need it in the future that way if something happens in your chart say you you know I've done this before say you deleted things on your template okay so you can see up here I have new week opening Gap actual okay don't worry about the actual I I will teach those things in the future but sometimes I'll delete a template thinking I have something transferred or transposed on another template and I delete them and I have to go back through my notes and pull up all that information you don't want to be searching through candles like this looking okay is this a Sunday is this a Friday you don't want to do that so it's real simple to write down in your journal every Sunday the markets that you're trading what was their previous Friday's close and yes this works on Forex yes it works on just about every ass I can't vouch for crypto I don't trade crypto so my students do they swear by it but I don't have any opinion or input in that regard but every other asset it works okay synthetic indices please don't ask me about them I don't know anything about it I'm going to touch them and I don't even know what it is so there you go but the the running tally of what your previous Friday's closing prices and your Sunday's opening price that means the very first tick on Sunday at 6 PM when the markets come alive again boom when it happens it's real simple check your charts on a one minute chart what was the opening price write it down Journal it it's done you have it now in the olden days when I first started in 1990s I had a three-ring binder and I would just have a a graph paper and I just wrote down every single Sunday opening price in Friday's closing price and I would have the opening range of the first 30 minutes and the first 60 Minutes.

This area on the chart represents the **ICT New Day Opening Gap**. The bold lines mark my **New Week Opening Gap**, representing the separation between Friday's close and Sunday's opening price, extended into the future.

**Important Note:** *I didn't invent the concept of gaps*. I am pioneering the use of these gaps over extended periods, casting them forward into future price action. Filling the gap doesn't mean we're done with it. That's what sets me apart. If a gap forms, it's meaningful and salient, meaning the algorithm will refer back to that area again for weeks and months.

While you're learning, try to keep track of at least the five most recent New Week Opening Gaps. Record the Sunday opening price and the previous Friday closing price in your journal every week. This provides readily available information.

I first introduced **New Week Opening Gaps** in February of this year (2023) via **Twitter Spaces**. The term was coined publicly then, but it's been my approach since the 90s. There isn't a single video dedicated to it, but many of my students have created introductory explanations on YouTube.

By journaling all of this, you will be able to refer back to previous weeks and entries if needed.

**Journaling:**

*   Record Friday's closing price and Sunday's opening price for your traded markets every Sunday. The Sunday opening price is the very first tick at 6 PM when the markets reopen.

This approach works on Forex and almost every asset. My students swear by it for crypto, but I don't trade crypto myself. And do not ask me about synthetic indices, as I know nothing about it.

In the old days (1990s), I used a three-ring binder with graph paper to record the Sunday opening price, Friday's closing price, the opening range of the first 30 minutes, and the first 60 minutes.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, adhering to all the stated requirements:

## **Trading Plan Nuances and Non-Farm Payroll Week Analysis**

### **Avoiding the "Kitchen Sink" Approach**

At midnight, I analyze all the markets I trade. This concept, while originally taught in the core content for day trading, can be applied across multiple timeframes and sessions, including the Asian, New York, London, and PM sessions for stock indices. I will be teaching many concepts this year, but it's a mistake to try to incorporate *everything* into your trading plan. Don't assume you need to apply everything I've ever discussed to the current price action. That's not how a model works. It's a "kitchen sink" approach, and it will lead to **analysis paralysis**.

Trying to apply too much information can create conflicting ideas, leading to frustration. It's better to limit your focus to one or two specific things within a bias. I'll teach you how to take a simple approach and apply it with a specific template in mind for a trading day. Remember, nothing I teach is a be-all, end-all. It's just one component of a model or trading approach, and useless on its own, unless you have other factors guiding you.

### **Times to Avoid Trading**

There are specific times of the year, days of the week, and weeks of months when you *shouldn't* be trading.

*   New traders should avoid trading on **Thursday** and **Friday** of **Non-Farm Payroll Week**.
*   This is because it's difficult to navigate without the necessary skill set.

This isn't condescending; it's based on experience. It takes a lot of understanding about what price is likely to do ahead of the employment numbers released at 8:30 AM on the first Friday of most months.

Mark that day off as a day to avoid trading. It's likely to be very difficult and become a gamble after the non-farm payroll numbers are released. If you want to take action after the numbers come out, that's your decision, but you shouldn't be trying to trade *during* the non-farm payroll event, as it can lead to erratic price movements and losses.

### **March 5th New Week Opening Gap**

I have here March 5th new week opening Gap. This will help those who have already seen the video where I was trading with this information today, which has been shared on my Twitter feed.

### **Lower Timeframe Analysis: 15-Minute Chart and Bearish Order Block**

We have that blue shaded area, which is that fair value you got below an old daily low. The market digs into that today here. We're going to drop right into a **15-minute chart** and start adding more detail here.

I mentioned on Twitter today that there's a **bearish order block** here.

### **Four-Hour Chart Context and Imbalances**

Now, looking at the **four-hour chart**:

*   See that swing low and cell size below that.
*   We got real close to the bottom of that old imbalance (a buy side of balance, sell side inefficiency, or fair value gap).

I'm going to scrunch it out real quick so you can see where it's at.

You can't see the Fairway Gap here but on the daily chart, that's where it was on the four hour you're gonna see this imbalance this is the reason why we went to the four hour Because once I get into a lower lower time frames you won't know where these other lines are anchored to so this high on March 29th that candle's high on the four hour and this candle is low here on the 29th at 6 pm those are the two separating candles that make up the range between this candle here so in other words you see how this candle had a up down and this candle up down candle up down and up down there's no way there's no imbalance here there's no fair value until we get to this candle here so I'm well not trying to re-teach survey Gap hopefully you can see this is how you should have your charts by the way.

**Important Note:** A lot of people do this, they zoom in and they're watching price like this, whether it be a one minute chart, three minute chart, five minute chart, 15 minute chart. They had it all spread out like this okay you want to have some, you want to have some chart real estate on your screens, you see how it's easy to see that Fairbank app you want to scrunch these up until it's real easy to see the separation oh there's a gap right there so that's what I'm highlighting and if it were to get below that daily imbalance remember we shaded that blue area if you don't know what I'm talking about watch the first couple minutes of the video when I start showing the lipstick on the chart this would be the next discount array if we were to trade down through it that was the draw 40 52.50 okay so the basis was it could reach down here but I'm being cognizant of this range here that was the daily chart Fair Value Guide and you'll see me use that mindset with what I'm going to show you now in the lower lower time frames.

### **Five-Minute Chart Analysis: Order Block and Volume Imbalance**

Okay, so here is that order block at 4099 0.50 and it's anchored on Thursday May 4th at six o'clock in the morning 6 15. we have Fairway Gap here and a order block which is the last two up close candles here it hits that trades down comes right back up rebalances at a volume and balance which is the difference between this candle's body and this candle's body there's a separation there it's not a technical Gap in the definition by anybody else but that separation is what I refer to as a volume and balance I saw an individual make a remark to me on Twitter a few days ago saying that you know he didn't agree with what I was talking about said this is not order flow and I know that what you call order flow and whatever you refer to as order flow maybe you think of it as you know contract volume Market profile maybe you're using the the v-wop in uh pointing control and all those things to me if those things help you that's wonderful but you're looking at things from a retail mindset I'm not looking at things from a retail mindset I'm looking at things algorithmically these things are going to reprice to these areas because they're coded to do that the Market's going to go right into this little area this little separation right there let me let me magnify that okay and I want you to see.

**Volume Imbalance**

So there's the volume imbalance see that candle's body at close and then next candle open right here there's no Wick the open is the high so that's separation right there that is a volume imbalance that means that the algorithm has not offered it has not offered price to the marketplace efficiently between these two price points so it's kind of like a micro fair value Gap that little area right there okay and there you go micro fare value go there's going to be all kinds of people writing books on Amazon trying to get my information in print before my books come out where my books will be completely in intact with the logic everybody else will be talking about something that's going to be useless to them but here you go we have this thing here I'll let me uh do the business where you do extend to the right it's here so now when we drop back out you can see how in that volume and balance the market reprice is right there boom.

*   This area represents a **volume imbalance**.
*   It's the separation between the closing price of one candle and the opening price of the next (where there's no wick).
*   It's like a micro fair value gap.

Now how that works everybody that is impulsive everyone that is new to Trading they don't generally use stop orders either for protection or for entry and they very rarely use limit orders too so what's the type of order they usually gravitate to most when they're trading buy it at the market sell it at the market and admittedly I like to do this live sometimes I'll just go right in there and press the short at the market or buy at the market and I'm doing that to kind of get as close as I can to what you as a neophyte someone new that's never done the things I'm teaching never implemented it before or maybe we've never even had a an engagement with price action I use the market entry to get myself as close as I can to what you as a developing student would do if you were just starting out so that way it gives me the opportunity to have what you might encounter where it's not as precise whereas if I used a limit order and how would I use an Eliminator say if I wanted to sell short okay and I'm taking a deal Liberty here because if it's the first time you ever watched me it's going to seem perfect because it's hindsight right I'm pointing out the things that were obvious grant me the latitude to be able to do that here okay because I promise you're going to see executions in the minor portions of this video I promise you I push the button today I promise you that it's really recorded okay I'll even show you the whole history okay but the point is this I want you to understand that if you grow in your understanding of what is I'm teaching and we're going to teach order entry and all that type of stuff too and the difference between Market orders and limit orders and stop orders I'll give you executions of that as well this year okay so I'll give you the logic what we do how we're using it to get into the market or get out of the market or include more entries for pyramiding like you watched me do on Twitter today and you'll see executions of that but if you wanted to use this entry here to get in sync with the bearish order flow the algorithm will price right back up between these two candles because it's inefficiently delivered there's a gap there so the algorithm is designed to offer to the marketplace efficiency in terms of both a constant Continuum of buy side and sell side in layman's terms every price is offered at least two times that means on the pass down going down and as the market goes lower okay once it passes through a particular price range or a particular price level once it passes down going down like it does here it doesn't offer a body so what the algorithm does it sees that separation between these two time intervals and the algorithm is constantly cycling from a higher time frame down to the lower time frame and it's doing in such a fine level of detail it's looking for these little pockets okay and it's doing it so fast in terms of calculations it's constantly going through a script that's seeking these things and what happens is the market because there's participants always coming out wanting to do what Market orders so when the Market's trading up here at one time this candle was just about to be in that little shaded area but hadn't been there yet so this was all bold bullish candle Green in my case here but it hadn't got into that little shaded Orange area yet and then someone comes out and says I want to buy or I want to sell at the market and the algorithm simply jams the price that's it being available to the marketplace to that order that it knows that there's a constant flow of what Market orders Market orders Market orders oh there's not that many marketers sure it is as soon as an area of buy stops get hit those buy stops come to Market orders to buy at the market whenever there's a pool of liquidity that has by limit orders those limit orders get triggered and they become what by at the market just limiting how much they will be willing to pay on the limit basis but they immediately become at the market see it's what you have learned and how you've learned it that has skewed your perspective and you think because you're using these retail ideas about order flow and you're looking at level two and you're looking at the depth of market and ladders honestly look I'm a familiar I'm familiar with all that stuff I've been around for a long time I understand all that okay I'm not trying to disparage against it I've done it in the past but I don't believe that's an advantage that's not it's not advantageous to anyone if you believe it is there's nothing wrong with that but trying to go around with a sharp stick and say you don't know you're talking about that's not order flow you don't know what real order flow is because the depth of market and level two data that can be spoofed these things aren't going to be spoofed the algorithm is absolutely going to go there and offer efficiency so that's why you're seeing that and that little movement just above it that's because that price on that closing price they get that price perfectly it has to go one tick above so what's the closing price on that candle I have highlighted right here what's the closing price that's this one right here okay it's 4101 and a quarter so that means it needs to go to what price 4101.50 what's the high of that candle right there 4101.50 hello sounds like Daddy wrote something yeah so anyway you have this order block okay it also trades up into that but it goes through the order block how far can it go through order block ICT well it's going to go right in that inefficiency right there.

The algorithm is designed to offer efficiency to the marketplace. It seeks to provide a constant continuum of buy side and sell side. In layman's terms, every price is offered at least two times. Once price passes through a particular range going down, it doesn't offer a body. The algorithm sees the separation between these time intervals and constantly cycles from a higher timeframe down to a lower timeframe, looking for these little pockets.

Because participants are always using market orders, the algorithm will jam the price to make it available to the marketplace. When buy stops get hit, they become market orders to buy at the market. Limit orders, when triggered, also become market orders.

**Understanding Order Flow**

Level two and depth of market data can be spoofed. The algorithm is absolutely going to go there and offer efficiency. That little movement just above it happens because the price has to go one tick above the closing price of the candle.

*   Closing price of the highlighted candle: 4101.25
*   High of that candle: 4101.50

Anyway you have this order block okay it also trades up into that but it goes through the order block how far can it go through order block ICT well it's going to go right in that inefficiency right there.

Now that time of day right here the market trades up into 8 30 A.M the news that comes out at that time today was what employment data it was completely random right the market rallies up there and goes in that little section of price action and then consolidates right in here and then starts to do what take a dive now I want you to think about the logic if the market was willing to go up in this order block and get traded up into an area that I teach this is a volume imbalance okay it's not in books it's mine I authored it okay I codified it it's here you're talking to the author or listening to the author and say it that way I want you to think about how you could use that information right there also I want you to think about how that shaded area here that pink area that's premium this green area here is discount if we were to go over and scrum back over to the left side I promise we'll come back to that area this is where Wednesday's closing price right before 5 PM the last traded price here on the five minute chart we're noting that level right there and then it opened at six o'clock right down here so the difference between that is what I call the new day opening Gap now when this forms people that look for gaps because I didn't invent a gap the theory around my Gap Theory okay the idea of implementing the information that you can be using in your trading is not limited to okay we have a gap here and soon as price goes right to there that's it everybody else is done with it the gap's failed we're done that's not me I'm not retail we don't.

### **Order Block, Volume Imbalance and ICT's Volume Imbalance**

At 8:30 AM, the market trades up into that order block and into that area that I teach. This is a volume imbalance. It's not in books, I authored it. If the market was willing to go up into this order block and get traded up into an area that I teach, this is a volume imbalance so think about the logic on how to utilize this. The pink area is premium and the green is discount. The closing price right before 5 PM on Wednesday, we're noting that level right there.

Then it opened at six o'clock right down here so the difference between that is what I call the new day opening Gap now when this forms people that look for gaps because I didn't invent a gap the theory around my Gap Theory okay the idea of implementing the information that you can be using in your trading is not limited to okay we have a gap here and soon as price goes right to there that's it everybody else is done with it the gap's failed we're done that's not me I'm not retail we don't.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, adhering to all the stated requirements:

### **Understanding Retail vs. Institutional Logic**

I teach you how large institutions and fund managers view the marketplace so that way you can see how the algorithm cannibalizes them. This helps you avoid being surprised by market movements, eliminating that feeling of "wow, where did that come from?". I teach you how retail Traders are going to view the marketplace so that way you're not surprised you're not taken by surprise where the market does something.

That's why I'm very facetious all the time in my Twitter feed, and I'm being sarcastic a lot. Sometimes it doesn't come across because of a language barrier between you and I. You may be from another country, and you may not be able to pick up on the level of sarcasm I have. Many of my tweets are trying to be dry humor, and I may not. It's kind of like Dad jokes a lot for Traders, but the idea is these things form and repeat.

### **March 5th New Week Opening Gap Analysis**

Now, there's also this March 5th. You see I'm trying to move as you can see it March 5th new week opening Gap and March 5th new week opening Gap below. So, the high for that particular week is here, and the low of that where it starts on Sunday of that week on that **5th of March**, and the previous Friday. So, I think it would be like what March 3rd March 3rd and March 5th. So, the Friday and Sunday respectively, the date is March 5th for the Sunday.

*   That level's highlighted here.
*   That's why I have this template called **new week opening Gap**.
*   I'm showing you how to have these levels in your chart.

But I want you to look real real close without me saying anything, what do you see? You notice anything? The **new day opening Gap** here gets filled right there by everybody else's expectations, but is it really? No, it's not. This is simply just repricing back to that level there.

So, between this closing price here and this candle's opening price, there has been really no trading except for these little wicks, this here and this here. Now, below the candle it's usually called a tail, and above the candle it's usually called a wick. Sometimes I'll interchangeably use both calling it both a wick but technically that's what you're going to see it as a candle's tail and a candle's Wick. There's a separation right there that has no trading at all.

Wicks I treat those as gaps as well. So, in my mind, because the algorithm sees these Wicks here the same way we as humans see that gap between this candle's low neck candles high.

**Algorithm's Perspective on Gaps and Wicks**

So what does it need to do? It needs to pass through two times. What does that mean? Where this candle opens Watch What Happens the market trades up through that price point here in order to think of that shaded area we trade from the low of it all the way up to the high of it then it consolidates and does what it treats it as support rallies away wonderful are we done with that guy I'm not you might be the guy that wrote a book that talks about gaps or the people you watch on YouTube or someone else in a Discord or someone else on a telegram Channel or somebody else is taking my stuff and think they understand it they say okay the app's done we're done with it now let's look for something else I'm not thinking that what is it lacking South Side delivery what does that mean well we've had buy side here which is price movement up this is order flow it's one half of the price delivery Continuum that these algorithm theories are based on you can't just simply call this a gap closure and we're done with it that's that's myopic the algorithm has to do what with this still author sell side so buy side was offered that means from from low to high price went up now we have to see a pass through on the downside this is real order flow the market trades from the high end of it down to the low end of it wow interesting it also finds support at that old March 5th new week opening Gap low well isn't that interesting what does the market do then it rallies back up into that volume imbalance the market is bearish why do we know that and how do we know that well ICT said the focus on 40 68.75 and individuals on Twitter were saying no way is it going to go there okay it went there but the point is this when I'm talking to you on Twitter or if I go through the motions of outlining something I'm interested in which is what I've been doing I'm counseling you to submit to my experience so that way you can watch price the right way that way I'm lending you my 30 years of experience in being able to see this stuff before it happens the concepts are mine I codified them I authored them you can't use them correctly without me guiding you so I'm pointing to specific things in Twitter or when I do live streams and when the market gets a little bit cleaner I'll be back to live streaming but right now Twitter's enough the market trades up in that volume and balance consolidates hits the order block remember the 15-minute time frame and then drops rallies one more time and fails then strong rejection lower so what was going on here at 8 30 right there when it rallied from here up to here that was that Employment Number that came out employment claims at 8 30. look at your economic calendar okay it trades up into some random High Not So Random when you're spending time with good old ICT that volume and balance right there so I was watching that and I want to see this price hold at that level and then reject and then have difficulty at the order block that was at 15 minutes I talked about this on Twitter this morning inside this area [Music] near the high of the old Gap that everybody else would have forgotten about which was the opening at 6 pm most people really don't trade that Gap they like the Gap that's formed in the morning with the which is what they call the overnight Gap it's not really overnight cap it's the opening range Gap and I have lectures coming that will teach a lot about that but for now I want you to see how I navigated this week how I looked at this particular day made over a hundred and some handles total for the week and you can see right now if I right click on this go to settings I have to say this because invariably I get this as well if I'm supposed to be this rock star in trading and I made all these Concepts and I've done this and I've you know saved the world in in the world hunger and all these things the people out like the embellish and add to what I've only claimed that these are my Concepts and I authored them and no one's going to teach them better than me and you're not going to find anybody that can do it as good as me because they're mine that's not bragging I do that because I get so many questions by email and so many questions through trading view or questions by you know Twitter they'll ask me what do you think about this guy that's teaching your content or what do you think about this guy that's doing this with your content listen I understand there's a lot of people that are interested in it now my opinion is if you want to learn it you come here I'm doing it for free and you're going to get to get it right from the source there are a lot of people that I've trained lots of them and they use my name to draw a crowd I've given them the permission to do that but you as the student have to exercise due diligence in demand that they can do what they claim they can do because if they're going to just talk about something that's already happened in hindsight which many of you probably feel that's what's going on right here and I promise I'm going to dispel all that right now you have to understand that there's a lot of people that can take this language that I've given out to the public and it can sound smart in hindsight they can explain it away after it's happened but it's altogether something different sitting in front of a live audience quarter million strong half a million strong and call it with no safety net I don't need to have a live account to show you this stuff works because if it doesn't work with a demo which is what every funded challenge starts with you're all trading with a demo account it's not real and if you start with 150 000 you're trying to make 150 000 turn into you know a six percent gain you know I think it's like nine thousand dollars my son failed several of them trying to do something he was not equal to which everybody knew that I mean they asked you know what is going on with your son I'll tell you he failed seven times seven times he failed because he doesn't know how to trade yet he thought he could do something on his own I'd let him do it and seven times he failed and TOP Step would confirm that and there's no you know there's no shame in that he he thought he could do something he was going to try to do it his own way and now and he's got to go back to square one and that's wonderful now he's teachable because he wasn't teachable while we were trying so now humbleness is now part of the equation which is necessary so when I show this I want you to think about the logic with some people that may come to me and Snicker and say in other areas around the internet and say ICT only does this in demo okay if you're going to try to get a funded account passed and get into a funded account you're going to be trading with a demo too and a lot of the funding companies are literally coming at me saying do a funded account with us do a funded account with us do it kind of I'm not going to do it folks okay um without saying anything more which would be viewed as being disrespectful just be thankful that my students are choosing your company whatever the company is I don't want to rep anybody because if I do that it sounds like I'm in bed with a company and I don't want to do any Affiliates I get lots of offers I don't want to do it but when I show you this I want you to know that it's important see the little arrows here and I'm showing also it's not Market replay Market replay has nothing to do with this when I click on this it tells you the prices you see all it have appears that all this stuff were real executions and when you see it like this you can see that there's a logic being implemented everything I've outlined here was the logic behind how I traded it I was bearish today I explained that to every Twitter feed follower that has and yesterday I was bearish and it behaved wonderfully yesterday as well go watch and look at my tweets I got so many requests coming at me do a funded account do a phone account you can't pass a funded account you can't do this you can't do that okay and I use the specifications that like a like TOP Step or that's that's the only company I apologize for other companies out there because it sounds like I'm not advertising for you I'm not advertising for TOP Step okay but I know because my son tried this they offer 150 000 funding and you gotta try to make nine thousand dollars okay I want you to look at the executions here and what I'm showing the logic I'm selling short up here building in a position they say you can trade with 15 contracts I built up positions up to 10 contracts here and never would have been stopped down never would have reached their 3 000 Max loss day never would have happened you can do the math here you can literally watch me do the executions recorded and share it on Twitter I called all these levels this the particular day here I called all that stuff on Twitter now there was a small period of time where my phone went into automatic update because I kept hitting remind me later every time Android auto a Galaxy Note 10. in Apple stock by the way I'll never have no Apple device but the bottom line is this I was talking non-stop about the market today in tweets pointing to where I think it's going to go and how you should follow along and we were looking for very specific price levels in this in this shaded area here you can see how the market dropped down we were looking for 40 70 something or other 40 75 40 76. in that area which was the top of that shaded area that's the reason why I liked it it's also an old low you can see how I covered three and then it got stopped out on the balance of seven but it was cut off and stopped out in profit on the balance at the time of the recording you can watch that on Twitter I'm not gonna I'm not gonna splice that in here I went back in with the expectation as soon as we went back up to new week opening gap which is from March 5th that's these dark black lines here okay once it traded back up into there I sold short again and built in another 10 position contract short pyramided in scaling in when I do this my typical MO is if I want to take a trade that I think is favorable I have the probabilities behind me I'll go in with six contracts first then three contracts and then one and it gives me a 10 lot that's how I usually build it in that's my model doesn't mean that you should do it that way it doesn't mean you should be trading with 10 contracts either I have the experience to do so okay the market trades into this level allows me to build up the position and then it trades down to the lower end and then the targets once we went below this low here I took a partial there see that right there watch the Arrow up here right there and then down here once it gets below that low so I'm scaling off profits there and then got stopped out on the balance again here then go on Twitter I said we were looking for 4063 was an Excel side which was below this low here I'm going to take these executions off just for a moment so it's a little bit cleaner I'll put them right back on in a minute I promise says look you can see what's going on I went short here which was the high end of that discount array or the imbalance on the daily chart expecting it to revisit and go after the sell side below here so what's the low on that candle right there four zero six three point five zero appears where you'd mean looking for that price level okay that candle is low four zero six three and a half so I want to get something lower than 4063.5 and I'm shorting up here why am I shorting right there I'll show you it's a breaker okay you can see it here high low higher high and then sells off here I made a remark on Twitter today which I'll build on when I go in the lower time frames to show you the actual breaker that I was looking at but this is it on the five minute chart so I'm selling short inside that breaker right in here I'm going short there six contracts adding three what price do I gotta get below this price low of 63.50 so four zero six three point five zero I have to aim for something lower than that my limit order fails at four zero six two and a half I take off three here because I believe that we're probably at a low of the day because we're going into non-farm payroll Friday price action it's delivered two of my targets and where are we at in that fair value gap on the daily chart that's shaded area in blue we're near the low of it and what time of the day is it noon New York local time so we're in lunch so what can it do run the stops what stops the buy stops above here and what does it do rallies on it so I took three off here after the first three here at 40 62 and a half I close manually three at 40 65 and three quarters then got stopped out and you can see

### **The Algorithm's Role in Order Flow**

So buy side was offered. That means from low to high, price went up. Now we have to see a pass through on the downside. This is real order flow.

The market trades from the high end of it down to the low end of it. Wow, interesting. It also finds support at that old **March 5th new week opening Gap low**. Well, isn't that interesting? What does the market do then? It rallies back up into that volume imbalance.

The market is bearish. Why do we know that and how do we know that? Well, **ICT** said the focus on 4068.75 and individuals on Twitter were saying no way is it going to go there okay it went there but the point is this when I'm talking to you on Twitter or if I go through the motions of outlining something I'm interested in which is what I've been doing I'm counseling you to submit to my experience so that way you can watch price the right way that way I'm lending you my 30 years of experience in being able to see this stuff before it happens the concepts are mine I codified them I authored them you can't use them correctly without me guiding you so I'm pointing to specific things in Twitter or when I do live streams and when the market gets a little bit cleaner I'll be back to live streaming but right now Twitter's enough the market trades up in that volume and balance consolidates hits the order block remember the 15-minute time frame and then drops rallies one more time and fails then strong rejection lower.

### **Impact of Employment Numbers at 8:30 AM**

So what was going on here at 8:30 right there when it rallied from here up to here that was that Employment Number that came out employment claims at 8 30. look at your economic calendar okay it trades up into some random High Not So Random when you're spending time with good old ICT that volume and balance right there so I was watching that and I want to see this price hold at that level and then reject and then have difficulty at the order block that was at 15 minutes I talked about this on Twitter this morning inside this area [Music] near the high of the old Gap that everybody else would have forgotten about which was the opening at 6 pm most people really don't trade that Gap they like the Gap that's formed in the morning with the which is what they call the overnight Gap it's not really overnight cap it's the opening range Gap and I have lectures coming that will teach a lot about that but for now I want you to see how I navigated this week how I looked at this particular day made over a hundred and some handles total for the week

*Look at your economic calendar.* The market trades up into some random High Not So Random. Spend time with good old **ICT** that volume and balance right there.

**6 PM Opening Gap vs. Overnight Gap**

Most people really don't trade that Gap. They like the Gap that's formed in the morning with the which is what they call the overnight Gap. It's not really overnight cap it's the opening range Gap and I have lectures coming that will teach a lot about that but for now I want you to see how I navigated this week how I looked at this particular day made over a hundred and some handles total for the week

### **Authoritative Teaching and Avoiding Misinterpretation**

And you can see right now if I right click on this go to settings I have to say this because invariably I get this as well if I'm supposed to be this rock star in trading and I made all these Concepts and I've done this and I've you know saved the world in in the world hunger and all these things the people out like the embellish and add to what I've only claimed that these are my Concepts and I authored them and no one's going to teach them better than me and you're not going to find anybody that can do it as good as me because they're mine that's not bragging I do that because I get so many questions by email and so many questions through trading view or questions by you know Twitter they'll ask me what do you think about this guy that's teaching your content or what do you think about this guy that's doing this with your content listen I understand there's a lot of people that are interested in it now my opinion is if you want to learn it you come here I'm doing it for free and you're going to get to get it right from the source there are a lot of people that I've trained lots of them and they use my name to draw a crowd I've given them the permission to do that but you as the student have to exercise due diligence in demand that they can do what they claim they can do because if they're going to just talk about something that's already happened in hindsight which many of you probably feel that's what's going on right here and I promise I'm going to dispel all that right now you have to understand that there's a lot of people that can take this language that I've given out to the public and it can sound smart in hindsight they can explain it away after it's happened but it's altogether something different sitting in front of a live audience quarter million strong half a million strong and call it with no safety net

I'm doing it for free, and you're going to get to get it right from the source.

There are a lot of people that I've trained, lots of them, and they use my name to draw a crowd. I've given them the permission to do that, but you as the student have to exercise due diligence and demand that they can do what they claim they can do because if they're going to just talk about something that's already happened in hindsight which many of you probably feel that's what's going on right here and I promise I'm going to dispel all that right now you have to understand that there's a lot of people that can take this language that I've given out to the public and it can sound smart in hindsight they can explain it away after it's happened but it's altogether something different sitting in front of a live audience quarter million strong half a million strong and call it with no safety net

**Demo Accounts and Funded Challenges**

I don't need to have a live account to show you this stuff works because if it doesn't work with a demo which is what every funded challenge starts with you're all trading with a demo account it's not real and if you start with 150 000 you're trying to make 150 000 turn into you know a six percent gain you know I think it's like nine thousand dollars my son failed several of them trying to do something he was not equal to which everybody knew that I mean they asked you know what is going on with your son I'll tell you he failed seven times seven times he failed because he doesn't know how to trade yet he thought he could do something on his own I'd let him do it and seven times he failed and TOP Step would confirm that and there's no you know there's no shame in that he he thought he could do something he was going to try to do it his own way and now and he's got to go back to square one and that's wonderful now he's teachable because he wasn't teachable while we were trying so now humbleness is now part of the equation which is necessary so when I show this I want you to think about the logic with some people that may come to me and Snicker and say in other areas around the internet and say ICT only does this in demo okay if you're going to try to get a funded account passed and get into a funded account you're going to be trading with a demo too and a lot of the funding companies are literally coming at me saying do a funded account with us do a funded account with us do it kind of I'm not going to do it folks okay um without saying anything more which would be viewed as being disrespectful just be thankful that my students are choosing your company whatever the company is I don't want to rep anybody because if I do that it sounds like I'm in bed with a company and I don't want to do any Affiliates I get lots of offers I don't want to do it but when I show you this I want you to know that it's important see the little arrows here and I'm showing also

what stops the buy stops above here and what does it do rallies on it so I took three off here after the first three here at 40 62 and a half I close manually three at 40 65 and three quarters then got stopped out and you can see

If you're going to try to get a funded account passed and get into a funded account, you're going to be trading with a demo too, and a lot of the funding companies are literally coming at me saying do a funded account with us do a funded account with us do it kind of I'm not going to do it folks. Without saying anything more which would be viewed as being disrespectful just be thankful that my students are choosing your company whatever the company is I don't want to rep anybody because if I do that it sounds like I'm in bed with a company and I don't want to do any Affiliates I get lots of offers I don't want to do it but when I show you this I want you to know that it's important

When I show you this I want you to know that it's important see the little arrows here and I'm showing also it's not Market replay Market replay has nothing to do with this when I click on this it tells you the prices you see all it have appears that all this stuff were real executions and when you see it like this you can see that there's a logic being implemented everything I've outlined here was the logic behind how I traded it I was bearish today I explained that to every Twitter feed follower that has and yesterday I was bearish and it behaved wonderfully yesterday as well go watch and look at my tweets I got so many requests coming at me do a funded account do a phone account you can't pass a funded account you can't do this you can't do that okay and I use the specifications that like a like **TOP Step** or that's that's the only company I apologize for other companies out there because it sounds like I'm not advertising for you I'm not advertising for **TOP Step** okay but I know because my son tried this they offer 150 000 funding and you gotta try to make nine thousand dollars okay

### **Real Executions and Market Logic**

And I'm showing also it's not Market replay Market replay has nothing to do with this when I click on this it tells you the prices you see all it have appears that all this stuff were real executions and when you see it like this you can see that there's a logic being implemented everything I've outlined here was the logic behind how I traded it I was bearish today I explained that to every Twitter feed follower that has and yesterday I was bearish and it behaved wonderfully yesterday as well go watch and look at my tweets I got so many requests coming at me do a funded account do a phone account you can't pass a funded account you can't do this you can't do that okay and I use the specifications that like a like **TOP Step** or that's that's the only company I apologize for other companies out there because it sounds like I'm not advertising for you I'm not advertising for **TOP Step** okay but I know because my son tried this they offer 150 000 funding and you gotta try to make nine thousand dollars okay

**Bearish Outlook and Trading Strategy**

I was bearish today, I explained that to every Twitter feed follower that has and yesterday I was bearish and it behaved wonderfully yesterday as well. Go watch and look at my tweets.

### **Trading with Contracts: Building and Scaling Positions**

They say you can trade with 15 contracts. I built up positions up to 10 contracts here and never would have been stopped down never would have reached their 3 000 Max loss day never would have happened you can do the math here you can literally watch me do the executions recorded and share it on Twitter I called all these levels this the particular day here I called all that stuff on Twitter now there was a small period of time where my phone went into automatic update because I kept hitting remind me later every time Android auto a Galaxy Note 10. in Apple stock by the way I'll never have no Apple device but the bottom line is this I was talking non-stop about the market today in tweets pointing to where I think it's going to go and how you should follow along and we were looking for very specific price levels in this in this shaded area here you can see how the market dropped down we were looking for 40 70 something or other 40 75 40 76. in that area which was the top of that shaded area that's the reason why I liked it it's also an old low you can see how I covered three and then it got stopped out on the balance of seven but it was cut off and stopped out in profit on the balance at the time of the recording you can watch that on Twitter I'm not gonna I'm not gonna splice that in here I went back in with the expectation as soon as we went back up to new week opening gap which is from March 5th that's these dark black lines here okay once it traded back up into there I sold short again and built in another 10 position contract short pyramided in scaling in when I do this my typical MO is if I want to take a trade that I think is favorable I have the probabilities behind me I'll go in with six contracts first then three contracts and then one and it gives me a 10 lot that's how I usually build it in that's my model doesn't mean that you should do it that way it doesn't mean you should be trading with 10 contracts either I have the experience to do so okay the market trades into this level allows me to build up the position and then it trades down to the lower end and then the targets once we went below this low here I took a partial there see that right there watch the Arrow up here right there and then down here once it gets below that low so I'm scaling off profits there and then got stopped out on the balance again here then go on Twitter I said we were looking for 4063 was an Excel side which was below this low here I'm going to take these executions off just for a moment so it's a little bit cleaner I'll put them right back on in a minute I promise says look you can see what's going on I went short here which was the high end of that discount array or the imbalance on the daily chart expecting it to revisit and go after the sell side below here so what's the low on that candle right there four zero six three point five zero appears where you'd mean looking for that price level okay that candle is low four zero six three and a half so I want to get something lower than 4063.5 and I'm shorting up here why am I shorting right there I'll show you it's a breaker okay you can see it here high low higher high and then sells off here I made a remark on Twitter today which I'll build on when I go in the lower time frames to show you the actual breaker that I was looking at but this is it on the five minute chart so I'm selling short inside that breaker right in here I'm going short there six contracts adding three what price do I gotta get below this price low of 63.50 so four zero six three point five zero I have to aim for something lower than that my limit order fails at four zero six two and a half I take off three here because I believe that we're probably at a low of the day because we're going into non-farm payroll Friday price action it

Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, adhering to all the stated requirements:

### **Review of Previous Trades and Strategy**

On the video, it got stopped out on the final three in profit at 4072.25, and then I waited until 2:00 PM. I went in short again. What am I shorting? I'm shorting on the idea that we went all the way back up to the high of what area again? That **new day opening Gap**, the separation between where we started trading at 6:00 PM my local time on Wednesday, and then we stopped trading at 5:00 PM on my local time on Wednesday. So that's the new day opening Gap. Extend that forward, folks. The algorithm is going to refer back to that same price level again.

Anybody that tells you once a gap fills, you're done with it, discard and dismiss what they just said. They have no idea what they're talking about. I promise you, I'm not trying to be disrespectful. I'm not trying to be belligerent. I'm not trying to say, don't look and learn from anybody else. I'm just saying if anything I'm saying and proving that it works, and they have books, they have courses, they have mentorships, they have things that they're trying to teach you, and they say this is the way to do it, they're not fully informed, that's all I'm saying, okay? That's all I'm saying. You decide who you want to listen to, but you know the devil's in the details here, folks.

So I sold short here because we went up to the bottom end of that same **new day opening Gap**. In the next candle here, we open, and by the time I got to the screens, it allowed me to get filled there at that price, 4085.25. My stop was above the new day, I'm sorry, the **new week opening gap on the 5th of March**. One more time, it bumps the low of the **new week opening gap of March 2023**, then accelerates to the downside. And what am I aiming for? The sell side right below this low here.

*   What's this candle's low? We're looking right here.
*   Up here in the upper left-hand corner, the lower that candle is 4071.75.

So what do I have to get? I have to get a fill of 4071.50 or less. So I had a limit order placed right below there, and nine order was filled at 4071.50, one tick below that low, and the low of the day was 0.25 or not low today below that candle. So I was within the measurement of one tick.

Then it rises back up to what level? Some random level, right? No, it's the **new week opening Gap from March 5th,** and it's also what folks? The **new day opening Gap**, that shaded area. The algorithm is going back to these same price levels, okay?

### **Market Analysis and Algorithm Behavior**

I was all over this thing, but I had to go shopping with my wife, and I was going to take another short from here to take out that low, and I would have done the same thing I did there and added more to it.

*   Then what does it do once it takes the sell side here? Where's it going to go back to? Buy side.
*   Where's buy side? Above that short-term High, also where else?
*   Consequent encroachment, which is the midpoint between a high and a low, a **new week opening Gap midpoint**. Bang!
*   Where's it go? Damn! What's it gonna sweep again? Old order flow.

That's the real level here, not each one of these, because now we have one, two, three. Where are the bodies? They're stopping short of that low, so the parent price swing and liquidity pool is this one. I'll have more about that in my book, but the point is you like that plug. You like that little twist of the knife? Oh, ICT, you're so diabolical, whatever.

But the point is this, the market trades back down and rallies back up, fall short of this high, but now what do we have? What do we have here? Relative equal highs, runs right through them, and goes to what level? The high of the **March 5th 2023 new week opening Gap High**. Look at the candle work right there, folks. Look at that. That's not random. It's gravitating to these same levels because you think it's buying and selling pressure, and you think that the depth of Market, the market profile, the b-wop, and all those things, you think that's order flow?

You think that's really measuring the intricacies of price action and you have no idea what you're doing? No idea.

### **Response to Requests for Funded Account Demonstrations**

So to answer the folks that asked me to go do a funded account, do a live account, do this, do that, listen, I've done all that stuff, okay? I've done a live account. I've put it up there. I even flipped a quarter and still made 100 in five weeks on TD Ameritrade. You can see it up there on my YouTube channel. There it is.

In my opinion, I did what I think a new student would do in the course of one year, but I did it in five weeks, okay? I think I'm making 100, which is exactly what I teach to try to aim for six percent a month. Will you hit six percent a month? Probably not, but if you did, you could double your account regardless of whatever the account balance is when you first start it, you can double it.

So my question to you is, why are you asking me to perform tricks when I do this all the time? I'm calling it live. I call it live in tweets. I can't erase them. I can't delete them. I don't delete anything. And when I'm doing live streams, I'm literally calling every one minute tick. Why? On the lowest latency, you get the highest degree of delivery from whenever I say something, whatever my chart's showing, you get it on that stream right to your computer as fast as the internet will give it to you, and I'm doing it without a safety net.

So you see people out there saying all kinds of terrible things, you know, ICT this and ICT that. This is every detail, okay? Every single detail shown. I'm not hiding anything. There's zip shown elsewhere. It's all shown here.

There's nothing else I can add that can be toggled. I'm gonna physically walk through every single one of these. This is the first trade. You see all the details that pop up here, okay? This account started with what you would have with a funded account challenge of 150,000. You got to make nine thousand dollars in five days, folks. I did sixteen thousand, nineteen thousand nine hundred and thirty seven dollars fifty cents perfectly today, perfectly multiple times. And I traded in a day.

I teach my students, don't touch. I was all over this thing like white on rice. The next trade, here's the details. Here's the details on the next one. These are all partials or entries, okay? Look at that, okay? See that? You can pause the video and look at everything. I'm not hiding anything. I'm not doing things surreptitiously. I'm not gaming trading view. I have an account that I force my son to do executions on. He practices, he does things, he shows things trading view. I'm sure you can watch my account.

Bottom line is, they can see when my son's pushing the button versus when I'm doing it. When I'm doing it, I'm murdering it. I'm literally all over this thing murdering it. When things aren't looking kosher, when they look like they're really making sense, that's my son being told, execute when you think there's something to go on, and he gets frustrated, and he he reboots it, starts it over.

### **Account Resetting and TradingView Monitoring**

I'm gonna do that right now because I don't like keeping a running account because I know if I was at TradingView and I could see ICT's trades, I would put a trade copier on this. I'm not allowing them. I won't allow them to do that. I'm not suggesting that they are, but listen, you would do it too.

I know I would if I knew the hottest dog in this industry that can do the things I'm doing and proving and teaching people making half a million dollars in the same year or so or a little bit more than a year, folks, that's somebody to watch. That's somebody to listen to, and if they can find a way to mimic whatever they're doing, if I push a button in a demo account and I run these accounts up like this, wouldn't you want to put a trade copier on it?

You see any losing trades here? No. I facetiously in the past do things it's to make red appear in here. I can do this every freaking day, every day. I can walk these markets up, down, sideways, whatever you want to do with it, I can do it. I don't need to do your challenges. I don't need to do your championships. I don't need to do your competitions. I don't need to do anything because what I'm doing is far way way way better, light years ahead of everything else, period.

So do the math on this. This is pretend that I took these types of Trades over five days, I would have smoked any of your challenges and I would be funded. I don't need to be funded. I'm already freaking rich. I don't need to do it. I'm teaching you. You're the student. If you want to learn from me, go somewhere else. I'm not holding any of you hostage, but I'm not going to be doing tricks for for requests. I'm not.

I'm not doing party favors, hey, um, you know, can you do this, can you do that? I'm not doing that folks. I'm teaching you how to do this. I'm literally spending my time, which I don't have to do. I'm spending my time with you teaching you exactly what you should be doing, the correct way to learn how to do this independent from me, because in November of this year, in 2023, I stop. I want to have my life back.

### **Skills and Partnership Opportunities**

So take the time instead of asking me to do tricks for you, instead of me trying to perform something that's easy for me just because you can't do it or you think I can't do it. I can do it anytime I want, anytime I want. I can trade in any Market condition.

If it was a real tight sloppy market like when I went down to Florida in South Carolina MRI, I could have done a whole lot of three pip handles, two Pips handled and ran up something just like this. It would be like 50 trades, but I can get these same results here in small little market increments, but you have no idea. You have no idea. I'm giving you models that you can do very very well with. You don't need to do this many trades, but I just wanted to convince all of you that are on the fence thinking that oh, well, he does this because you listen to people. They lie because they're selling something or they're just short of an attention. They don't get attention where they're at the internet so because I get a lot of it and I've worked my ass off for it. Nobody else is doing as much as I've done in this industry for free and I've given my core content that people paid for for free on the YouTube channel.

Hello, ask everybody that sells stuff to give their stuff for free. Think folks, I have the goods. I'm making real winning Traders. I'm producing winning Traders. They're being interviewed. They're getting paid out. They're getting real money. They're starting with things that they didn't have the money with and I said this in my mentorship.

You can find people that will partner up with you. Now, there's funded accounts. They didn't have funding accounts when I first started. They may not be in existence in the future to maybe regulated to the point where they're not permitted. I don't know. I don't I can't see in the future in that regard, but even if you don't have a funded account a company working with you if you can produce results believe me there's always somebody out there that has money and they will say hey let's go into a partnership a limited partnership you and I we go into it we're both our names are on the count you do the trades and we'll split at 50 50. there's nothing illegal about that there's zero illegal things about that you're going into a partnership and it should be legally binding you don't need money to do it you need the skill set once you learn this skill set it's yours nobody can take it from you nobody can talk it down nobody can discount it nobody can say it's not real or it's fake or it's this and that folks these are results that people want to have this is the stuff that people want everything here is shown every box is toggled everything here is shared nothing is hidden nothing is photoshopped I can't get this thing to scroll down there you go there it is okay everything is shown your challenges are Mickey Mouse to me this is this is nonsense asking me to do something that is nothing for me like nine thousand dollars I don't need multiple accounts to do that I don't need to have you know all these things linked together and have trade Copier on three four five accounts that you need to see things pan out in my favor I have one account and not even use the maximum 15 contracts if I can do what I teach and what I show always I didn't create something new today to do this everything's here folks and this is what I do all the time because I don't want people in these companies that I execute on and teach my son my sons with to copy me

### **Account Management and Future Plans**

So now we're back at 150. I didn't erase a bad account. I didn't reset a bad account. I'm doing everything here that I do all the time around accounts the show my son I'm showing you and I reset it now I tell him now you do this you do that you do this and he there does well he doesn't and because he's new he's not doing well he doesn't know how to trade I'm teaching him how to trade so for folks that are asking that's where he's at so anyway there's the details everything was here now watch if I go to a chart like Dixie and go back to ES everything is Virgin Again and there it is I do that all the time because I know if it's possible for those individuals at trading for you to watch me they can sync up an account now can they just hurry up and resync it to a new one whatever but I let my son go in at random times to go in there and execute so they don't know if the trades I'm about to take for him or me and believe me if they're trying to do that they're going to be very frustrated so that's another reason why I want to stop you in November because I don't have to do these things anymore it'll be something that it's entirely all him but because I'm teaching him I want him to do it with my account I want to be able to watch what he does and see what he's doing and what I do is I go and I start the account with one trade that I know is mine and he can't reset it because he gets frustrated and he wants to reset everything like he wants to erase like it didn't happen I keep telling him all the time you have to you have to show me what you're doing because I can't fix the things that you have as problems until I see the errors that you're doing so there it is you know I don't need to do your funded account challenges none of them are hard they're very easy and I don't need to have five days or minimum days I can do it all I can do twice okay three times what you have to do to get funded I can do that all in one day with one account new copy and nothing and do it flawlessly with new losing trades

### **Final Thoughts on Trading Education**

So there's my answer to the people keep asking me for it this is exactly what you would have seen with a top step funded account or anybody else out there if it was me driving it so please with all due respect stop asking me to do Mickey Mouse stuff because I'm not interested in that I don't need to do that kind of stuff I'm calling the market when I'm out there live it's dancing for me and when it isn't and I can't do it because it's either being too fickle and I'm not trying to do two two to three handle moves because you're all going to be like well that's the thing I want to learn when that's a very hard thing to do because you don't know when to stop when you can do that if you're new high frequency trading is something that a new Trader should not be


Here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, adhering to all the stated requirements:

### **Understanding Market Charts and Trading Concepts**

When you start trading, charts can seem like a foreign language.

*   Look at a chart devoid of annotation.
*   New traders often don't know what information to pull from it.

The concepts being taught are designed to help you navigate **time and price**. The information is presented logically, with repeating phenomena. These phenomena aren't limited to the present and repeat over time.

*   Refer back to what was mentioned or posted on **Twitter**.
*   The executions shown match **TradingView**.

**TradingView** can verify the accuracy of the statements.

*   They can see if what's being said is fake or a lie.
*   They are welcome to publicly refute it if it's untrue.

### **Upcoming Lectures and Teaching Philosophy**

Two lectures will be presented:

*   **Saturday:** **New Week Opening Gap** (Introductory lesson for the 2023 mentorship on YouTube).
*   **Sunday:** **New Day Opening Gap**.

The lectures won't be terribly long but will include important details. The goal is to teach, not just perform magic tricks.

*   Be willing to sit down and take all the information in.
*   Make the information your own.
*   Let it resonate with you.

It's not about watching performances, but about learning and applying the concepts.

### **Trading Methodology and Market Conditions**

Today's trading primarily involved:

*   **Premium and discount**.
*   **Time and price**.
*   **Liquidity**.
*   Specifically, the **March 5th New Week Opening Gap**.
*   The **New Day Opening Gap** formed on Wednesday at 6 PM.

Even in choppy, sloppy market conditions, these types of trades can be done.

*   This is reminiscent of 1990s trading.

However, the goal isn't to teach operating in those conditions. It requires patience and discipline.

*   New traders under guidance may not have that yet.
*   **V-Wop, Market Profile, Elliott Wave, Supply and Demand, and harmonic patterns** may not be effective.
*   These methods try to force patterns when the market doesn't respect them.

The information being taught is the **source code for the market**. Whether you believe it is up to you.

### **Addressing Requests and Offering Knowledge**

Requests for demonstrations are no longer being entertained. Instead, try to replicate the work being done.

*   Try to do as much for free and as precisely as it's being done.

The goal is to leave the community with something valuable.

*   Hoping you will learn it and do exceedingly well.
*   Many students are publicly demonstrating their success.
*   Many more are succeeding privately.

### **Recent Activities and Market Outlook**

There are more interviews coming up. Recently, some personal time was taken off while the market was fickle. Hopefully, volatility is increasing, making it more favorable for teaching intraday price action.

### **Concluding Remarks**

If you've made it through the entire video and lecture, congratulations. You're likely equipped to learn. If you're new, welcome. See you next time, and be safe.

# **ICT New Week Opening Gap: A Deeper Dive into Price Action**

## **Introduction**

Welcome back, folks! This is the second part of my exploration into the **ICT New Week Opening Gap** concept. We're focusing on finding real value in price action by stripping back retail logic and understanding the underpinnings of the marketplace.
*   Video URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BM1mqQv-ypk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BM1mqQv-ypk)

## **Retail Logic vs. Institutional Understanding**

*   Retail traders typically buy support and short resistance.
*   My approach focuses on the **root cause** and **draws on liquidity**: areas where price should support or resist based on logic, not random levels.
*   I'm not a fan of horizontal or diagonal trend support/resistance.

## **New Week Opening Gaps as Draws on Liquidity**

*   Each set of horizontal lines represents an individual **New Week Opening Gap**.
*   Price gravitates towards these gaps:
    *   It may pass through them quickly.
    *   It may consolidate around them.
    *   It may expand to the next gap.

## **Comparison to Pivot Numbers**

*   Pivot numbers (floor trader's pivot numbers) used to act as a magnet for price.
*   I abandoned them for better tools.
*   **Draw on liquidity**: Equal highs and lows act as magnets for price (buy stops above highs, sell stops below lows).
*   The same magnetic effect is seen with **New Week Opening Gaps**.

## **Opening Prices: Not Random Events**

*   Openings are **not random**.
*   The first tick of the market when the new week opens (6 PM New York local time) is **significant**.
*   Price respects this level throughout the week and in the future (weeks and months).

## **Using the Sunday Opening Price**

*   It's important to know the opening price on Sunday.
*   I've taught in other lectures to extend that Sunday opening price throughout the entire current trading week.
*   As of this recording (Sunday, May 7, 2023), the price at 6 PM tonight will be extended throughout the week.
*   The **entire New Week Opening Gap range (high and low)** will be projected into the future for many weeks.

## **Defining the New Week Opening Gap**

*   Consider the example from March 5, 2023, at 6 PM.
*   **Define the opposite end** of the gap by looking at the previous Friday's closing price.
*   The New Week Opening Gap is the difference between these two price points.

## **Closing Prices: Also Not Random**

*   Closing prices are **not random** either.
*   Contrary to what "Talking Heads" in the industry might say, price isn't completely random.
*   My students have observed how price respects these gaps not just on the day they form, but weeks and months later.

## **Closer Look at March 3rd and 5th, 2023**

*   Friday, March 3rd, 2023, is the last closing price before the session ends.
*   We have two price points:
    *   **Opening price:** Sunday, March 5th
    *   **Closing price:** Friday, March 3rd
*   The space between these points is the **New Week Opening Gap**.

## **Defining the ICT New Week Opening Gap**

*   An **ICT New Week Opening Gap** is the separation between the Friday closing price and the subsequent Sunday opening price.
*   If Friday's closing price is *above* Sunday's opening price:
    *   Friday's closing price is the **high** of the gap.
    *   Sunday's opening price is the **low** of the gap.
*   If the roles are reversed, the labels are diametrically opposed.

## **Extending the Gap into the Future**

*   Using the March 3rd and March 5th gap, we extend it into the week.
*   Price treats it as resistance, pulls away, rallies through, then comes back down.
*   Notice two passes with a separation:
    *   Buy-side was offered.
    *   Sell-side was lacking, then movement on the downside occurred.
*   Price moves away, runs buy-side, trades below a short-term low, and gravitates around the gap, still respecting it.
*   These are 5-minute candles.
*   Price trades up, finds support, and springs higher for buy-side trades.
*   Trades to a new week opening gap below.

## **New Week Opening Gaps as Magnets**

*   Price treats these gaps as **magnets**.
*   Creates a willingness to return to them, a fair value function in price delivery.
*   The gap is **engineered and designed**, not random.
*   Smart money uses these old reference points throughout the future week, month, and even for several months.

## **Trending Signatures with New Week Opening Gaps**

*   When a market indicates it wants to trend, observe the New Week Opening Gap.
*   Extending the same week forward, notice the amount of time inside the gap, then an aggressive run lower.
*   A sudden move away indicates a **trending market**.
*   We moved away but only until a New Week Opening Gap defined resistance and went lower.

## **Large Fractal View: Hourly Chart**

*   Here's the same gap on an hourly chart.
*   Look at the price movement away.
*   This concept allows an "x-ray view" behind price: what is it likely to do?
*   If there's a willingness to sharply move away from the current gap, it's likely we're entering a **trending model**.
*   Trending model means longer moves and more magnitude behind the price moves.

## **Consolidation Signatures with New Week Opening Gaps**

*   I look for a willingness to sharply move away above or below the current gap.
*   **Current New Week Opening Gap:** The weekly open separation between Sunday's open and the previous week's Friday close.
*   If price has an *unwillingness* to move away and keeps returning to the gap, we're probably going to be **range-bound and consolidating**.
*   In this case, you have to be a scalper.

## **Characteristics of a Consolidation Market**

*   A multitude of New Week Opening Gaps converging within a range.
*   Example: multiple gap highs and lows in close proximity.
*   Shaded blue area represents the New Week Opening Gap for that week.
*   **When there's a convergence of multiple gaps, markets tend to enter a range-bound environment.**
*   This helps analyze and predict range-bound conditions.
*   You have to be a scalper.

## **Price Action within Consolidation**

*   Significant price moves *can* occur within consolidation.
*   Looking for highs and lows to be violated and pulled back into the middle (the blue shaded area).
*   Every decline draws back inside the blue gap.
*   Every rally above it comes back down into it.
*   If it expands above to take out buy-side, it then goes back down into that shaded area.
*   If it goes beyond that, it will likely go down below inside the *old* gap in close proximity.

## **Chart Management: Keeping Track of New Week Opening Gaps**

*   Keep the New Week Opening Gaps on your chart.
*   Create a separate chart template labeled "New Week Opening Gap".
*   Constantly refer back to these gaps, which act as magnets on price action.

## **Integration with Other Factors**

*   Don't rely solely on the gaps.
*   Incorporate other factors taught on this channel and in the core content.
*   All factors blended together provide a better understanding of where price is likely to draw to.
*   Incorporate these old or current gaps because price will treat them as magnets, re-test them, and then spring away for a short-term scalp or a trending model.

## **Navigating Price with New Week Opening Gaps: A Current Example**

*   Here's a current fractal and price action showing the Friday Non-Farm Payroll for May 5th, 2023.
*   Old low where sell-side resides.
*   Market trades down below both lows and into a fair value gap on the daily chart.
*   Mentioned this during commentary on Twitter ahead of the non-farm payroll.
*   Market gyrates around the New Week Opening Gap from March 3rd.

## **Using Past Levels in Current Analysis**

*   We are in May 2023, using levels from March 3rd and 5th (Friday's closing price and Sunday's opening price).
*   Extending those levels throughout time.
*   Look at the sensitivity: closing price on the candle, lower wicks, bodies of candles stacking above the high of the March 3rd gap.
*   Then we move higher, come back down, and there's an offer on the payroll event.
*   Price rallies and gravitates to the closest gap.
*   It reaches for the other above, retraces, comes back down, fills the gap, and expands away, reaching into the consequent encroachment of the wick.

## **New Week Opening Gaps as Mile Markers**

*   Price wants to move to these levels as a magnet.
*   They can be mile markers (initial targets) or ultimate targets.
*   **Note:** If price is likely to go higher between two New Week Opening Gaps, and it reaches the halfway point, the probability is high that it will reach through the next gap in the series of the last several weeks and months.

## **Fair Value Gaps and New Week Opening Gaps**

*   Closer look at a 15-minute time frame.
*   Fair Value Gap laid over the same March 3rd and 5th New Week Opening Gap.
*   Why use this? This gap runs through all of this data.
*   **Note:** If you're seeing price in consolidation, go back through time and see what New Week Opening Gap extends through that area.

## **How Many New Week Opening Gaps to Use?**

*   Whatever today is in trading, I look back **60 days**.
*   Those who have gone through my core content (Month 5) know the **IPDA data range**: the **60-day look back and the 60-day cast forward.**
*   I only look back 60 days, and that's the maximum I have on my charts.
*   Counsel you on the first part during this mentorship in 2023 on my YouTube channel that you want to have at least five.
*   As you improve, use the 60-day look back period that I use for IPDA data ranges.
*   Many discounted it, but it's a **major impact** to my analysis.

## **Validity of PD Arrays and the Time Aspect**

*   How much data am I using?
*   Which PD array am I going to consider still valid?
*   Fair Value Gap for instance, if you go back 60 days, still valid even if it's already been filled in.
*   I'm not done with it; the algorithm isn't done with it either.
*   It will refer back to it and respect that same old level because of the time aspect that's incorporated in algorithmic price delivery.

## **Conclusion**

I hope you found this insightful and that I've added more insight into New Week Opening Gaps. Until next time, be safe.

# **New Day Opening Gap (NDOG) Analysis**

## **Introduction**

Welcome back, folks! This module delves into the **New Day Opening Gap (NDOG)**, a concept similar to the New Week Opening Gap. Just as the New Week Opening Gap is not random, neither are the openings observed in NDOG. We'll examine the NDOG in detail, focusing on the opening price.

### **Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sh-bDHWNpsk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sh-bDHWNpsk)

## **Understanding the New Day Opening Gap**

### **Example: May 3rd, 2023**

We'll be looking at the example of **May 3rd, 2023**.

*   The chart shows a five-minute timeframe.
*   You'll see the **6 PM restart** following an hour break in Futures Trading.

### **Opening Price Definition**

The **opening price** is the *very first tick* or traded price. It's not random; it is offered to the market and whichever trade gets filled first marks the start of the NDOG.

### **Closing Price Significance**

*   The **closing price** from the previous session is also important.
*   Closing prices, as previously discussed, *are not random price events*.

### **NDOG Formation**

The NDOG forms every day from Monday to Friday. (Excluding Fridays because that’s when the New Week Opening Gap forms between Friday's close and Sunday's open.) The difference between the closing price of the previous session and the opening price of the new session creates the NDOG.

*   The closing price is at **5 PM** in the given example.
*   The market then reopens at **6 PM** after one hour, creating the NDOG.

### **Time Zone Note**

The speaker references **May 3rd** in the video, because in their time zone, midnight of the fourth starts their May 4th. However, on TradingView, this is all factored as part of **May 4th** trading, to avoid confusion between price points.

## **Extending the NDOG into Future Price Action**

### **NDOG as Support and Resistance**

Here's the same NDOG data, with additional data points to show how extending the NDOG into future price action can be significant.

*   The gap originates from **Wednesday's 6 PM** close (New York time).
*   The NDOG is extended through the 4th and even into Non-Farm Payroll Friday.

### **Observing Price Respect**

Pay close attention to how the price interacts with the extended NDOG:

*   Acts as **support** at times.
*   Acts as **resistance** at other times.
*   Price often **consolidates around it**, finding an equilibrium between the high and low.
*   The price often gravitates around the NDOG level.
*   First, price offers a **buy side**, then a **sell side**, before rallying.
*   Price trades into **inefficiencies**, then sells off. (Trades from this action were shown in a previous review.)
*   The NDOG creates resistance *multiple times*.
*   Eventually, it provides support, a *sweep of the stops*, and then a rally.
*   After Non-Farm Payroll data, it provides more support and resistance.

## **NDOG Considerations and Best Practices**

### **Meaningful Separation**

*   Similar to the New Week Opening Gap, the NDOG may not always form with a *significant gap*.
*   Sometimes there is little separation between the 5 PM close and the 6 PM open.
*   If the separation is minimal (one or two ticks), it may be respected, but isn't a good candidate for NDOG strategy. The speaker generally prefers to see *meaningful separation*.

### **Preferred Characteristics**

*   Ideally, the separation should be **more than one handle**.
*   There isn't a specific number of handles or points the speaker looks for, but the gap must be more than one handle.

### **Weekly Relevance**

*   The NDOG is primarily useful for the *current trading week*.
*   Once the week closes, the speaker no longer considers that specific NDOG relevant.
*   For example, if the current week has passed, levels based on it aren't interesting in a new trading week.
*   The speaker utilizes the *very first* NDOG of the week and extends it.

### **Example: ES Analysis**

Reviewing ES charts, you might find only one *meaningful* NDOG. Notice how price treated it into Thursday and Friday's trading.

### **Closing the Gap**

*   If the NDOG is closed, it *doesn't mean the level is abandoned*.
*   The area can be revisited in the future, and price can continue to gravitate around it.
*   These levels often act as impactful support or resistance levels for the week.

## **Confluence with Other PD Arrays**

### **Repricing and Confluence**

It's not simply about touching the NDOG and reacting. Consider other factors.

*   Touching an NDOG isn't *just* acting as support to go higher.
*   Look for confluence with other PD arrays.

### **Example Scenario**

An old NDOG low extends forward, and a fair value gap (buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency) is present.

*   The area from here to here represents a fair value gap or optimal trade entry (OTE).
*   Price drops into the gap, retests the NDOG below, finds support, and rallies.
*   Price hits it again, taking out sell-side liquidity in the form of relative equal lows.

### **London Session Example**

*   The price digs below during the London session on Friday, rallies, and hits the high.
*   A low, high, and lower low formation indicates a bullish breaker.
*   Price trades into it after hitting the fair value gap.
*   Price respects the *bodies* of the candles; they *don't close below* the NDOG high. The wicks do the damage, but the bodies tell the story.
*   Dipping into the old NDOG high allows price to move higher towards a fair value gap and order block, initiating a rally.

## **NDOG as a Supporting Factor**

### **Not a Standalone Strategy**

NDOGs should *support* an idea that has already been established using other PD arrays or analysis concepts.

*   It is **not** a "blind" or "Panacea" approach.
*   It's an additional tool to add to your analysis.

### **Repricing**

If the NDOG hasn't repriced to the high, the speaker likes to see it trade up into and reprice that. The opposite is true when the NDOG gaps higher.

### **Bread and Butter Trade Example**

If the price opens, trades down, and consolidates around the low of the NDOG gap, trading up to the high of the NDOG would be a simple, easy scalp. This could be implemented in an Asian session.

## **Conclusion**

Hopefully, this explanation of the NDOG has been insightful. Be safe, and until next time!

# ICT Sick Sister Concept Explained

## Introduction

Good afternoon, folks! Welcome back. Today, I'm going to explain the **ICT Sick Sister concept**. If you were confused by my tweets today, hopefully this will clear things up. I'm also going to show you why I chose to use the NASDAQ today.

## Economic Calendar Context

The economic calendar this week is heavy on **Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday**. Monday and Tuesday are lacking any real meaningful medium or high-impact news drivers. This means we can expect consolidation days, which is what we're seeing here.

*   I don't view this as a swing or trending day.
*   Price is basically staying within the range of this. Below this high was just slightly penetrated and then back inside the range between the high here and the low here, so we have consolidated.
*   That doesn't mean it can't be traded, but you have to be much more nimble and versed in market symmetry.

## Consolidation Market and New Week Opening Gaps

Because it's going to be a consolidation market, I mentioned on Twitter that we had an old and new week opening gap in close proximity to our current new week opening gap. (I'm going to save time and energy by not showing it here on the chart. You can find that on my tweets).

## Market Analysis: Dow, NASDAQ, and ES

### Dow Jones Industrial Average (Dow)

*   Notice that this market here on the Dow was able to make a **higher high**.

### NASDAQ

*   The NASDAQ was **unwilling to make that higher high**.

### SMT and Sick Sister Concept

I teach that the **Sick Sister** is similar but **not the same as SMT (Smart Money Technique)**. There are conditions with a trending market where the Sick Sister opportunity will see a move to hasn't transpired yet on one asset or correlated market meeting or exceeding an old high or an old low.

*   Because the high here was taken out by this high on Dow, it would be reasonable to expect in a symmetrical market that the NASDAQ itself would go up here and hit that too.
*   But look closer, what do you see? There's a failure here. So this high is higher than this one whereas this high is higher.

### E-mini S&P 500 (ES)

*   The ES was also able to make a higher high, but it didn't make that higher high there.

### Divergence Analysis

*   We have a very specific time of day, and we're also looking at this Divergence.
*   If I show you on the Dow, we penetrated this high here at 8 AM.
*   On the ES, we made a higher high here, but we did not make the higher high here at eight o'clock, so this high was lower than this one.
*   If we look at the NASDAQ, we had that lower high across both this high didn't get penetrated this high didn't get penetrated and were diverging.

## Sick Sister Approach in a Consolidating Market

Here's where the **Sick Sister approach** occurs and how to use it with any consolidating Market:

*   If this one's weak, we're going to wait for this one to drop down into a **deep discount**.

### Fibonacci Retracement Analysis

*   From this low up to this high, here are your **optimal trade entry levels** here and here's equilibrium.
*   So it trades down below here and then goes into the **order block**, which is the consecutive down closed candles the black ones and then we have a **fair value Gap** here so there's your discount.
*   If you look at this High here in this High here that's by side resting here and I don't need to go all the way up to here to find a profitable trade
*   I can be buying in this fair value Gap inside of the order block below equilibrium inside of optimal trade entry these two respective levels here 62 and 79 on the Fib.
*   So I'm gonna look to buy in a discount, and you can see that is the case here right there.
*   I accumulated the position inside the order block, inside the fair value Gap, inside of a deep discount, aiming for the buy side above this High here and the buy side about here and I'll put one right between the two of them here here in there.

### Trade Execution and Exit

*   That price run here I did not need it to go up to here even though it was likely to do so I got out above here because I knew that once it takes out the Spy side it could want to rejoin what has been seen in the es and the doubt.

## Comparing Highs and Market Behavior

*   Let's go back to those at these highs here at this specific high, look how much more it dropped off on ES and the Dow.
*   So yes, they all three dropped. NASDAQ did not have the ability to get back above this old high, whereas the ES was, the Dow was, the Dow was also. It will give up its high here at 2:30. The previous trading session ES was not willing to do so.
*   So one of two highs were taken out on ES, two of both highs were taken out on the Dow, neither high was taken out on NASDAQ.

### Sick Sister in Action

*   That's the Sick Sister, and we're in consolidation.
*   That means it's likely to drop down to a discount and then rallied to go back above the buy side, whereas Dow was able to do so.
*   I don't need ES to do so, and it's already went lower anyway.

### Using Sick Sister in a Consolidating Market

*   Using the Sick Sister in a consolidation Market means we're looking for the one that failed to make a higher high or lower low, which is like typical SMT.
*   But the Sick Sister approach or concept that I'm using is that it's going to try to do it later on, and you want to put your focus on the weakest one.

## "First One Now Shall Later Be Last"

*   Well, the Bible says so, first one now shall later be last.
*   This one couldn't even muster up enough momentum to climb higher, whereas the ES did get a little bit higher, but the NASDAQ ramped all the way back up into the buy side here.

## Contrasting Trending and Consolidating Markets

### Trending Market Scenario

*   In trending markets, where we'll see opportunities, like for instance, say this was a trending Market not consolidation, whenever I see this Divergence here, and the ES and the Dow has made higher highs, but I don't believe it's reversing or even likely to have a meaningful retracement, I would expect this Market to resume and go higher.

### Consolidating Market Confirmation

*   But because the Sick Sister approached while in consolidation, which is exactly what I mentioned this morning, because we had the converging new week opening gaps, whenever you have converging new weak opening gas or real close to one another, the Market's going to be real likely to consolidate and go sideways.
*   Add to it the economic calendar that we had today, which was anemic it didn't have any medium or high impact news drivers for today, so we had a lot of factors leaning on this Market being as we see here consolidation.
*   At two o'clock in the afternoon it did trade back down into an **order block** which is here, so at two o'clock there it rallies up and then bumps the buy side there.

## Caution and Key Levels

*   But notice right above these highs, once it did that, it had a strong drop down, and you have to be careful with that because it can leave that high untouched.
*   It was this highs right here is what I was really focusing on and factoring that Sick Sister concept waiting for a discount.

## Importance of Buying at a Discount

*   We don't just simply Buy in here because it's going up here. I've seen some people reacting to the Tweet thinking that they understood me what they did not understand me when we're buying we're trying to buy at a discount.
*   So how are you rallied up so it needs to drop down and we see it going down into the opening session and then you wait for that typical opening range 30 minutes.
*   But here when it's dropping down we're inside the 30 minute range because it's trading into a deep discount, it's inside the fair value Gap, it's inside the order Block, it's below equilibrium, and it's done.
*   Oh a handsome job of getting down into a cheap discount price with PD arrays that are lining up with a potential long.

## Targeting Buy Side Liquidity

*   The run out the buy side here, and then eventually here in the afternoon, the PM session.

## Future Lessons and Refinements

*   I have more to teach about the Sick Sister concept.
*   I'll teach you more refine lessons with the successor it'll have its own presentation.
*   But I just want to kind of give you a review today and draw the parallels and the oppositions to what is classically seen as my SMT.
*   It it's similar but the approach to using the divergences and the later discount or later premium how you use the information is is starkly different.

## Conclusion

Hopefully, you found this one on cycle so I'll talk to you next time be safe.

# **ICT Silver Bullet Trade Setup: A Time-Based Algorithmic Trading Model**

## **Introduction**

Welcome back! This presentation will cover my ICT Silver Bullet trade setup, a time-based algorithmic trading model applicable to all asset classes. We will also discuss the relationship between **ticks, points, and pips** in the context of Forex and futures trading, specifically within the ICT Silver Bullet framework.

### **Ticks, Points, and Pips in Relation to ICT Silver Bullet Trades**

*   **Minimum Trade Framework:**
    *   **Index Futures (Indices):** 10 points or 40 ticks
    *   **Forex Pairs:** 15 pips

*   **Amplification:**
    *   This framework represents the *best-case* price delivery expected, **not** the actual trade entry-to-exit range.
    *   The goal is *not* to achieve perfect entry and exit precision, but rather to identify a trade within this framework that allows for more forgiving entry and exit points.
    *   With experience, entry and exit precision will improve.

### **Equivalencies Between Indices and Forex**

*   10 handles (points) in indices = 20 pips in Forex
*   5 handles (points) in indices = 10 pips in Forex

### **Essential Frameworks for High-Probability ICT Silver Bullet Setups**

The above equivalencies are essential to the setups.

### **Addressing Common Questions**

Many people reach out via TradingView with questions. The question that keeps popping up recently is: if I'm looking for 5 handles of price movement in the E-mini S&P, what would that translate to for those trading Forex? That would be the equivalent of 10 pips. If I'm looking for 10 Handles in indices or trading stock index futures, if you're a Forex Trader you would be looking for the equivalent of 20 pips in your Forex pair.

## **Types of ICT Silver Bullet Setups**

The framework for many ICT Silver Bullet setups are as follows, but they're not limited to:

1.  **Previous Day High or Low as a Draw on Liquidity:**
    *   **Bullish:** Look for a run to the previous day's high (buy-side liquidity).
    *   **Bearish:** Look for a run to the previous day's low (sell-side liquidity).

2.  **Previous Session Highs and Lows as Draws on Liquidity:**
    *   For example, during the New York AM session, analyze the high and low of the preceding London session.

3.  **Previous Weekly High or Low as a Draw on Liquidity:**
    *   **Bullish:** Aim for a run above the previous week's high.
    *   **Bearish:** Aim for a run below the previous week's low.

4.  **Returning to a Current or Old New Week Opening Gap:**
    *   This can act as a draw on liquidity, or an expansion away from it.

5.  **Classic ICT Optimal Trade Entry (OTE):**
    *   While historically the flagship pattern, the fair value gap has arguably taken precedence.

6.  **Confluence of the 2022 ICT Mentorship YouTube Model:**
    *   **Bullish:** Aiming for an inefficiency (sell-side imbalance buy-side inefficiency/fair value gap) *above* current price action.
    *   **Bearish:** Aiming for an inefficiency (buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency/fair value gap) *below* current price action.

7.  **All the Above are Equally Available in Terms of Probability:**
    *   Not all factors will be present at any given time. For example, if the previous week's high has already been reached, look to a higher timeframe liquidity pool or inefficiency.

**Key Emphasis:** Determining the next most likely draw on price action is the number one goal. Where is price most likely to go to next? This skill set is paramount because entries and exits are secondary; without knowing where price is heading, any analytical approach is likely to fail.

## **ICT Silver Bullet Setups: Time-Based Models**

This model is time-based; setups are linked to specific 60-minute intervals/windows each trading day.

### **Setup #1: London Open Silver Bullet (3:00 AM - 4:00 AM New York Local Time)**

*   **Time:** 3:00 AM - 4:00 AM New York Local Time.
    *   *Note:* All times are referenced to New York local time. Adjust charts accordingly, including for daylight savings.
*   **Formation:** Classic ICT Fair Value Gap forming between 3:00 AM and 4:00 AM.
*   **Focus:** Identifying the next draw on liquidity (buy stops above the market or trading into inefficiency above current price action if bullish, or the opposite if bearish).
*   **Example:**

    *   Market was bearish, targeting a sell-side liquidity pool below an old swing low.
    *   A fair value gap formed between 3:00 AM and 4:00 AM.
    *   A shift in market structure occurred below a low.
    *   The market demonstrates a willingness to support this idea, with candle bodies staying inside the gap.

*   **Execution:**

    *   Shorting inside the fair value gap formed during the 3:00 AM - 4:00 AM window.
    *   **Not** an in-and-out trade within the same 60-minute window; trades may extend into the 5:00 AM hour or even the New York session opening at 7:00 AM or 8:00 AM.
    *   Target the old low and sell-side liquidity below it.
    *   The Framework was if it could get to 10 handles. We don't require it.
*   **Minimum Framework Requirement:** The asset must offer the potential for 10 handles for futures or indices or 15 pips for forex.
*   **Cameron's Model:** This is my actual model for my son Cameron.

### **Setup #2: AM Session Silver Bullet (10:00 AM - 11:00 AM New York Local Time)**

*   **Time:** 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM New York Local Time.
*   **Formation:** Bearish fair value gap.

*   **Example:**
    * We wait for when the Market's bearish relative equal lows they sell side resting below that.
    * The E-mini S&P is used as an example.
    *   When the market trades up into the gap between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM, consider selling short.
    * The market trades up into it between 10:00 and 11 o'clock we can sell short there.

*   **Framework:** From 4146 to 4136, is it a minimum of 10 handles in framework? It does not mean you're trying to get 10 handles it just means that it offers 10 handles.
*   **Execution:**

    * Going short here collecting five handles that could have been done inside of the scope of that 60-minute window.
    *   Not an in-and-out trade within the same hour; look for the setup to form to get into the trade within the 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM window.

### **Setup #3: PM Session Silver Bullet (2:00 PM - 3:00 PM New York Local Time)**

*   **Time:** 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM New York Local Time.
*   **Formation:**

    *   The market trades down into a higher timeframe (15-minute) discount fair value gap.
    *   Encouragement to verify the existence of this gap.
    *   A swing has been broken to the upside, indicating a shift in market structure.

*   **Example:**

    *   Rally into 2:00 PM, creating a small fair value gap.
    *   The market drops into that gap before taking out relative equal highs (buy-side liquidity).
    *   Returning back to a premium sell-side imbalance buy-side inefficiency or fair value gap that would be above the market here and here.

*   **Execution:**
    * From entry all the way up, does this offer 10 handles?
    * The framework could be on the optimal trade entry here and taking the first fair value gap that forms inside of and reprices to between 2:00 and 3:00.
    * This happens right there.
    *   Taking the first fair value gap that forms and reprices to between 2:00 PM and 3:00 PM.
    *   This is a high-probability condition, favorable for a run into inefficiency in the premium and taking out buy-side liquidity.

## **Closing Thoughts**

*   **Backtesting is Crucial:** If new to the channel, backtest this pattern while learning to reprice action and determine the next draw on liquidity.
*   **Pattern Validity:** These patterns consistently form. I have called out a few of them in real time on Twitter.
*   **Rule-Based and Time-Based:** This model provides a rule-based approach that utilizes both time and price.
*   **Repetitive Nature:** Emphasizing the specific 60-minute window of opportunity that forms *every* trading day.
*   **Focus on Specialization:** Ideally, follow only one or two markets initially. Over time, specialize in a single market.
*   **One Market is Enough:** If you can follow one market, you can get your setups there, you can make your bread and butter, you can make your ends meet.
*   **Discipline and Patience:** A setup will form every single trading day, either in London, the AM session, or the PM session.
*   **Independence and Trust:** The goal is for you to become independently minded, trust your own analysis, and not rely on external sources.
*   **Empowerment:** This approach empowers you and fosters a sense of self-reliance.

Okay, here's the structured and refined version of the provided text, focusing on clarity, organization, and detail preservation:

# E-mini S&P (ES) and NASDAQ Futures Analysis (June 2023)

**Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiv8pkcNvGk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiv8pkcNvGk)

This review incorporates elements from the 2022-2023 mentorship program. It focuses on the E-mini S&P 500 (ES) delivery contract for June 2023, along with insights from the NASDAQ futures contract.

## Weekly Chart Analysis (ES - June 2023 Delivery)

*   **Area of Focus:** The analysis highlights an area of interest at the top of the weekly chart. This area aligns with similar observations in the NASDAQ futures contract.
*   **NASDAQ Confirmation:** The NASDAQ has already delivered its respective volume and bounce in the same zone.
*   **ES Target:** The speaker believes that ES is likely to move up into this area based on technical analysis.
*   **Buy-Side Liquidity:** The speaker has favored a run on buy-side liquidity, as mentioned on Twitter.

## Technical Rationale for Bullish Bias

*   **Discount Fair Value Gap:**
    *   A discount fair value gap exists between the high of one candle and the low of another.
    *   This area has been delivered twice.
*   **Consolidation:** The market is consolidating with a weekly imbalance, supported by the volume and bounce.
*   **Buy-Side Target:** Buy-side liquidity is a likely target.
*   **Powell's Speech:** Fed Chair Powell's speech on Friday at 10 AM EST is a key event to watch. It is anticipated that the market is pausing in anticipation of the Federal Reserve (FED) chair. The markets will likely use the information from the Fed to make the next move.
*   **Down-Closed Candle:**
    *   Analysis includes a down-closed candle on the weekly chart.
    *   The opening price is used as the reference point (instead of the high) due to the short candle wick. This is only used if the candle wick is small in respect to the entire range of the candle.

## Projected Market Movement

*   **Weekly Candle Expansion:** Expectation for the weekly candle to expand upwards.
*   **Targets:** Potential targets include reaching the high and then the weekly volume imbalance.
*   **Timeframe:** The speaker is looking for Thursday and Friday to deliver this upward movement, mirroring NASDAQ's performance.

## Key Levels and Considerations

*   **Blue Shaded Area (Order Block):** Be mindful of the blue shaded area representing an order block.
    *   These levels will transpose onto daily charts.
*   **Weekly Order Block Level:** The Weekly order block level is a key level to watch.
*   **Weekly Discount Fair Value Gap:** The shaded area represents the weekly discount fair value gap.
*   **Wicks on Weekly Chart:** The speaker mentioned two candles trading as wicks on the weekly chart, which are evident on the daily candles.
*   **Twitter Video Vignette:** Earlier in the week, the speaker shared a short video on Twitter about an imbalance, which is a fair value gap between a candle's high and another candle's low. This section of price action is a fair value gap in the form of a buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency (BISI). The market has largely remained within this gap and reached up into a premium fair value gap.
*   **Relative Equal Highs:** Annotated on the chart are relative equal highs, residing within the weekly volume imbalance.
*   **Target Price:** Specifically, the 4244 level is favored as a potential draw.
*   **Disclaimer:** This level may not be reached this week.
*   **Immediate Target:** Belief that the market will likely reach up into the high sometime this week before closing. Whether it stays there or moves higher is uncertain.
*   **Current Stance:** Currently treating the aforementioned high as a draw on liquidity.

## Color-Coded Levels

*   The light blue and pink levels will be visible on lower timeframes. These levels will not be shown on subsequent slides.

## Buy-Side Liquidity & Market Dynamics

*   **Buy-Side Liquidity Pool:** There's a buy-side liquidity pull-up near the daily premium fair value gap, the daily discount fair value gap, and the weekly discount fair value gap. This provides context for focusing on buy-side targets.
*   **Tweet Mention:** The buy-side liquidity outlined on these highs was mentioned in a tweet.
*   **Stacked Liquidity:** The speaker notes that there hasn't been significant liquidity runs. Which means liquidity has been building (stacked).
*   **Offset Distribution:** Every time the market moved lower, the existing liquidity has been utilized as a means of offset distribution.
*   **Offsets:** Offsetting the longs that were accumulated at previous lows.

## Daily Chart Analysis: Gradient Levels of Fair Value Gap

*   **Gradient Levels:** Dashed and dotted lines represent gradient levels of the fair value gap on the daily chart.
*   **Midpoint:** The dotted red line marks the midpoint (consequent encroachment).
*   **Quartiles:** The lower and upper 25% levels are marked, along with the high and low of the fair value gap.
*   **Transposition:** This relates to the area shown in the previous slide. When doing this analysis on your own charts, the intention is for you to see how these levels transpose.
*   **Important Disclaimer:** This is *not* Quarters Theory. Rectangles are merely used to highlight areas for personal study. Despite drawing rectangles, this is not supply and demand trading.
*   **Algorithm Interaction:** The algorithm seeks these levels of inefficiencies (fair value gaps) and interacts with them precisely.
*   **Market Reaction:** Observed market reactions around these levels (body of the candle).
*   **Current Market Condition:** The market rallied today into the premium fair value gap on the daily chart and is currently consolidating. The market could come back down a little bit, then reprice up into the 4200s.

## Short-Term Outlook (Ahead of Powell's Speech)

*   **Powell's Potential Impact:** Fed Chair Powell's speech on Friday could inject volatility into the market.
*   **Focus:** Disregarding the "dynamite" brought by Powell's words, it is important to assess where the market has been, what it's reacting to, and where it's likely to go next.
*   **Fair Value Gap (BISI):**
    *   Looking at a small fair value gap defined by a candle's low and another's high.
    *   This represents a buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency (BISI).
*   **Efficient Repricing:** Market needs to reprice that, efficiently rebalancing that area.
*   **Price Delivery:** Efficient price delivery involves moving above and below (or below and above) a key area.
*   **Buy-Side Imbalance:** Looking back into the area, there's a buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency (BISI)
*   **Level Respect:** The market also seems to respect this gap.
*   **Chart Note:** Going forward, these levels will not specifically remain on the chart. However, you should keep them on your personal charts.

## Refinement on 15-Minute Timeframe

*   Dropping down into a 15-minute timeframe reveals how the market has respected the gradient levels on the fair value gap.
*   **Fib Tool:** Use a Fibonacci retracement tool on the high and low of any fair value gap (or gap of any kind).
*   **Fib Levels:** Highlight the 50%, 25%, and 75% levels on your Fibonacci retracement tool settings.
*   **Implementation:** By drawing a range from high to low (or low to high), these levels will appear accordingly.
*   Further detail on this process will be provided during the summer months.

## Backtesting Methodology: Annotation and Journaling

*   **Market Open:** The market drops at the opening bell. This is a key area to examine further.
*   **Refining:** By doing this presentation, the speaker is further refining these processes to a level of precision.
*   **Student Guidance:** The speaker directs students to go back to old data and backtest. This is a backtesting method that uses chart annotation. This is not done using Forex Tester or Market Replay.
*   **Backtesting vs Forward Testing:** Using the former tools is a type of forward testing before diving into live data.
*   **Essential Practice:** All of the tools have their place, but it is more essential to study price action to a high degree of detail by annotating your charts, like shown here. This answers requests for how to backtest.
*   **Process:** Create individual slides like this to give an idea.
*   **Journaling Styles:** Acknowledgment that there are various ways to journal, none inherently superior.
*   **Personal Comfort:** Suggestion to choose a method that is most comfortable for the individual.
*   **Therapeutic Approach:** Encourage making the process like therapy or a hobby, delving deeply into old data.
*   **Key Information:** Study the delivery details, how it delivered, and what time it delivered.
*   **Subconscious Retention:** Through months and years of backtesting and studying price action like this, your subconscious retains that information.
*   **Pseudo Experience:** Seeing the same patterns repeatedly creates a "pseudo-experience."
*   **Annotations:** In the empty areas of the charts, add annotations that mention seeing these things coming before they happened. Retaining that on your charts along with your annotations, and reviewing that on the weekend will positively reinforce your mind.
*   **Positive Reinforcement:** Refrain from adding negative statements about failures or missed opportunities. Instead, focus on positive reinforcement through cheerleading and annotations.
*   **Mind Training:** This trains the mind to not be fearful of market moves.
*   **Pattern Recognition:** It helps to recognize patterns based on this process.

## Lower Timeframe Analysis

*   **5-Minute Chart:** Transition to a 5-minute chart to observe how the market respects the midpoint (consequent encroachment) of the daily discount fair value gap.
*   **Disclaimer:** Recognizes that newer students may find this overwhelming. With time, these patterns will become more apparent on your own charts. The intent here is to conceptually show how the market respected the levels, and to what degree of precision.
*   **3-Minute Chart:** The 3-minute timeframe is a focal point in student training, derived from 15-minute and 5-minute charts to refine imbalances.
*   **ICT Silver Bullet:** Recent teaching emphasis on the ICT Silver Bullet setup.
*   **Twitter Space:** Mentions a previous Twitter space that introduced this concept in audio format.
*   **Recent Video:** Directs viewers to a video posted prior to this one for more detailed information on this time-based algorithmic setup.
*   **Morning Session Focus:** The analysis concentrates on the morning session Silver Bullet.
*   **PM Session Example:** In passing, there is an example of a PM session at the top of the chart.
*   **Shift in Structure:** There's a shift in market structure, trading back into the fair value gap and dropping to attack sell-side liquidity. This can be used for study notes for the PM session Silver Bullet.
*   **Prior Day Prediction:** The speaker said they wanted to see higher prices on the ES to catch up with the NASDAQ and also sent out a tweet with the chart showing buy-side liquidity.
*   **Refined Details:** Using that along with previous material, the speaker dives into a deeper level of detail.
*   **Judas Swing:** At 9:30, the market drops. This is the "Judas Swing".
*   **Clear Short-Term Low:** The Judas Swing clears out a short-term low. This particular move is looked at in great detail later on.
*   **Shift in Market Structure:** There is a shift in market structure around a short-term swing high.
*   **Fair Value Gap:** The fair value gap occurs between 10:00 and 11:00.
*   **Bullish Scenario:** Market drops, then trades into a fair value gap. This is the Silver Bullet long.
*   **Long Entry:** Buying near the low of the candle.
*   **Reward:** Moving from 4130 to 4140 is approximately 10 handles, and the market has yet to meet the high, which is at 4144.
*   **Criteria:** Meets the Silver Bullet criteria to run to buy-side.
*   **Profit Taking:** Teaching Cameron to take profits at five handles.
*   **Buy-Side Hit:** When buy-side is hit, the market comes back down and takes out the sell-side.
*   **Run-On Stops:** Market offers a "run-on stops". Smart money uses this opportunity to accumulate new longs while trailed stops are taken out.
*   **Daily Discount:** The market is trading back into the daily discount fair value gap, more specifically the upper quadrant of the 75% range.
*   **Imbalance Consideration:** The market is only offered downside delivery to efficiently rebook and balance. When the market moves higher, the individuals may see this as a liquidity void, and believe that the fair value gap is balanced. It is not yet balanced; it has only rebooked and repriced inefficiency.
*   **Balanced Range Confirmation:** When the market trades down to the low and leaves the range, it then becomes a balanced price range. This is because price has been delivered to the upside and failed to go lower, respected it, and left the range. This acts as a trading range inside this micro imbalance.
*   **Precise Candle Relationship:** This candle's high is precisely this candle's low.
*   **Validation:** Verify that it is in fact true using your own charts.
*   **Future Outlook:** If we start to move higher, then we have probably made the low of the day. Further details are provided later on.

## 1-Minute Chart Analysis: Precision & Balance

*   **Balanced Price Range:** Observing the range between 10 AM and 11 AM New York local time.
*   **Trading View: Electronic Trading Hours:** The general appearance of electronic trading hours highlighted.
*   **Switching to Regular Trading Hours:** On Trading View, when having live data, you can toggle between Electronic Trading Hours and Regular Trading Hours to see more detail.
*   **Toggling:** If you select it, then it switches to an option between Regular Trading Hours and Electronic Trading Hours.

Okay, here is the text, meticulously restructured and refined to enhance readability and organization, while preserving every detail, nuance, and the original tone.

# Deeper Dive into Market Mechanics & Backtesting (ICT Concepts)

## Opening Range Gap Analysis & Application

*   Switching to **Regular Trading Hours (RTH)** on Trading View displays the Opening Range Gap.
*   **Opening Range Gap Definition:** The opening range gap is defined as the gap between the previous session's closing price and the opening price at 9:30 AM New York time.
*   This concept has been taught to charter members and older **ICT mentorship students** since 1996.
*   While the speaker does not claim ownership of the concept, he wants to highlight how this gap should be used.

### How to Interpret Opening Range Gaps:

*   **Bullish Scenario:** If there is a gap higher and the market is bullish, expect the price to trade down to fill the gap, reprice, and then move higher, away from the gap's direction.
*   **Bearish Scenario:** If there is a gap lower and the market is bearish, the price could trade lower to fill the gap, potentially with a false run, and then break lower.
*   **Consolidation Scenario:** If the market is in consolidation and has already met a higher timeframe (weekly) objective with a gap higher, the gap might fill, but the market may simply use the entire gap throughout the day with no further directional move.

### Current Market Context (Bullish):

*   Yesterday's bullish bias implies a gap higher opening, which fills and reprices down into the **Opening Range Gap low.**
*   The session closes on **Regular Trading Hours (RTH)** the previous day.
*   You can locate that price by toggling from Electronic Trading Hours to Regular Trading Hours.
*   The difference between where the market traded at settlement yesterday and the 9:30 AM opening bell in New York is hidden. This difference is the gap, which can be higher, lower, or unchanged.
*   A gap indicates an inefficiency, which often (but not always) reprices to.

### ICT's Unique Application of Opening Range Gaps:

*   Once the gap is completely repriced, if the market is bullish, you can multiply the range of that gap and project it higher.
*   Taking the range from the low to the high and multiplying it can yield two standard deviations, which closely aligns with the high without needing the premium fair value gap (pink area).

### Additional Context & Twitter References:

*   The speaker mentioned this on Twitter beforehand and referenced short vignettes on imbalances and trading ranges.
*   Students are encouraged to review past tweets and chart annotations.

## Power 3, Daily Range & Confluences

*   In terms of the speaker's Power 3 concept, the daily range opens at 9:30 AM, trades down (a Judas Swing), and then moves higher.
*   **Judas Swing:** Retail traders chase the move lower because they are unaware of the inefficiency between electronic trading hours and how they're hidden.
*   The opening bell volatility often seeks to reprice to the previous session's close.
*   **Bullish Confirmation:** Once the market moves meaningfully above the opening price, it typically starts to run higher towards a premium (the premium fair value gap shaded in pink).
*   The video takes the viewer from a higher timeframe down to a lower timeframe to clarify the analysis.
*   **Power 3 Components:** The Power 3 concepts are: Open, Manipulation (Judas Swing), Accumulation of longs, Distribution into a premium, and then settlement day close.
*   **Daily Range Alignment:** The daily range is a classic ICT buy day, featuring a Judas Swing to reprice the opening range gap low.

### Confluence Examples:

*   Daily fair value gap consequent encroachment.
*   The midpoint of the daily discount fair value gap aligns with the New Day Opening Gap (as shown in a previous YouTube video presentation).
*   Many factors confluenced at the low of the day.
*   A trader using retail logic would not be able to see all these confluences.

### Draw to Buy-Side Liquidity:

*   A draw to buy-side liquidity was shown on Twitter on May 16th, 2023.
*   The high of the day was booked at the daily premium fair value gap high.

### Algorithmic Price Action Summary:

*   These details form a tapestry showing how the algorithm prices, reprices, redelivers, balances, and seeks new liquidity.
*   Traders using ICT concepts aim to anticipate the algorithm's actions.
*   Anticipate if the algorithm will move higher to an inefficiency or to take out buy stops.
*   Anticipate if the algorithm will move lower to an inefficiency or to take out sell stops.
*   If neither of those scenarios is likely, the market will likely consolidate in a range-bound manner.

## Detailed Backtesting Procedures

*   Backtesting involves using these annotated areas.
*   The speaker encourages cheerleading and documenting observations.
*   Note how the market respects the Silver Bullet setup (fair value gap on the 3-minute timeframe).
*   Even though the current chart being viewed is the 1-minute chart, all annotations from the 3-minute chart are transposed onto it.
*   Include everything seen and observed for richer journal entries.

### Structuring Your Trading Journal

*   Avoid generic scribbles and useless information.
*   Treat journaling like a meditation.
*   Organize charts so they mean something specific to you.
*   Create a trading manual using your own eyes, experience, annotations, charting, and snapshots of individual charts and timeframes.
*   This is the best trading book, journal, or instructional manual on price action.
*   It takes time (months) and effort to be organized.
*   The more work put in, the better you will become at reading price action.
*   Every profitable student engaged in these types of detailed studies.

### Key Elements of Backtesting:

*   Review old moves.
*   Study the details.
*   Note what time certain events occurred.
*   Note what time the market repriced to the high or low of the day.
*   Study that from a higher timeframe.
*   Maintain a bias.
*   Consider why price should move to a higher or lower level.
*   Review charts with that mindset.
*   Note all opportunities presented.
*   Over time, you'll develop a rich understanding of price action from old hindsight moves that will be applicable to future price action.

### Practical Applications & Analogies:

*   Every technical study (doctors, technicians) involves practicing on case studies that are already completed.
*   Surgeons practice on cadavers (dead bodies donated for scientific study) to study anatomy and perform surgeries without risk.
*   There's no risk to backtesting.

### Avoiding Negative Reinforcement

*   Don't include negative affirmations in annotations (e.g., "I was stupid," "I missed this," "This doesn't work").
*   Cheerlead yourself in your annotations.
*   Extract information found in old price moves.
*   Map out each individual day as the speaker did.
*   Focus intently on one market (or two closely correlated ones).
*   Spend your time and energy studying one instrument or pair deeply.
*   The same principles apply to Forex, commodities, and futures.
*   The speaker will talk to you next time and advises you to be safe.

# **Post Analysis Review: A Deep Dive into Market Movements**

## **Introduction**

Alright folks, welcome back. This is a quick review of post-market analysis, building upon yesterday evening's breakdown of email SMP and outlining expectations for Thursday and Friday.
Video URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeZlyG8FZLQ

## **Recap of Previous Analysis**

*   A chart was presented in the previous recording (available on YouTube with a timestamp).
*   The analysis anticipated price drawing above the buy-side and into an old weekly imbalance.
*   Today's market action fulfilled this expectation.
*   The weekly candlestick expanded as predicted.
*   Buy-side liquidity above the high was taken.
*   Price traded within the designated volume imbalance.

## **Addressing Continuous Contract Usage (TradingView)**

*   Question arose about why the continuous contract isn't used on TradingView.
*   Reason: Continuous contracts **do not accurately display inefficiencies** visible on individual delivery contract months.
*   For example: Observing price exceeding a specific high.
*   The speaker favors a particular City and volume imbalance, contingent on price action continuation.
*   The benefit lies in having a thinly-traded contract that was active before becoming the front month.
*   The current contract being traded is the June contract, displayed on a weekly chart.
*   Compressing a continuous chart into a weekly candlestick chart **obscures inefficiencies**.
*   **Time-based charts offer a built-in advantage** by revealing these otherwise hidden market dynamics.
*   Assertion that Time-based charts are essential for understanding price movements because the algorithm works on **time first**; **Time and Price Theory**.

## **Daily Chart Review & Market Expectations**

*   The daily chart from the previous evening was re-utilized for this review.
*   Today's market saw delivery to the buy-side, drawing into the weekly volume imbalance.
*   The approach focuses on **simple ideas**: identifying the next likely draw for price.
*   The analysis is built from weekly charts, cascading down to daily, hourly, 15-minute, 5-minute, and 1-minute charts.

## **Guidance for Aspiring Traders**

*   The initial goal for learners is to develop the ability to **predict where price will draw to next**.
*   This mentorship aims to lend experience to facilitate effective price action study.
*   The core focus should be on journaling and analyzing historical data to identify **recurring patterns**.
*   Once these patterns are recognized and understood, they become ingrained and impossible to ignore.

## **The "Cult of Winning"**

*   The community is jokingly referred to as a "cult," which is embraced as the "cult of winning".
*   Emphasis on the **transparency of the analysis**: predictions made before market movements.
*   No ability to manipulate daily or weekly candlesticks to fit a narrative.

## **Detailed Price Action Analysis**

*   This week's price action examined in detail.
*   Gradients were removed from the chart, and the focus is on key turning points.
*   **Arrow placement on charts** during journaling exercises is encouraged to train the eye to recognize key price levels.
*   Future execution practice will benefit from this pattern recognition.

## **Fair Value Gaps and Institutional Order Flow**

*   Expectation set for price to draw up into a specific fair value gap, buy-side liquidity, and the weekly volume imbalance.
*   While consolidating, price was anticipated to draw down into a specific buy-side imbalance before moving higher.
*   This move was executed.
*   **Institutional Order Flow Entry Drill (IOFED)**: a partial entry into a fair value gap (either buy-side or sell-side imbalance).
*   IOFED is an abbreviation of Institutional Order Flow Enter Drill
*   The featured example is a buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency (BISI).
*   Fair value gaps are classified within a Price Delivery Array (PDA), further categorized based on characteristics.
*   In a bullish market, the expectation is for price to briefly enter this area before continuing upward.
*   The market dropped slightly into the candle's low and then rallied.

## **Daily Chart Dynamics**

*   Another buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency (BISI) created.
*   A breaker pattern identified.
*   Price trades down into both the breaker and the consequent encouragement of the daily fair value gap.
*   The optimal trade entry (OTE) occurs when price returns to touch and reprice the candle's high.
*   Once this high is traded above, the area becomes a balanced price range.
*   The market is expected to continue higher, targeting buy-side liquidity and the weekly volume imbalance.

## **15-Minute Chart & Judas Swing**

*   Dropping to a 15-minute chart reveals an **IOFED** pattern.
*   A "Judas Swing" occurs in the morning session, defined as a **fake move**.
*   The Judas Swing rallies up, creating a three-drive pattern.
*   The speaker executed two trades during this time.
*   The market then dropped into a fair value gap before rallying again.
*   Engagement in the afternoon session involved a "Silver Bullet" trade.

## **Morning Session Details**

*   Three drives pattern: 1, 2, 3.
*   Institutional order flow entry drill down after taking sell-side liquidity.
*   Rally ensues.
*   Short-term reversal pattern emerges.
*   While indicative of a possible retracement, the **unfinished business** of the weekly imbalance suggests further upside.
*   **NASDAQ** is identified as a leader on the upside.

## **The "Six Sisters" Concept**

*   The "Six Sisters" concept is applied: trading the pair that has lagged behind (ES) in expectation of catching up to NASDAQ.
*   NASDAQ trades were also executed.

## **Afternoon Session & Market on Close Macro**

*   A breaker pattern forms: high, low, higher high.
*   A retracement occurs, clearing out sell-side liquidity.
*   Entry into the New York PM session (2:00 PM - 4:00 PM) sees fair value gaps form.
*   The **Market on Close (MOC) macro** (3:15 PM - 3:45 PM) is briefly mentioned. More detailed explanation will be provided in future books.

## **Book Announcement & Community Challenge**

*   Four books are planned: Three technical books covering algorithmic theory and the speaker's concepts. The fourth will be fiction.
*   Release of book one is contingent on reaching 1 million subscribers on YouTube.
*   Delay in publishing is due to concerns about others prematurely publishing incomplete versions of these concepts.

## **One-Minute Chart Analysis**

*   Imbalance refined into a fair value gap.
*   Price drops, clearing relative equal lows before the rally.
*   Three drives pattern is re-examined, featuring a consequent encouragement of the imbalance.
*   Partial executions were taken, with stops initially hit before re-entry and further partials.

## **Breaker Pattern & Lunchtime Dynamics**

*   The market breaks down, forming a breaker pattern.
*   A higher structure breaker is identified: a low with a high to the left and a higher high to the right.
*   The speaker clarifies: when this low is broken, you have high, low, higher high.
*   A fair value gap trades up into this breaker, also an optimal trade entry into a shorter block.
*   Delivery speeds down to an old imbalance.
*   Consolidation follows, which is expected during New York lunch (Noon-1pm New York Local Time).
*   This entices traders to view the area as support.
*   The level becomes a target for sell-side liquidity, resulting in a stop hunt during the New York lunch hour.
*   Run on the breaker down into a fair value gap, is also an Institutional Order Flow Entry Drill.
*   The market rallies, consolidates, and rips higher, targeting buy-side liquidity, the old buy-side liquidity pool, and the weekly volume imbalance.

## **PM Session Silver Bullet & Market on Close**

*   A quick run occurs during the PM session (2:00 PM - 4:00 PM New York Local Time).
*   The PM session Silver Bullet setup is used.
*   The Market on Close (MOC) macro presents another opportunity to target unmanaged liquidity.
*   The market fills the numbers, targeting buy-side liquidity and the weekly volume imbalance.

## **Reclamation & Power 3**

*   A Silver Bullet setup is used.
*   A reclaiming fair value gap is highlighted.
*   Price trades back down into this inefficiency.
*   It only needs to go down to this fair value gap to reprice this candle, then rallies again.
*   This example demonstrates the "Power 3" concept.

## **Daily Candlestick Structure**

*   The daily candlestick opened with a small movement lower, followed by a rally that created a high.
*   The speaker intends to elaborate on the high of the day (HOD) in the future.


### **Post Analysis Review: A Deep Dive into Market Movements (Continuation)**

#### **By Day Open Decline and Fair Value Gap**

The market exhibited a classic "by day open decline due to swing rallies up," ultimately closing on the high. This price action effectively traded within the fair value gap. The 9:30 AM opening was positioned near the low of that specific fair value gap, which was shaded for emphasis.

*   **Opening Range Gap:** This refers to the difference between the previous day's close and the 9:30 AM open (Regular Trading Hours).
*   The speaker hinted at a concept related to this gap that will be elaborated on in an upcoming book.

#### **Protecting Intellectual Property**

The speaker expressed reluctance to share certain concepts due to concerns about others profiting from them without proper credit. They intend to publish these insights in a book to establish clear ownership and recognition.

*   The speaker referenced the appropriation of their concepts by individuals creating mentorship programs without acknowledgment.
*   The speaker aims to prevent others from rebranding their original work as their own discoveries or attributing it to obscure, unrelated sources.

#### **Amplifying Existing Concepts**

The speaker highlighted how they have enhanced existing trading concepts, such as the Central Bank Dealers Range and the Asian Range.

*   **Central Bank Dealers Range:** The speaker referenced applying projection techniques.
*   **Asian Range:** The speaker "supercharged" the understanding and application of the Asian Range, particularly through standard deviations.
*   The speaker suggests the Opening Range Gap can be similarly analyzed using standard deviation projections for higher price targets.

#### **Trade Execution Details**

The speaker detailed their trade execution, including the reasoning behind their exit point.

*   **Standard Deviation Overlap:** An overlap of negative 11 standard deviations projected a price level of 4214.75.
*   **Exit Point:** The speaker's exit was based on this 4214.75 level, with price slightly exceeding it to trade into the 4215s, which marked the high of the day.
*   Traders can refer to the speaker's Twitter account for execution details related to the PM session for ES and NASDAQ.

#### **PM Session Silver Bullet & Market on Close (MOC) Macro**

The speaker briefly discussed the PM session Silver Bullet setup and the Market on Close (MOC) macro.

*   **Market on Close (MOC) Macro:** In the final 15 minutes of trading (3:45 PM - 4:00 PM), the algorithm typically seeks liquidity.
*   If a higher time frame liquidity pool or target has been met, the algorithm may not aggressively run during this period, resulting in a smaller "sputter move".

#### **Review of Previous Day's Expectations**

The speaker recapped the expectations set in the previous night's analysis, emphasizing their accurate fulfillment.

*   **Targets:** The speaker had anticipated price moving towards 4206 and a 15-minute premium fair value gap, ultimately drawing into the weekly volume imbalance (the shaded area).
*   These expectations were accurately met.

#### **Rationale Behind Market Movements**

The speaker underscored the logical and non-random nature of market movements.

*   The speaker advocates for understanding *why* price moves in a particular way and *when* it is expected to do so.
*   This approach aims to move traders away from reliance on indicators and towards anticipating market behavior rather than reacting to it.

#### **Draw on Liquidity: The Key to Profitability**

The ability to predict the next "draw on liquidity" is presented as essential for profitable trading.

*   **Draw on Liquidity:** This refers to the next likely target for price movement.
*   Without consistently identifying these targets, profitability will remain elusive, regardless of the trading method used.

#### **Smart Money vs. Retail Traders**

The speaker contrasted the strategies of "smart money" with those of retail traders.

*   **Retail Traders' Logic:** Retail traders often perceive relative equal lows as "classic support" and place buy orders accordingly.
*   **Smart Money's Counter-Strategy:** Smart money exploits this by driving price down to trigger sell stops, acting as the counterparty to those orders and accumulating positions at a lower price.
*   Conversely, buy stops above old highs are targeted by smart money to distribute their long positions, selling to retail traders who are chasing the breakout.

#### **Selling Longs and Covering Shorts**

The speaker shared a key principle of smart money trading.

*   Smart money aims to sell long positions partially above old highs and cover short positions below old lows.

#### **Avoiding Retail Traps**

The speaker cautioned against relying on retail-oriented trading strategies.

*   **Retail Indicators:** Retail traders use moving averages and breakout strategies.
*   The algorithm often creates scenarios designed to trap retail traders employing such methods.
*   The speaker's goal is to help traders avoid being perpetual "neophytes" and to understand the true workings of the markets.

# Analyzing a Forex Trade: An Evolving ICT Silver Bullet Strategy

This document details a forex trading strategy, capturing the trader's thought process, adjustments, and execution in real-time. It's based on the ICT (Inner Circle Trader) "Silver Bullet" concept, with modifications and adaptations made during the trading session. The original content is based on the analysis of the video available at the following URL: **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkOuO0eNwUA**

## Initial Setup and Analysis (Pre-Trade)

*   **Objective:** Identify a "Silver Bullet" trading opportunity on the sell-side.
*   **Initial Plan:** Short the market, targeting the sell-side liquidity.
*   **Entry Point:** Aim for a limit order just above the current price. The trader initially places a limit order at 4206.
*   **Stop Loss:** Place the stop loss directly above the initial entry point around 4208.
*   **Contract Size:** Aim to build a position of 10 contracts.
*   **Key Levels:**
    *   Current news opening gap high.
    *   Consequent encouragement (midpoint of the opening gap).
    *   Fair value gap noted on the chart.

### Initial Concerns

*   The trader acknowledges a potential balanced price range due to a large range closed candle on the left of the chart.
*   There is a risk that the price may not re-enter the fair value gap.
*   A larger-than-desired stop loss (40 to 12 points) prevents immediate shorting at the preferred location.

## Evolving the Silver Bullet and Trade Adjustment

*   **Time Window:** The trading session is taking place within the ICT Silver Bullet time window (minutes after 10 AM).
*   **Price Action Observation:** The price taps into a low, a draw on liquidity.
*   **Revised Plan:** The trader anticipates a shallow drop below the low (one or two ticks), leaving a shaded area intact. This leads to anticipation that the price will then go back up.
*   **Adjusted Rectangle:** After observing price action, the trader adjusts the "Silver Bullet" rectangle down to a new area and will adjust the entry to match.

## The Evolving Silver Bullet

*   **Definition:** The initial Silver Bullet range evolves based on price action.
*   **Original Range:** Initially thought to be around the 4210 level.
*   **Adjusted Range:** Modified based on observed price movements and key levels.

*   **Aggressive vs. Conservative Approach:** The speaker acknowledges that one could use other highs, but it could fail on you. This particular high is preferred because it's the parent price swing that sent it down.
*   **Model 2022 Confirmation:** This confirms the 2022 Model.
*   **Fair Value Gap Rally:** The price rallies into a fair value gap after the shift in market structure.
*   **Price Swing Measurement:** A price swing measurement is taken from the low up to the high using candle bodies rather than wicks, as bodies tell the story and the wicks do the damage.
*   **Model 2022 Target:** Target the high.
*   **Buy the Fair Value Gap:** The model 2022 entry is to buy the fair value gap and take the first profit at the buy-side liquidity.
*   **Inefficiency Target:** Aim for the inefficiency with the midpoint consequent encroachment and the two-candle order block low.
*   **Perfect Alignment:** This level aligns perfectly.
*   **Market Breaks Lower:** The market subsequently breaks lower.
*   **Silver Bullet Qualification:**
    *   The speaker reviews whether this setup qualifies as an **ICT Silver Bullet trade.**
    *   Example entry point: 1.0782
*   **Pip Movement:** The speaker assesses whether the trade can move 15 pips higher, allowing for a 10-pip profit.
*   **Meeting Criteria:** In this case, the setup meets the minimum criteria.
*   **Pyramiding Opportunity:**
    *   The setup also presents a **pyramiding entry** opportunity.
    *   The speaker notes that it's not at a premium.
*   **Pyramiding Rules:** The speaker emphasizes that pyramiding is only possible if it meets specific criteria and isn't too rich in a premium or discount.
*   **Consistent Principles:** The speaker stresses that the same principles are applied consistently.
*   **Note-Taking Importance:** The speaker urges viewers to take notes.
*   **In-Depth Knowledge:** The speaker emphasizes that the "real meat" isn't included in short duration videos.
*   **Qualified ICT Silver Bullet:** This specific scenario qualified as an ICT Silver Bullet for a long position into a fair value gap inefficiency, followed by a change in the state of delivery.
*   **Fair Value Gap Formation and Time:**
    *   The speaker clarifies the rules surrounding fair value gap formation and entry timing.
    *   Example at 10 o'clock.
    *   While the fair value gap can form before 10 o'clock, the entry must be taken between 10 and 11 AM.
*   **Rule Adherence:** Emphasizes that rules must be followed. If not, the results are attributed to luck.
*   **Inversion Fair Value Gap:** Everything shifts bearish and moves lower.

## Evolving Silver Bullet and Trade Management

*   **Utilizing Lows:** The low can be used, as this low ran up into that inefficiencies consequent portrait.
*   **Trigger:** That low is the trigger for a shift in market structure.
*   **Inefficiency or Fair Value Gap:** There is no fair value gap.
*   **Breakaway Gap:** There is a breakaway gap.
*   **Fair Value Gap Formation:** There is a fair value gap that forms.
*   **Evolving Silver Bullet:** This is an evolving silver bullet.
*   **Importance of Directional Knowledge:** Knowing where price needs to go is critical.
*   **Gospel:** Without knowing where price is trying to gravitate towards, everything else will fail.
*   **Repricing and Liquidity:**
    *   Price is either running for liquidity.
    *   Or running for buy stops above the old highs.
    *   Or sell stops below the old lows.
*   **Inversion Fair Value Gap Scenario:** Given the inversion fair value gap, the change in state of delivery, and the order block, the expectation is for a move lower.
*   **Entry Scenario:** An entry opportunity is identified within the gap.
*   **Profit Targets:**
    *   Potential targets include a low.
    *   And relatively equal lows.
*   **15 Pip Filter:** The same 15-pip filter applies.
*   **Silver Bullet Entry:** Targeting these lows could represent a silver bullet entry.
*   **Lunchtime Target:** The market fills it later during lunchtime.
*   **Limit Order Entry:** Getting short inside the gap with a limit order.
*   **Razor Precision:** The speaker emphasizes the razor precision of the approach.
*   **Market Order Avoidance:** The speaker advises that entries are not via a market order.
*   **Demonstration Purpose:** Market entries are used to show examples and to give a greater sense of comfort.
*   **Addressing Accusations:** The speaker addresses potential accusations of faking trades using an MT4 server or gaming TradingView.
*   **TradingView Confirmation:** The speaker invites TradingView to verify the authenticity of his trades.
*   **Liquidity Run:** The entry runs the liquidity.
*   **Order Fills:** Referring to the filling of the orders.
*   **Not Trade Executions:** These are not actual trade entries, he is just showing turning points.
*   **Recording Reference:** The speaker references a recording he did the other day.

## S&P Analysis and Potential Default Scenario

*   **Transition to S&P Analysis:** Moving to an analysis of the S&P.
*   **Low Battery Warning:** Warning that the speaker's battery is low.
*   **Cliffhanger:** The possibility of a cliffhanger because of the low battery situation.
*   **Order Block:** The speaker mentions an order block.
*   **Debt Ceiling Concerns:** There is a lot of talk about the debt ceiling not being raised and maybe default.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, retaining all details and nuances while enhancing clarity and structure.

# S&P Analysis: Potential Default Scenario and Key Levels

## Potential Market Impact of Debt Ceiling Issues

*   If the debt ceiling is not raised, it could potentially send the market down to a specific area.
*   The speaker isn't predicting this, but rather highlighting key levels of interest on their chart.

## Daily Chart Analysis: Fair Value Gap and Order Block

*   The daily chart shows a **fair value gap** that price traded down into today.
*   There's also an **order block** noted on the daily chart.
*   How the market trades relative to these levels is important going forward.
*   The speaker is positive on the fact that the market traded up into the **consequent quotient** this week before working lower.
*   In the speaker's opinion, this area is the "last line of defense" for the bulls.
*   If this area is lost, the speaker is interested in sell-side liquidity below.

## SMT Divergence and Liquidity

*   The speaker mentions that they weren't confident that a high was in place due to a divergence between the ES (E-mini S&P 500 futures) and NASDAQ.
*   However, a more pronounced **SMT (Smart Money Tool) divergence** has emerged:
    *   NASDAQ went higher relatively speaking.
    *   S&P failed to do so.
*   Price moved down into an inefficiency and sell stops.
*   Overall, this is a draw on liquidity, which is desirable to see in price action.

## Hourly Chart Analysis: Fair Value Gap and Bearish Order Block

*   The hourly chart shows a small **fair value gap**.
*   The market traded up into that gap and worked lower.
*   There's a **bearish order block** present, with multiple rejections before displacement to the downside.
*   The market is trading into sell-side inefficiency as well, a deep discount.
*   This sell-side liquidity has the speaker's attention.
*   The speaker is unsure if this can be used as an inversion fair value gap.
*   The speaker will wait to see what happens at the opening tomorrow morning.

## 15-Minute Chart Analysis: New Week Opening and Inefficiencies

*   The 15-minute chart highlights:
    *   **Current New Week Opening High**.
    *   **Current New Week Opening Gap Low**.
*   There's a **fair value gap** mentioned previously.
*   Sell-side liquidity was taken.
*   Consolidation occurred inside of the **new week opening gap**, followed by an aggressive break lower.
*   There is a **fair value gap** that market trades up into and then trades the **consequent encroachment**.

## Support and Resistance and Order Blocks

*   Explaining how the low could become support turn resistance.
*   This is because of the inefficiency right there.
*   The market trades up into it and then sells off down into the imbalance, **fair value gap** and **sell-side liquidity**.
*   An **order block** consisting of three candles is holding price back near the 70 level of the range.
*   This creates a new equilibrium gap.
*   The speaker points out the consequent encroachment and midpoint of that sells off.
*   Delivery inefficiency is what the market is underneath right now.
*   The speaker acknowledges they are disconnected from live price action due to their location.
*   They favor downside, but are unsure how the market will deliver overnight during regular trading hours.

## Opening Range Gap Analysis

*   The **opening range gap** is shaded on the chart.
*   The market only worked to lower 50% of that gap, leaving the upper portion open.
*   If the market trades higher, it will likely want to go up into this open section of price action.
*   If it finds support at the **opening range gap high**, it could resume going higher.
*   Until the market gets above the **new week opening gap low**, the speaker is bearish.

## 5-Minute Chart and Smooth Lows

*   The **opening range gap** is analyzed on the 5-minute chart.
*   Inefficiency is described as a sell-side imbalance, buy-side inefficiency, and consequent encroachment (midpoint of that).
*   The market sells off into the order block.
*   The speaker believes the market needs to run up into a short-term premium and then potentially wipe out the lows.
*   They don't like how "smooth" the lows look, implying they are easily manipulated.

## Silver Bullet Strategy and Rule-Based Trading

*   Referencing previous silver bullet rules the presenter has given to the audience.
*   The rules state that:
    *   There needs to be 10 handles range
    *   The AM Silver Bullet is between 10 o'clock in the morning and 11 o'clock in the morning.

## Potential Silver Bullet Setups

*   A **fair value gap** is identified where the market trades up into it.
*   10 handles from that point is at the low or lower.
*   The speaker doesn't believe it can get below that because previous lows have been taken out, and there is a higher low present.
*   The market wicked down into this and is consolidating inside of that opening range gap.
*   This setup would not be a silver bullet trade that could meet the criteria.

## ICT Silver Bullet Confirmation

*   Identifying an order block the market trades up into.
*   This is a shift in market structure which confirms a potential ICT Silver Bullet.
*   The second one here, if one wanted to go after it, is also valid.
*   10 handles from here to there is this discount fair value gap so this Silver Bullet has met the rules.
*   These specific examples are high probability and it delivers.

## Rule Adherence and Disclaimer

*   The speaker emphasizes the importance of following the rules they have provided.
*   Failure to adhere to the rules may result in unsuccessful trades.
*   The speaker stated it is in there every single day every single day and if you give behind the rules, I gave you, it'll serve you well."
*   The speaker thanks the audience and ends the recording.

# **Market Analysis: Dollar Index, Euro/USD, and E-Mini S&P (May 24, 2023)**

**(Video URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfnY2SH3G24)**

## **Introduction**

"Foreign welcome back folks it's gonna be a brief one here today, take a look at this wrist that's going before we begin all right."
This analysis covers the Dollar Index, Euro/Dollar, and E-Mini S&P. It references a previous live stream session. For optimal understanding, viewers are advised to watch the live stream recording from the previous evening (available on the YouTube channel in the **2023 Internship Playlist**) before reviewing this analysis, to avoid perceived "cherry-picking."

## **Dollar Index Analysis**

### **Weekly Chart**

*   Observed a price draw up into the low and open of a bearish candle, specifically a **weekly bearish order block**.
*   The shaded area, a fair value gap between specific candle's low and another's high, was treated as an **inversion fair value gap**, acting as support.

### **Daily Chart**

*   The **weekly bearish order block** opening price is extended onto the daily chart.
*   On Wednesday, May 24, 2023, price opened and dropped to Monday's high.
*   The shaded area functioned as an **inversion fair value gap**, providing support.
*   Trading down into Monday's high is described as an **immediate rebalance**, a powerful indicator *if* the directional bias and draw on liquidity are known.

#### **Key Concepts:**

*   **Immediate Rebalance:** Occurs when price opens, trades down, and goes directly to a previous candle's high.
*   The speaker's target was the **weekly bearish order block** opening price. The expectation beyond that level is unclear due to personal circumstances.
*   It's important to note the speaker was dealing with emotional stress because of his dog, Bella, collapsing, influencing focus and clarity.

## **Euro/Dollar Analysis**

### **Weekly Chart**

*   Anticipated a draw towards a specific order block.

### **Daily Chart**

*   Mirror image observed compared to the Dollar Index analysis (bearish bias for Euro, bullish for Dollar).
*   Price opened, traded up to Monday's low (**immediate rebalance**), and then moved lower.
*   Relative equal lows are present.
*   A fair value gap exists near the **weekly bullish order block**.
*   A downside draw is favored, even with Dollar Index consolidation. No bullish signals are currently apparent.

### **Hourly Chart**

*   **Monday's low** is highlighted as an **immediate rebalance**.
*   Relative equal highs are identified, potentially acting as retail resistance.
*   Sell-side liquidity was targeted, as mentioned in the previous live stream.
*   After rallying and engaging buy-side liquidity, the market revisited Monday's low (**immediate rebalance**) before displacement to the downside.
*   Relative equal lows remain. The 1.07 big figure level is still considered a downside draw.
*   Expectation for potential movement into a sell-side imbalance buy-side inefficiency before potentially resuming lower, especially heading into Asia and London trading sessions.

### **5-Minute Chart (AM Session)**

*   The market rallied into Monday's low (**immediate rebalance**), tapped it again, and then broke a swing low (shift in market structure).
*   The **10 AM to 11 AM** window is identified as the potential for an **ICT Silver Bullet trade**.
*   Two potential entry points are highlighted using fair value gaps:
    *   A fair value gap formed *prior* to 10 AM.
    *   A fair value gap formed *within* the 10 AM to 11 AM window.
*   Both entries are considered valid because of the **rejection block**.

#### **Rejection Block**

*   The lowest closing price of down-closed candles.
*   Acts as a potential profit target when looking for shorts, especially when relative equal lows exist.
*   In this example, the rejection block price is 1.07506. Potential short entry prices were in the 1.0772-74 range.
*   The potential short offered more than 15 pips.

## **E-Mini S&P Analysis**

### **Daily Chart**

*   A bullish outlook was maintained until the mean threshold of an order block and a fair value gap were lost.
*   These areas acted as discount arrays.
*   Losing those levels would trigger a move to clear out sell-side liquidity.
*   Caution is advised due to the holiday weekend and potential for unforeseen events. The speaker alludes to "tenfold hat discussions" and suggests reading between the lines regarding senators being offered satellite phones, implying potential urgency for a downward price movement fueled by fear.
*   Relative equal lows exist, indicating remaining sell-side liquidity.

### **Hourly Chart**

*   The lows are highlighted as areas where sell-side liquidity could be raided.
*   Losing the mean threshold and fair value gap resulted in them being treated as an **inversion fair value gap**.
*   Price rallied into this area (consequent encouragement) before selling off, attacking sell-side liquidity.
*   The bodies of the candles stopped right at the lows, indicating liquidity was targeted.

### **15-Minute Chart**

*   A buy-side liquidity pool was targeted.
*   News at 8:30 AM triggered a sell-side imbalance buy-side inefficiency, leading to displacement to the downside and clearing sell stops below the 4120 level.
*   In the final hour of trading, a shift in market structure occurred.
*   Price retraced into a bullish fair value gap, representing buy-side imbalance buy-side efficiency and an order block.
*   Price rallied back into a fair value gap and, more specifically, into the opening range gap.

### **5-Minute Chart**

*   **Regular Trading Hours (RTH)** gap is identified by looking at where Tuesday closed versus where the regular session opened.
*   While gaps tend to fill, a strong bias can override this tendency.
*   The strong narrative (Dollar Index strength, Euro weakness) favored the objective of the 4120 level and the sell stops resting below it.
*   Although it's generally advisable to avoid shorting when a gap exists, the strong narrative in play led to the objective of the 4120 level being reached.
*   Price consolidated around noon, corresponding to New York lunch and the midpoint of the day, coinciding with the downside objective being met.

### **1-Minute Chart**

*   An up-close candle (bearish order block) is identified after being broken, signifying a shift in the state of delivery.
*   The market retraced into this order block during the 10 AM to 11 AM window, representing the potential **ICT Silver Bullet**.
*   The speaker stresses that a single 1-minute chart may not always reveal a clear fair value gap, and understanding real order flow, as discussed in previous live streams and Twitter spaces, is crucial.
*   The speaker uses an intraday matrix to analyze order flow with multiple intraday Matrix time frames, including 45-second, 30-second, 15-second, 5-second, and 1-second charts.

### **15-Second Chart Example**

*   The same order block from the 1-minute chart is examined.
*   Price action above the 15-second order block is analyzed for inefficiencies.
*   An inefficiency (fair value gap) is identified within the order block.
*   The market rallying into this inefficiency provides a short entry opportunity.
*   Smart money shorts when the market rallies into this inefficiency.
*   This action aligns with the broader narrative of the 4120 liquidity target, driven by the Dollar Index reaching its weekly bearish order block level.
*   The am ICT Silver Bullet is thus executed on a lower timeframe, taking advantage of the inefficiencies within a higher timeframe setup.

# **Dissecting Order Flow: ICT Silver Bullet, Liquidity, and Market Structure (May 24, 2023)**

## **Introduction**

This analysis delves into dissecting order flow, particularly focusing on the ICT Silver Bullet trade, liquidity targets, and shifts in market structure. It emphasizes the importance of understanding market narratives and predetermined levels for both inefficiency and liquidity.

## **Understanding Order Flow on Lower Timeframes**

*   **Profitability on Small Timeframes:** Even on choppy days, profitability is achievable by understanding and working with very small time frames.
*   **Account Growth:** With proper knowledge and experience, these methods can be used to grow your trading account.
*   **X-Ray View:** This approach provides an "x-ray view" into real order flow.
*   **Narrative and Predetermined Levels:** The method relies on having a narrative and understanding where the market is likely to move based on inefficiencies or liquidity targets.

### **E-Mini S&P Example: Targeting 4120 Level**

*   **Mean Threshold Loss:** It was mentioned in a previous analysis that losing the mean threshold on the E-Mini S&P would lead to a move lower, targeting the 4120 level.
*   **Sell-Side Liquidity:** The 4120 level represented sell-side liquidity.
*   **Trade Viability:** The question is posed: Was it a viable trade to target this level?
*   **Liquidity Below 4120:** It's reasonable to expect the market to move below 4120 to capture liquidity.
*   **Example Scenario:** If entry was at 4127.75 and the target was 4117.75, the trade offered 10 handles.
*   **ICT Silver Bullet Criteria:** The minimum criteria for a high-probability ICT Silver Bullet trade is 10 handles, and this trade met the criteria.
*   **Proof of Concept:** The concepts discussed deliver results, highlighted minutes after 11:00 AM.

## **Platform Considerations: TradingView**

*   **Information Accessibility:** Achieving the 10-handle move requires information available on platforms offering specific timeframes.
*   **TradingView's Advantages:** TradingView is a good platform, allowing for comprehensive teaching and widespread use among students.
*   **Alternative Platforms:** While platforms like NinjaTrader and TradeStation exist, TradingView facilitates community learning.
*   **Community Choice:** TradingView was chosen as an alternative to MT4 based on community feedback.
*   **Community Learning:** The speaker acknowledges learning new things about the platform from students.

## **Analyzing the Price Action After 4120 Level**

*   **First Pass:** The first move below 4120 during the Silver Bullet trade didn't show an obvious inefficiency on the 5-minute chart.
*   **Further Decline:** The market then traded lower, reaching 10 handles below 4120 (4117.75).
*   **Low of the Day:** The low of the day was formed at noon.

## **Dollar Index Correlation**

*   **Simultaneous Dollar Index Movement:** At the same time the E-Mini S&P made its low, the Dollar Index moved up to a weekly bearish order block opening price.
*   **End of the Day:** Breaching the stops and taking out the sell-side liquidity marked the end of the day's primary objective.
*   **Consolidation:** The market is expected to consolidate until the last hour of the day.
*   **Dollar Index Target Met:** This consolidation occurs because the Dollar Index had reached its target.
*   **Index Futures and Opening Range:** Index futures are expected to move towards the opening range.

## **Opening Range and Regular Trading Hours (RTH)**

*   **RTH on 5-Minute Chart:** The Regular Trading Hours (RTH) are shown on a 5-minute chart.
*   **Electronic Trading Hours (ETH):** The Electronic Trading Hours (ETH) price action is displayed in the lower right corner.
*   **Last Hour Displacement:** The last hour of trading (3:00 PM to 4:00 PM New York time) shows a displacement to the upside.
*   **Shift in Market Structure:** There's a shift in market structure, with an order block forming.

## **Post-Lunch Reversal and Gap Fill Expectations**

*   **Inbound Movement:** Three consecutive down-closed candles form an order block.
*   **Fair Value Gap:** Price trades into a fair value gap, then works towards filling another gap.
*   **Lunch Reversal:** A shift in market structure occurs after 12:00 PM, indicative of a lunch reversal.
*   **Gap Fill Expectation:** The expectation is to see price trade up to 4158 and close the gap.
*   **Further Potential:** There's potential to fill a smaller gap beyond that.

## **Contingency Planning**

*   **Scenario:** If price trades up and fills the gap, then starts to fall again, the Dollar Index would need to be moving higher.
*   **Targeting Lows:** In that scenario, the relative equal lows on the S&P would be the next target.

## **Recap and Call to Action**

*   **Successful Prediction:** The speaker highlights the ability to "cherry-pick" a daily/weekly candle and have it deliver as outlined previously.
*   **Patience and Understanding:** Emphasizes the need to avoid impatience and focus on learning to identify draws on liquidity.
*   **Continued Learning:** The importance of consistently showing up, reviewing, and learning to see key aspects of price action is stressed.
*   **Ongoing Support:** The speaker commits to continue providing analyses and insights.
*   **Closing Remarks:** Concludes with well wishes for viewers' safety and a promise to communicate again soon.

# **Market Analysis: Dollar Index and Euro/Dollar**

## **Introduction**

Welcome back, folks! Let's dive into this week's analysis of the **Dollar Index** and **Euro/Dollar**. Remember, it's crucial to take notes on these analyses and apply them to your charts for backtesting and understanding the market dynamics. Don't get caught up in just passively watching the videos; active learning is key.

## **Dollar Index Analysis**

### **Weekly Chart**

*   We've been accurately predicting the Dollar Index's movements day by day.
*   The index traded up into the **up-close candle**.
*   Initially, attention was drawn to the **opening price**, which was hit yesterday, followed by an anticipated continuation upside, leading to further weakness in Euro/Dollar. This transpired today.
*   The next target is the **mean threshold** of this up-close candle.

    *   **Mean Threshold Defined:** The halfway point from the high to the low of the up-close candle.
    *   **Level:** 104.540

*   This level should be marked on your chart.
*   The imbalance from this candle's low to this candle's high was expected to act as support, springing price higher, and it did.
*   No **Wyckoff** required.

### **Daily Chart**

*   Here is that **Weekly order block**. The opening price is what that was.
*   Without the context of the weekly chart, the anchoring point might seem confusing.
*   The focus is on the opening price of the **weekly candle**.
*   There is an imbalance within this area and a **daily order block**.
*   This is that big **up-close candle**.
*   The opening price of the highest up-close candle is annotated. This level was hit today, slightly exceeding the imbalance's scope.
*   It remains to be seen if the Dollar Index will reach the **104.54** level.

### **Fair Value Gaps (FVG) and Inefficiencies**

*   Yesterday's idea of the index opening and trading down to the previous day's high, without offering an opportunity for a deferred inefficiency, was discussed.
*   **Fair Value Gap (FVG) Definition:** An inefficiency created when the market moves too quickly, leaving an imbalance in price.

    *   Because the candles are moving higher, the imbalance is buy-side.
    *   **Buy-Side Imbalance, Sell-Side Inefficiency (SIBI)**: Inefficient in offering down delivery or movement on the downside.
    *   Price rotation on a **liquidity continuum basis** efficiently delivers price within a defined range.

*   **Example:** Price moving between 103.20 and 103.40 multiple times.
*   If price is moving back and forth in a defined range and we have a bias, when the opening price drops down to a previous high, it creates an opportunity.
*   Normally, not reaching Monday's high would create a typical deferred inefficiency, leading to a standard Fair Value Gap protocol.
*   A Fair Value Gap is defined as the range between this candle's high and this candle's low, where price only moves in one direction within those two reference points.

    *   A specific category example is a **Sell-Side Imbalance, Buy-Side Inefficiency (SIBI)**.
    *   This requires seeing what to be efficiently balanced upside delivery, which occurs on this candle.

*   During this weekly candle's formation, it was mentioned that this area would be used as an **inversion fair value Gap**.
*   It's important to understand narrative.
*   Mentoring is key to grasping these nuances.
*   Consistent exposure and repetition are necessary for learning.

### **Immediate Rebalance**

*   Yesterday, the concept of an **immediate rebalance** was introduced.
*   If the market opens and trades down to a previous day's high, without any room or opportunity for inefficiency, and we're bullish, this formation is a powerful signature for immediate dynamic price delivery.
*   **Immediate Rebalance Definition:** Trading down to a previous day's high without offering a fair value gap. This signals strong bullish momentum.
*   This is one of the strongest algorithmic price delivery signatures.
*   Price delivered rapidly on the Dollar Index.
*   Two days prior, it was stated that the Dollar Index was expected to reach a specific level on Tuesday's analysis and Wednesday's delivery, which it did.
*   It was also mentioned that it might not move above a certain fair value gap, providing context.
*   This context, combined with the immediate rebalance, indicated a continuation higher on the Dollar Index and lower on Euro/Dollar.
*   This indicates a **risk-off scenario**.

    *   **Risk-Off Scenario:** Dollar goes higher, and foreign currencies typically decline.
*   The immediate rebalance allows for a bullish directional bias: Buy Dollar, short foreign currency.

## **Euro/Dollar Analysis**

### **Weekly Chart**

*   Further expansion was observed within the **Weekly Order Block**.
*   The opening price of this block remains a likely draw for price.
*   Last night's analysis was reversed; while the Dollar Index had an immediate rebalance, which is bullish, Euro/Dollar mirrored this development.
*   Yesterday, the market opened, traded up to Monday's low, and then accelerated downwards.
*   Attention was drawn to two relative equal lows, indicating sell-side liquidity below.
*   Price traded down into this area and pulled off that low.
*   The sell-side liquidity below the relative equal lows was tapped into.
*   This is a fair value Gap between this candle's low and this candle's high.

    *   Price needs to trade down to it, through it, or go back up it has to leave this area once it offers a down candle passing through that same range that's shaded in Orange
    *   The blue line is that Weekly order block the opening price

*   The expectation is for continued downward movement into this area, aiming for the 1.07 big figure. This might be delayed due to the holiday weekend.
*   Regardless, the bias remains: higher Dollar, weaker Euro/Dollar.
*   The line indicates those two daily candles, those relative equal lows.
*   Price dipped down into this area.
*   It was said that it would go lower but it would likely go higher first it's for a short-term premium and then drop go down.
*   Listen to the recordings every single time you do a video.

### **Contingency Planning**

*   If the Euro reverses and the Dollar tops out, would the analysis be a failure? No, because it offered an opportunity to see a run from where we were last night.
*   It's crucial to note expectations and potential scenarios.
*   Transparency is provided when there is uncertainty.
*   "*Gun to my head*" signifies a strong belief based on price action. This does not mean you should bet on it.
*   The goal is to learn to read price action.
*   This approach will improve visibility, increase trading consistency and your skill set.

### **15-Minute Chart**

*   The imbalance was highlighted.
*   Price attempted to drop into a short-term premium.
*   Price went right up into that inefficiency one more time.
*   It broke lower, working into the eventual relative equal low from the daily chart, digging into it twice before consolidating into the close.

### **5-Minute Chart**

*   The opening price at midnight New York time is highlighted and extended through price action to around 11:00 AM.
*   **Bearish Scenario:** If bearish, any return to that opening price presents a short opportunity, provided the objective hasn't been met.

    *   The objective was the relative equal lows and the fair value Gap (around 1.0705 to 1.07 big figure).

*   During the morning session, price ran out these relative equal highs.

    *   This is advantageous because smart money can use these buy stops as counterparty to their shorts.

*   The market drops lower, falling just short of the relative equal lows.
*   It trades back up, drops back down, hits an order block, rallies again, falls short of hitting that order block, trades right into that Gap and then drops.
*   Where's it dropping to just below the short term relative equal lows here
*   During the 7:00 AM session in New York time, it rallies back up for a third time after London lunch.
*   During the 8:30 window, the news embargo lifts, and it hits the order block, runs the buy stop, and trades above the New York opening price.
*   **Power Three Concept:** The midnight opening price (New York time) is key.

    *   **Bullish:** Best buys are below the opening price.
    *   **Bearish:** Best shorts are at or above the opening price.

*   Your chart should be set to New York local time (UTC -4 currently due to daylight savings).
*   The midnight opening price, in conjunction with the Power Three concept, sees price wiping out buy-side liquidity while targeting sell-side liquidity below (the relative equal lows on the daily chart). The market gravitates towards it.
*   Below this line, are cell stops.



Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text. I have strived to maintain every detail, nuance, and the original speaker's tone while improving readability and structure.

## **Euro/Dollar Analysis: Midnight Opening Price and Liquidity**

### **Smart Money and Liquidity Engineering**

*   The **opening price at midnight** offers an opportunity for smart money to sell short.
*   This conveniently allows the **short-term buy stops** that the market saw to get tripped.
*   The run-up stopped out anyone that was short, and then anyone short on this move gets stopped out there.
*   Liquidity is engineered:
    *   **Buy stops** are placed here.
    *   **Buy stops** are placed here.
*   The algorithm runs up there, allowing **smart money** to go short, using the midnight opening price.
*   The target is the relative equal lows on the daily chart, specifically the **1.07132 level**.
*   Price drops just short of this level.
*   It rallies one more time back up into the inefficiency, then breaks hard into that pool of liquidity resting below those daily relative equal lows.
*   If you are a new viewer, this may seem complicated. Keep watching the videos, and you'll learn it. Institutional order flow cannot be learned by just watching a few videos.
*   Look at things and see it from the eyes of someone who has seen, experienced, and done it for a longer time.
*   Since these Concepts are authored, it's imperative that you:
    *   Take notes.
    *   Look at these things in past price data.
*   Don't just take my word for something.
*   You can hear what I'm expecting in future price moves and see it happen, but don't limit your study to just whatever I think is going to happen next.
*   Take your time between our sessions.
*   Go back to old moves in price action and study and look at the things I'm teaching.
*   Does it materialize in your study? You'll find that it does.

### **Order Blocks and Fair Value Gaps**

*   These two up-close candles here are the **order block**.
*   It's a bearish order block that trades up into that and then works lower once more.
*   This signals a **shift in market structure**.
*   This right here is a **Model 2022 buy-side swept low taken**.
*   Is there a fair value gap in here? Yes, right there.
*   Price trades up into it.
*   You can get short there and aim for one more pass into that sell-side liquidity pool.
*   There are relative equal lows, and price digs into it there and bounces off of that.
*   We consolidate into the close for the day.

## **Euro/Dollar: One-Minute Chart Analysis**

### **Viewing Euro/Dollar from a One-Minute Perspective**

*   We are dialed in on that actual run into the sell-side.
*   These are that relative equal lows on the daily chart (that level right there).
*   Here's our sell-off here, breaks lower.
*   We have relative equal highs and relative equal lows.
*   We are creating this little trading range with the bias being what?
*   All during this consolidation, we are anticipating, as I mentioned last night, wanting to see Euro/Dollar trade down in that sell-side liquidity.
*   I mean sell stops resting below **1.0713**.
*   Price drops aggressively down into that right in here, then whips right back above it.
*   Price trades one more time below it, but only to consequent encroachment, which is the midpoint of this gap from this candle's high to that candle's low.
*   Measure on your own; the Fibonacci is at that level right there.
*   It hits it, then we come back to life, rallying higher short-term high.
*   Once this liquidity below, there are relative equal lows on the daily chart is engaged, we can anticipate what? The market to want to pull back inside the range.
*   We're seeing it do that.

### **Buy and Sell-Side Liquidity**

*   What's left up here? **Buy-side liquidity**.
*   There are **buy stops**.
*   Who would look at this as retail resistance? The average trader that reads a book, watches a few YouTube videos, and they think that everything works on these imaginary support and resistance lines.
*   They're going to trust this and be short, thinking, okay, I can put my stop loss up here.
*   What kind of stop? A buy stop to protect them.
*   The market quickly runs for those buy stops because the algorithm does not want them to pull their order.
*   Smart money distributes their short position and buys up here, and then adds for a long here to ride it up to these buy stops.

### **Order Blocks and Breakers**

*   We have an order block up here, trades above, trades back down into a **breaker** (low high lower low).
*   The highest up-close candle is right in here.
*   Take that range on your own chart and extend it forward.
*   We're turning back into that bullish breaker.
*   Price trades up into it and hits the order block there, then we consolidate going into the **London close**.
*   London close is between 10 o'clock in the morning to noon.
*   We get a fair value gap here multiple times.
*   This is time distortion where it just stays inside of a range.
*   It's already priced in the high, just stays in that range, doesn't work outside that.
*   Look at the bodies; the Wicks will go just outside that fair value gap, but that's okay; it's permissible.
*   Then we would expect it to trade lower again, reaching back down into the daily relative equal lows again.

## **Euro/Dollar: Refining the One-Minute Chart Analysis**

*   Here's that move here.
*   We have 10 to 11 your fair value gap after hitting the order block.
*   This would be your fill, but you could have multiple opportunities that go short trading for the New York stop run.
*   Where would that be? That low right here is where stops are.
*   This is the most energetic run prior to New York lunch.
*   New York lunch is 12 to 1.
*   Prior to that 12 o'clock, where's the most energetic price move on the outside right there.
*   What is that going to be? That's the target.
*   The algorithm will run down create a fair value gap.
*   It trades up in here, breaks lower.
*   Very gap hits it, institutional order flow entry drill, which is a partial entry into a gap that does not completely fill.
*   It breaks one more time.
*   Gap order block two consecutive up-close candles, trades into it perfectly.
*   Price drops one more time, that low takes out that low right there, then it Springs back into the range.
*   That range right there, also if you look closely, is a breaker.
*   The lowest down close candle high low high extend the forward there's your range.
*   These two consecutive down close candles make up one quarter block.
*   The order block here is the breaker.
*   Why am I not using this one this candle went lower ICT you're using the candles that have the the lower body this is the lower body also this is also occurring right immediately after the high I would not look at this as a breaker otherwise for instance let's just say that this body here didn't go as low as the close it has in this candle say it was closing higher than that candle is closed and it was up here I wouldn't even refer to it as a breaker there wouldn't even refer to this at all as a break if it did that but because it did this high low higher high remember the Wicks do the damage so I'm going to look at that Wick and discard it it's a one minute chart so you can't refine much more beyond that if we're looking for a range for defining a breaker okay so high low higher high two down closed candles extend that forward we're seeing it trade up into the breaker there and right there as well and then we see price reach back one more time below the low prior to New York session lunch which is noon to one o'clock.
*   It runs in here and then back inside the range.

## **E-Mini S&P Analysis**

### **Weekly Chart**

*   We traded down below last week's low and we're back inside the range.

### **Daily Chart**

*   We worked inside that sell-side according pool.
*   As I'll show you in the lower time frames, uh this rectangle will be much more meaningful to you when we drop in lower time frames.
*   It's simply the opening range gap.
*   I want you to take notice of how the bodies of the candles here to close.
*   I'm sorry, the open of this candle here and the open of this candle here is right at that opening range.
*   It'll make much more sense when we go in a lower time frames, but we're just trading up inside this inefficiency here.
*   It'll be important to see if we reject that overnight going into tomorrow or if we power through that and completely close it.
*   If we trade above the gap between this candle's high and that candle's low, if we trade above it, I would treat that as a inversion gap, something that's bullish.
*   Right now, I'm looking at it as a potential area just to get short and look for lower prices because we have one two three relative equal lows here and that sell-side is really really juicy right now.
*   We've already seen this one two three four five six times go higher, so this to me looks a little too tempting for a run down below that.
*   Yes, it's a lot, but you know we have a lot of time between now at the time of this recording and the close, uh Friday's close especially if we continuously see the dollar Index and you know rallying higher.

### **Hourly Chart**

*   This is the south side according pool I mentioned that we would draw down into if we failed to find any support we got we got that as well look at the bodies I mentioned that yesterday evening and then yesterday I told you that I'm expecting it to draw up into a closure of the opening range and you'll see that in a minute but also up to the buy side right in here okay go watch the video from last night I've added it to the playlist for the 2023 mentorships every time I do a video if it's a live stream I have to add them to the the mentorship playlist like this one here I'm recording and pre-recording it and showing everything that we talked about last night came to pass and it'll just fall in the ICT mentorship 2023 playlist because I put it there but a live stream like you just can't go to my YouTube channel and just look at the last video you won't see it there you have to go click on the live tab but to make it easier for you I've added the live streams that I'm doing in the mentorship 2023 playlist so as I do them as I create them they go right into that playlist so if you want to bookmark that playlist you'll have all the videos I'm producing this year that are mentorship grade.
*   Here's Tuesday in Wednesday's opening range gap.
*   You probably remember that yesterday and I'd like to keep opening range gaps on my chart for three days.
*   That's one of those opportunities.
*   If you're not paying attention and just let me say it and you don't write it down, it's one of those gems that just simply will not make it in your understanding, but after three days, it expires in my mind.
*   It's all part of my **power three concept**, which I'll teach more about later.
*   It's not just simply the the Open high loan close or the accumulation manipulation distribution.
*   It's not just that it's much more than AMD.
*   Tuesday Wednesday opening range gap is shaded here.
*   That's what we were seeing on the daily chart.
*   Notice that from Tuesday crossing over to Wednesday's opening range gap, it was still being respected on Thursday hmm look at that look at the respect of it here look at this candle's High look at the bodies in here see that so there's a whole lot more going on behind the scenes that is algorithmic that unless you know about it it's completely you're completely oblivious to it the average Trader the average person that understands gaps they don't think about the market like this and that's What Separates Me from everybody else if you want to be an apex predator you have to hunt differently you have to be the first one to take the prey you can't wait around this is not the second mouse gets the cheese okay we are we're not mice we're Lions we're going out and we're taking it so the buy side is what I told you we would reach out for yesterday right up of here and that we would trade up into the high end of that Gap okay yesterday we were talking it was right about in here and then we opened up here traded down at six o'clock and then we meandered around and then found our way up to it and above it fell short of the buy solid liquidity here said the the objective is what still run no stops so it comes all the way back down to the low of that opening range gap from Tuesday and Wednesday now I'm sure you're probably scratching your head if this is the first time you watched the video what am I saying a Tuesday that Wednesday opening range gap is where do I get that information from right you have to change your chart to regular trading hours not electronic trading hours and you'll see the separation between the settlement parts and the opening price on the new day so this is what happened on Tuesday and we have one here also okay so I'm going to add this one I'm going to change this one to a different color it'll still be on the chart because it's very important you understand what's about to happen here it's shaded in Gray so it's there like a ghost behind the scenes no pun intended the ghost in the machine so we have the opening range gap for Wednesday Thursday now which is this now broader range so there's an overlapping of those two opening range gaps I promise you you will never see that in books anywhere now there's gonna be people out there that hurry up and run out there and print their books on Amazon and talk about this because I've said it today but this is the first time I've ever taught this even my charter members don't know this so today the 25th of May 2023 I'm teaching you something that I've never given to the public before so I want you to appreciate this if you run around your YouTube channel and create these mentorships of your own okay and you pretend that you knew this beforehand or have you always been doing it you're going to look a little foolish now so after we get this opening range gap here the old one Tuesday Wednesday we open above it trade down and find support at the lows of it you see that but it didn't fill this why Why didn't it fill that because it has unfinished business where's that unfinished business the buy stops up here ran up there hit it now we have a gap just like we were treating yesterday's Tuesday Wednesday opening Gap we had some portions still to fill in now we can look for this area here to potentially have a event fill it in tomorrow or reprice to it and that's my expectation going forward I probably am wrong okay so don't put too much weight or emphasis on it but that's how I look at it we're going into a holiday weekend anything can happen so I I'm really not even doing a video tomorrow I'm not going to be looking at the market tomorrow we're going to be doing something for our family so I could care less what the market does but if you're going to hold a gun to my head and say ICT tell me right now what you think I think that we're going to try to make an attempt to get down here and work towards this area here that's that's what I think okay if I'm wrong it would need to go back above current new week opening Gap high for me to be bullish again there you go so now we have both of those gaps we have Tuesday Wednesday opening range gap and we have the Wednesday Thursday opening range gap and we're back down here on electronic trading hours so you can see there's relative equal eyes I said there was buy side last night go watch the video that's where I think it's going to draw to and get to the top of that bold Tuesday Wednesday opening range got well we did that here then we fell short notice what we did we went above the Range High there but we didn't get to the buy side yet then it dropped all the way down to the low of that Gat see it followed along you still see it in here and then boom is gathering all kinds of new orders but not by itself look closer what is this at the lows so smart money is accumulating right in here Market rallies up comes back



Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text. I have strived to maintain every detail, nuance, and the original speaker's tone while improving readability and structure.

## **E-Mini S&P Analysis: Order Flow and Opening Gaps**

### **Refining the 5-Minute Chart Analysis**

*   Price moves down, then one more dip, and then takes off, trading into a **buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency** (a favorite setup).
*   There is an **order block** right there.
*   The target (as mentioned last night) is hit beautifully.
*   Does price continuously keep going higher? No, it rejects and comes back down into the range.
*   Price attempts the buy side one more time, pumps in, and then fails once more.
*   Watching to see if this potential **phantom trend line** breaks.
    *   If it does, we'll be looking for the sell side below and into the gap.
    *   That gap would otherwise be expected to normally fill, but again, it's a holiday weekend, so anything can happen. Volume will be different than normal, and many people will simply go away and not be trading. Bear that in mind.

### **New Day Opening Gap (NDOG) Analysis**

*   The new day opening gap, or **NDOG**, is a crucial concept (taught on the YouTube channel in the 2023 mentorship playlist).
*   The **closing price at 5:00 PM** and the **opening price at 6:00 PM** create a separation, which is shown here as the Wednesday-Thursday new day opening gap.
*   Extend that throughout the day, and you can see how we get consequent encroachment of it.
    *   **Consequent encroachment** is half of any inefficiency or gap.
    *   **Mean threshold** is half of any order block.
    *   It's very important to keep that distinction and understand it.
*   Price falls just short of hitting the top of it here, works outside of it, and then rallies one more time.
*   In this little area:
    *   Price is hitting an order block.
    *   Price is also in consequent encroachment of the low and the high of that gray-shaded area (the **Tuesday-Wednesday opening range gap**).
    *   That range is split in half, which is consequent encroachment.
*   The opening range gaps will be specifically covered in a tutorial video, which will bring all the loose ends together.
*   A little gap trades down into the low end of the new day opening gap for Wednesday-Thursday.
*   Important price levels (written down):
    *   These prices are labeled in the speaker's notes.
    *   Looking at them in terms of time.
*   Around the 8:30 News embargo:
    *   News is released.
    *   Impulsive price action occurs, running up, retracing, and running again.
    *   Price falls short of our objective and crashes all the way back down into an order block.
    *   This order block is also the low of that Tuesday-Wednesday opening range gap (the shaded area).
*   Price rallies one more time and then finally blows out the buy side that was mentioned last night as the objective for today's trading (Thursday, May 25th, 2023) for ES.
*   Price slips lower into consequent encroachment of the new day opening gap (the gray area).
*   Price rallies one more time to run into the **rejection block**, which is the highest up-close candle.

### **Order Flow and Tools**

*   There's a lot of information, but these are tools, concepts, and models accumulated over 30 years of experience.
*   You only need one setup. Find the ones that match your personality and make the most sense to you.
*   Not all of these things will make the most sense to everyone.
*   It might be just one or two things that resonate and allow you to make money.
*   Your job is to find that setup.
*   Don't try to press everything I know into every single chart because they won't always appear.
*   A breaker is not always there, a mitigation block is not always there, and an institutional order flow entry drill is not always there.
*   Bring your own personality into this.
*   There are many ways to "skin this cat."
*   A new model could be created every single day for an entire year and still not run out of ideas.
*   The market is reaching for inefficiencies and liquidity and is doing it on a time-based delivery schedule.
*   Remind yourself continuously that this is what this is about to remove the tendency to think it's too complicated.
*   See what time of day you want to trade, what market you want to trade, and what setup you want to trade.
*   If it's not there, do nothing, but it will exist at least once or twice a week, and that's enough.
*   The problem is wanting to be in every single session, every single day, and every swing, justifying why you're not in a move every single time.
*   You can't be in every move; you have to sleep and do things with your family.
*   Don't put that much pressure on yourself.

### **In-Depth Order Flow Analysis: The Silver Bullet**

*   This section may require revisiting multiple times to fully grasp.
*   The following analysis will be a little more in-depth.
*   Focus on the **10:00 AM to 11:00 AM Silver Bullet hour** in the AM session (ES on a one-minute chart).
*   At the high end of that old opening range gap:
    *   Price opens and then slams down.
    *   Price went outside the range of the opening range gap.
*   Price trades down into an **order block**.
    *   The blue line is that order block (on a five-minute chart).
    *   Focusing on the 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM price action.
*   The market drops down, and we create a fair value gap in the form of a **sell-side imbalance, buy-side inefficiency** (SIBI).
*   Price creates relative equal highs and relative equal lows.
*   Price trades down, remembering that shaded area.
    *   This is the low of the old opening range gap (Tuesday to Wednesday).
    *   Trading at the low of that old Tuesday-Wednesday opening range gap, hitting here, hitting here.
    *   Look at the bodies respecting it.
    *   Price goes just outside of here and then runs these relative equal lows there.
    *   The wicks are doing all the damage.
*   Price quickly runs back up and takes out a short-term high.
*   This is the **2022 model** that was taught on the YouTube channel: take stops, shift in market structure, fair value gap, buy it (that's your Silver Bullet).
*   Blend the 2022 model and the idea of the ICT Silver Bullet.
*   It isn't always going to be a continuation; treat it sometimes with a reversal.
*   Buy it here.
    *   The arrows are just for illustrative purposes and not executions.
*   Journaling:
    *   Annotate and reward yourself with positive self-talk, such as, "It was amazing to see this pan out the way I was expecting it to."
    *   When you look at it a week or a month later, you'll read that, and your subconscious remembers that as pseudo-experience.
    *   By conditioning yourself with positive self-talk (never putting anything negative in your journal entries), you're conditioning yourself to see the positive aspects of these types of things in price action.
    *   You trick your brain into seeing it like you actually did it, which helps fuel your motivation and removes the uncertainty because you're training your expectation, your understanding, and your subconscious to recognize these things quicker.
    *   Backtesting, studying, and journaling is very important.
    *   This right here is better than most technical books.
    *   The speaker took his 30 years of experience and applied it to this.
    *   Treat this like meditation.
    *   The more you put into this, the better you're going to be as a technician.
    *   That technician will make you the better trader than you've ever imagined, but you have to do this step.
    *   You can't skip over it.
    *   If you don't want to do it, then simply expect that you're going to fail.
    *   If you're trying to do it half-assed and not really putting an effort into doing it right, you're not going to be successful, and you have nobody to blame but yourself.
*   There are two opportunities here for the Silver Bullet.
    *   Price trades down into it.
    *   Price rallies up, takes the buy side here, and then runs into the bearish order block.
    *   It doesn't even need to trade outside of that old range on Wednesday-Thursday's opening range gap.
*   Profitability and being incorrect:
    *   Remember the rules for Silver Bullet for ES or index futures. It's got to offer at least a 10-handle range.
    *   If you're buying it down here at 4142 and you're expecting it to go up to the buy side, that's the best-case scenario, but you also have these gaps in here, this shaded area on here, and this one here.
    *   The algorithm will refer back to those same levels.
*   It's not just doing it today and yesterday; it's going to do this in perpetuity every day in the future.
*   It's going to remember these levels up to three days.
*   If you use three days as a general rule of thumb, it will serve you well.
*   After three days, take it off your chart.
*   Don't have all these on the same chart; create templates.
*   Templates are useful so you have a template that has all of the opening range gaps.
*   When the speaker is telling you that he has 12 different monitors and he's constantly referring to everything and cycling through everything, he's constantly getting information and intel, referring to these levels while prices are marching along.
*   He's not reacting to the price; he's anticipating it.
*   As a student of mine, you're going to learn how to anticipate too.
*   Retail traders react; they're essentially a breakout artist.
*   Anticipate specific things that occur, and when it does, we're already there.
*   We're meeting price right when it does whatever we're looking for.
*   We're buying when it's going down, and we're selling when it's going up.
*   That is completely diametrically opposed to retail-minded traders.
*   This is the market; this is exactly what the market is doing every single day.
*   This is why the speaker is accurate.
*   This is why you see the speaker call it beforehand, and it happens.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text. I have strived to maintain every detail, nuance, and the original speaker's tone while improving readability and structure.

## **Order Flow and ICT Silver Bullet: Advanced Analysis**

### **Student Success and Income Potential**

*   Students are successfully implementing the speaker's teachings.
*   They are exceeding traditional income, achieving **six-figure plus earnings**.
*   Learning to read price action effectively, requires significant effort.

### **ICT Silver Bullet Criteria: Handles and Points**

*   The ICT Silver Bullet strategy requires a potential **10-handle (or 10-point) move** in futures.
    *   Handles and points are synonymous in futures trading.
    *   The speaker acknowledges using "handles" due to his experience.
*   A "handle" refers to a full point move (4 ticks).
*   High probability trade criteria demands the potential for at least a 10-handle run in futures.
*   Example:
    *   Buy order at 4147.
    *   Potential fill at 4147.25 (allowing for spread).
    *   10 handles up would be 4157.25.
    *   This movement can occur even within the new day opening gap.
*   Profitability can be achieved by:
    *   Targeting Buy/Sell liquidity.
    *   Taking partial profits at key levels.
    *   Potential for pyramiding positions.
        *   Example: Using a model with six contracts. (Disclaimer: Not a suggestion for contract size).
    *   Pillaring: Buying one contract, buying another, selling one at a target, holding the last and trailing the stop loss to prevent a sudden reversal.
        *   Stop loss placement: Initially below the swing low, then trailed up.
*   Scenario:
    *   Price retraces to the low of an order block.
    *   Rallies to the high of the Tuesday-Wednesday opening range gap (shaded area).
    *   Drops back to the low of the new day opening gap.
    *   Encroaches on the Tuesday-Wednesday opening range gap.
        *   Trades down to the midpoint.
    *   Accumulates more positions, targeting the high of the new day opening gap (Wednesday-Thursday, orange shaded area).
    *   Analysis conducted on a 15-second chart of the opening range, new day opening gap, and Silver Bullet activity between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM.

### **Addressing Criticisms and Complexity**

*   A comment mentioned that **ICT concepts are complicated and difficult to implement.**
*   The speaker will address whether it's genuine frustration or trolling.
*   He strips price down to a one-minute chart and teaches the Silver Bullet in a Twitter space initially.
*   The Twitter space discussion was just an introduction to the concept.
*   Further development and refinement of these concepts will continue throughout the year.
*   Key question: What timeframe to look for Silver Bullets?
*   A fair value gap forms between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM New York time.
*   The fair value gap doesn't need to *form* within that hour, but the entry must occur during that window.
*   The one-minute chart shows the Silver Bullet and overlapping price action.
*   Price eventually leaves the range, creating a fair value gap, and then trades into it before moving away.
*   There is imbalance that needs to be addressed.

### **Institutional Order Flow: Deeper Dive**

*   Analysis will explore why price is stopping at certain levels.
*   **Institutional order flow** is present, invisible to standard tools.
    *   Volume profile analysis.
    *   Depth of market data.
    *   Level 2 data.
    *   These can be spoofed.
*   The speaker's approach never surprises him; he anticipates market movements.
*   Recommendation: **Pause the video and study the charts** to understand price movements and Silver Bullet entries.

### **15-Second Chart Analysis: Precision and Refinement**

*   The sell-side imbalance, buy-side inefficiency is on the 15-second chart.
*   Price runs down to a low, creating relative equal lows.
*   A shallow run below these lows indicates a retracement will lead to further downside.
*   Price rallies to a fair value gap, which also acts as a **mitigation block**.
    *   Mitigation Block: Down-close candle between a high and lower high.
    *   Breaker Pattern: Typically, a high, low, higher high.
*   Price engineered a low, enticing retail traders to buy perceived support.
*   Rally provided false hope, then price declined, stopping out traders or forcing stops below previous lows.
*   Price rallied again, taking out a short-term high.
*   Shift in Market Structure is indicated.
*   A fair value gap is created on the one-minute chart.
*   The speaker uses a 15-second chart for precise analysis.
*   If you're not interested in 15-second charts, this lesson isn't essential.
*   Model 2022 can be used independently.
*   Aiming for Technical Science not just Technical Analysis.
*   The speaker teaches Technical Science, not conjecture or guesswork.

### **Intraday Matrix and Order Block Confirmation**

*   Within the shaded area on the one-minute chart is a fair value gap, visible on the 15-second chart.
*   The speaker uses an **intraday matrix**, cycling through various timeframes.
    *   Five-minute, four-minute, three-minute, two-minute, one-minute, 45-second, 30-second, 15-second, five-second.
*   This matrix helps identify institutional order placement.
*   Example: Key levels indicate sell-side liquidity.
*   Rally and a shift in market structure anticipate buy-side liquidity.
*   A one-minute imbalance may not appear as a fair value gap, but overlaps with a 15-second chart.
*   The 15-second chart shows two down-closed candles, forming a bullish order block.
*   Price digs into the order block, rallies, and returns to it.
*   Order block and fair value gap confirmation allows for additional long positions.
*   The speaker scales into positions based on lower timeframe confirmations.
*   This is why the speaker may enter multiple times in the same area.
*   Dialing in with small, sub-one-minute contract sizes.
*   TradingView offers these lower timeframes (requires specific membership level).
*   The highest level membership is around $600/year, with potential discounts during Black Friday.
*   Investing in tools is crucial for precise trading.
*   Cannot rely solely on one-minute charts for everything taught by the speaker.

### **Efficiency, Rebalancing and Support/Resistance**

*   Same principles apply to the Silver Bullet setup.
*   Range is a one-minute fair value gap, but the 15-second chart shows a down-close candle (order block).
*   Going long at that order block.
*   Adding to the position if price drops to the shaded area on the 15-second chart.
*   Market rallies.
*   Looking at Inefficiency on the 15-second chart.
*   Pockets of one-candle price action indicate areas for rebalancing.
*   Repricing and rebalancing create efficient price delivery.
*   Efficient balance: up and down price delivery.
*   Once price leaves an efficiently balanced range, it shouldn't return.
*   If price rallies above a high after a balanced range, it shouldn't return below that high.
*   Inefficiencies around levels of support and resistance can provide trading opportunities.
*   If these inefficiencies are balanced (up and down price delivery) *before* price leaves the range, the level can be trusted as support or resistance.
*   This doesn't guarantee 100% accuracy.
*   If inefficiencies are *not* balanced, the support/resistance level is less reliable.
*   Example: Price trades back and forth within a level (balanced).
*   Once it leaves, it doesn't need to return until inefficiency is created and rebalanced.
*   Inefficiency creates a candle which goes up and down but does not move the price higher from where it started.
*   That is why the price only went right up to that to the tick two.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text. I have strived to maintain every detail, nuance, and the original speaker's tone while improving readability and structure.

## **Order Flow and ICT Silver Bullet: Advanced Analysis (PM Session)**

### **Consequent Encroachment and One-Minute Chart Analysis**

*   Price plummeted down to the **New Day Opening Gap** below.
*   Then, it moved into the **consequent encroachment of the Tuesday-Wednesday opening range Gap.** (Slightly to the right, outside the current fractal scope).
*   The following analysis is based on a **one-minute chart** focusing on the S&P afternoon session.
    *   Timeframe: **2:00 PM to 3:00 PM** (PM Session Silver Bullet).

### **Reaching Objectives and Identifying Inefficiencies**

*   Price rallied up and reached the objective: the **high-side liquidity pool.**
    *   This target was identified the previous night.
    *   Reached during the **2:00 PM hour**.
    *   Ran through it and then broke sharply lower, creating an **inefficiency**.
*   Market traded up into this inefficiency.
    *   Potential short opportunity for a Silver Bullet trade.
    *   Rationale: The buy-side liquidity objective was reached, followed by a breakdown.
*   Looking for this inefficiency, specifically a **real Gap** (or liquidity void).
    *   **This is a real liquidity void**: Where one candle stops, and the next starts, with no price data in between.
    *   **This is not a liquidity void**: Referring to other areas that lack the same distinct separation.
*   The inefficiency is a **fair value Gap** and a **SIBI (sell-side imbalance, buy-side inefficiency).**
    *   SIBI means lacking buy-side delivery; candles must move up in price within that range.
*   Price returns to this area, creating a potential short opportunity.
    *   Expectation: Price will decline back into this inefficiency and trade to that **real liquidity void**.
*   Price briefly moves higher again, not reaching the initial Silver Bullet fair value gap.
*   Breaks down again.
*   Another small gap forms, presenting a potential entry.
    *   However, caution is advised.
    *   While hindsight might make it seem like a viable entry, consider the broader context.
    *   Too close in proximity to recent highs; price might run above to take out buy-side liquidity without reaching the higher level.
*   Recommended approach:
    *   Drop to a lower timeframe to analyze the area higher up.
    *   Identify other potentially unseen fair value gaps on the one-minute chart.
*   Ultimately, the market breaks lower.
    *   Trades back down into the initial inefficiency.
    *   Rebalances price action at the real liquidity void.
    *   Trades down to **4160.75.**

### **Ten Handle Range and High Probability Shorting**

*   Question: Does this move offer a **10-handle (or 10-point) range** for potential high-probability shorting?
    *   The buy-side liquidity pool (previous target) was already hit.
    *   Occurred during the PM session (2:00 PM on a Thursday).
*   Observation: Thursdays often (but not always) provide the opposite end of the weekly range.
    *   Since the week has been bullish, Thursday could potentially form the high of the week.
    *   Trades are often shorter-term, leading to this type of movement.
*   Is there enough movement to be profitable?
*   Silver Bullet 10-handle range analysis:
    *   Short entry at the high of the candle (4169.00).
    *   Needs to print 4169.25 to account for the spread.
    *   The market moves more than that.
*   Annotation:
    *   Illustrative example, not a real trade.
    *   Useful for journaling and backtesting.
    *   Annotate where fills *would* have occurred.
    *   Quantify drawdown.
*   Do *not* try to pick the absolute highest high or lowest low.
    *   Unrealistic and won't make you a "super trader."
*   Be realistic and practical when backtesting.
    *   Annotate based on the rules and logic provided.
    *   Study with realistic expectations of drawdown.
*   In this example, entry incurs drawdown before moving lower.
*   Addressing potential thought process: Why not expect the price to completely close the gap?
    *   The preceding run targeted and achieved the buy-side liquidity target.
    *   The resulting gap represents a "blow-off" type move.
    *   Resembles capitulation.
    *   Not necessarily suggesting a confirmed high, but trading with that expectation.
    *   Analogous to a breakaway gap.
    *   This gap should not completely close in.
    *   Later price action confirms that some portion of the gap remains open.

### **Profitability and Trade Management**

*   Only need 10 handles to determine if the opportunity exists.
*   From a short entry at 4169.00 (candle high):
    *   10 handles lower is 4159.00.
    *   This target is below the current low.
    *   Therefore, a high-probability trade.
*   Strategies:
    *   Book five handles.
    *   Take a partial profit at ten handles.
    *   See if price moves down to close the inefficiency.
    *   Recommended: Aim for the real liquidity void and close the position there.
*   Potential to miss further downward movement, but prioritize securing profits.
*   Avoid engaging in subsequent price action.

### **Ten-Second Chart Analysis: Precision and Detail**

*   The analysis shifts to a **10-second chart**.
*   The inefficiency is visible as a single candle.
*   Potential fill area identified.
*   Quantify the potential "heat" (drawdown) incurred.
*   An up-close candle represents a **bearish order block**.
*   The market trades lower.
*   **Inefficiency not visible on the one-minute chart** is revealed.
    *   Fair value gap forms after a tick below a low.
    *   Price rallies back up into the order block.
*   Notice inefficiency.
*   Price moves sideways briefly.
*   Breaks down back into the high of the fair value gap.
*   Reprints lower.
*   The one-minute fair value gap is then respected.
*   Breakaway gap moves lower.
*   Digs into the real liquidity void.
*   Congestion is evident on the 10-second chart.
*   **This level of detail is not discernible on a simple one-minute chart.**

### **Insight and Anticipation**

*   The speaker has these levels annotated and sees them without having them visually on the chart.
*   Constantly referring to key levels while watching price action.
    *   Example: The 4160.75 level (high of the Wednesday-Thursday opening range Gap).
*   Anticipating how price will react at these levels.
*   Expecting retracement when price reaches these levels or PD arrays.
*   If an inefficiency forms, expecting price to retrace back up into it.
*   Using this anticipation to identify high probability exits.
*   Exit strategy: When price trades into the real liquidity void (separation between candles).

### **Detail and Profitability**

*   This level of detail may not be gleaned from a simple one-minute chart.
*   This level of detail is not *needed* to be profitable.
*   This level of detail is not *needed* to find Silver Bullet trades that work.
*   The speaker finds trades that *won't* exist in a one-minute chart by using sub one minute charts.
*   This level of detail is optional and dependent on individual comfort levels.

### **Sub-Minute Candlesticks and Algorithmic Trading**

*   Just because the speaker does it doesn't mean you have to do it too.
*   All these methods work.
*   Not twisting your arm to trade intraday.
*   Intraday trading gives more examples and opportunities to present things that would take longer to manifest on higher time frame daily and weekly charts.
*   Fits the speaker's personality.
*   Comfortable with making high frequency decisions.
*   High frequency trading is done on these sub one minute candlesticks.
*   These candlesticks are using these types of inefficiencies in points of reference for their algorithm.
*   They're only shorting when the market goes up.
*   They're only going long when the market goes down.
*   They're reading inside of all this.
*   Just because it's doing all these fair value gaps here, it doesn't mean anything.
*   Just because it went up to this order block here, it doesn't mean anything.
*   The move targeted buy-side liquidity (the identified target).
*   Aggressive break down below the high (blue line).
*   Overshoots inefficiency on the 10-second chart.
*   Digs down into the volume imbalance (no bodies overlapping, just the wick).

### **Three Drives Pattern and Trade Management**

*   Runs back up into the one-minute fair value gap three times (classic "three drives" pattern).
*   Breaks lower, creating an inefficiency (potential short).
*   Stop-loss placement: above the recent high.
*   Potential scenario: stop-out, then further price movement.
*   If stopped out, wait for a similar pattern to occur later.
*   Short on a break and the creation of another fair value gap.

### **Greater Degree of Precision**

*   Taught a greater degree of precision and why the speaker does his entries where you see him entering them on a one minute chart or a five minute chart.
*   May not seem logical to you.
*   The speaker is looking at these lower one minute and less charts.
*   The speaker is looking at all the inefficiencies, the order blocks, the point of reference that I'm showing you here.
*   There's just an introduction to it.
*   Every PD array that the speaker has taught plus the ones that he will never teach you he is looking for them.
*   You don't need all that stuff.
*   The speaker can teach you how to do this but you have to be willing to listen.
*   You have to go into the charts and look for it.
*   Silver bullets are simply fair value gaps that exist inside of a 60 Minute window.
*   There's not a one-trick pony to Silver Bullet.
*   There's a lot of ways to get into a silver bullet trade.
*   There's more than one Silver Bullet forming.
*   There's always one forming.
*   If you might look at the chart and say it didn't form, you didn't look at these time frames.
*   They're every day every single day between 10 o'clock and 11 and between two o'clock and three o'clock and between three o'clock and four o'clock during the London session every single day.
*   You have to know where it's drawing to.
*   We were expecting it to draw above to get the buy side here.
*   Once it's done that, what are we expecting?
*   It's probably going to pull back and offer some measure of retracement that's reasonable and it gives it.
*   That's all you need.
*   You need movement, it doesn't offer you 10 handles.
*   If you're trying to get five handles which is what the model teaches this is how you get it every single day.
*   The speaker will lose sometimes.
*   The speaker will get stopped out sometimes.
*   If the speaker gets stopped out and the criteria still existing in the price charts and nothing really changed he just had a run of poor execution on his stop placement or maybe his execution entry wasn't as pristine as he'd like it to be and he gets stopped out.
*   If the trade still is viable he will re-enter and you've seen him do that also in his execution videos.
*   If the trade still exists in the framework and the logic is still there, look for the next signal to get in on it.
*   You don't need to chase it, just gonna lose one minute or less time frames and wait for your setup.

### **Trade Setups**

*   Think about it like this.
*   If the speaker saw this order block say for instance he would look at this area here and he hadn't been in front of the charts until there and he sees the order block.
*   He would want to see it reject that it does so we create this little Fair bag gut right there when it ran up into it there and it's the high that the speaker said he would only see the buy side taken on that right there is an entry for the speaker.
*   He doesn't need to be in it here.
*   He doesn't need to be in it over here.
*   He could be in it right there and that's not chasing price.
*   He could be using this order block right here because we haven't even taken up this low right here.
*   We have an up close candle, this is all during 10 seconds.
*   The speaker is watching all this stuff.
*   This up close candle when we traded away from it and came up into it here as this candle is hitting it he can be short right there and his stop would be above the Fairbank Gap candle here right there his stop will be right there that's Ultra tight.
*   The speaker could pyramid more.
*   He could be shorting here pyramiding more here because he hasn't taken out a structured low that would see acceleration for his trade and he's way down here before he gets to his target.
*   In the scheme of things he's entering here and his targets here so this is inception this is terminus midpoint or equilibrium is right here.
*   The speaker can absolutely take this trade because it's above equilibrium or still in a short term premium.

### **Institutional Order Flow and Market Dynamics**

*   Institutional order flow.
*   Has nothing to do with volume profile has nothing to do with level two data Doms depth of Market none of that stuff you don't need any of that stuff.
*   You do need to know where price is drawing to where is it going to next it's going there for stops or it's going there because it needs to reprice and re-deliver where inefficiency exists that's it that's all it's doing.
*   If it's not going to do either one of those things that's what it's going to do it's going to go sideways and you can't make money in that there it is.
*   That's going to be it for this week hopefully you've learned something this week and enjoy your weekend be safe and I'll touch base with you again on Tuesday until talk to you then be safe.

# Stream Introduction and Housekeeping

## Audio and Video Check

*   The speaker begins by checking the audio and video quality with the audience via Twitter, requesting a "5x5" confirmation.
*   He notes that the volume may be too loud and adjusts accordingly.

## Stream Overview

*   The speaker outlines the plan to cover a few topics and potentially review live price action, depending on time constraints and market conditions.
*   He emphasizes that reviewing live price action is not guaranteed.

## ICT Mentorship 2023 Playlist

*   New viewers should follow the **ICT Mentorship 2023 playlist** on YouTube for all related content (live streams and lectures).

# Guidance for New Viewers

## Starting Point: 2022 ICT Mentorship Playlist

*   For newcomers to the channel, the speaker advises starting with the **2022 ICT Mentorship playlist**, which consists of 41 videos.
*   He suggests that the first video is optional but "sets the tone."

## Direct Approach: Focusing on Brass Tacks

*   The speaker acknowledges his long-winded style, driven by a desire to provide comprehensive understanding and value.
*   He clarifies that his teaching aims for the "highest form of understanding," requiring patience and attention to detail.
*   Those with short attention spans or lacking interest in fully understanding the rationale behind risk-taking may struggle.
*   He highlights the importance of educator passion because student results reflect the educator's ability to communicate logic effectively.
*   The goal is to provide as much detail as possible, rather than simplistic "buy/sell signal" approaches with static examples.

## Importance of Subtle Variances in Price Action

*   The speaker emphasizes the subtle nuances in price action delivery, particularly crucial for those new to trading or accustomed to a "retail perspective."
*   The "retail perspective" refers to conventional wisdom found in books, courses, and regurgitated content within the industry.
*   He acknowledges that his content can be overwhelming because it challenges preconceived notions.

## Challenge to the Audience

*   The speaker challenges viewers to independently verify his teachings by examining charts.
*   He expresses confidence that diligent effort will validate his concepts.

# The 2022 Model: A Streamlined Approach

## Designed for Simplicity and Time-Based Learning

*   The 2022 playlist represents a streamlined model designed with simplicity in mind, created initially for his daughter.
*   The model is time-based to address common questions about setup timing and trading sessions.

## Applicability Across Markets

*   The model, which focuses on liquidity runs, market structure shifts, and fair value gaps, can be applied to:
    *   Forex
    *   Futures contracts (index and currency)
    *   Crypto (according to students, although the speaker doesn't trade it)

*   The speaker **does not** trade:
    *   Crypto himself
    *   Synthetic indices (e.g., volatility index, particularly common in Africa)

## Validation Through Student Success

*   The speaker notes that the model is being successfully applied by students in the marketplace.
*   He frequently shares student examples and results on Twitter.

## Funding and Profitability

*   Anecdotal evidence suggests that a significant portion of profitable payouts from funded trading companies comes from his student base.
*   The speaker believes that the 2022 model bridges the gap between uncertainty and consistent profitability.

## Charter Member Experience

*   The model mirrors the approach used with charter members (those who paid for one-on-one instruction), involving daily chart analysis and explanation of expected price action.
*   He claims a high accuracy rate (in the high 90s) observed over years by thousands, now hundreds of thousands, of people.

## Versatility Across Timeframes

*   The model can be used on intraday and higher timeframe charts.

## Lower Timeframe Charts

*   The speaker acknowledges requests to move away from lower intraday charts (e.g., 1- and 5-minute charts), understanding that many viewers cannot or prefer not to trade them.
*   However, he uses these shorter timeframes to provide numerous examples, demonstrating consistency and continuity in analysis and results.

## Monotony as a Goal

*   The speaker emphasizes that the goal of a trader should be to achieve boring, monotonous consistency, similar to routine tasks at a regular job.
*   The 2022 model is presented as the simplest and most effective way to achieve this.
*   Even newcomers have achieved funding and payouts using the model.

# Trading Advice and Expectations

## Caution Against Early Live Trading

*   The speaker discourages live trading in the first year of learning.
*   This is because there are many aspects of price action and one's own psychology that need to be understood.
*   Rushing into live trading, even with funded accounts, can hinder success.

## Importance of Hard Work and Dedication

*   The speaker emphasizes that successful traders (e.g., six-figure earners) have invested significant time and effort.
*   He mentions specific examples of successful students:
    *   One student made $300,000 in three months.
    *   Another student, Jade, is making half a million dollars.
    *   Paladin is also mentioned as being successful.

## Market Dynamics and Liquidity

*   The speaker reassures viewers that the market algorithm will not change drastically due to increased adoption of his content.
*   The markets have always behaved in this manner, and increased participation will likely lead to more efficient liquidity.

## Liquidity Hunting vs. Retail Mindset

*   The speaker contrasts his approach of "harvesting liquidity" with the "retail mindset."
*   He states that retail traders rely on things like moving average crossovers, which can be profitable but are often exploited.
*   His approach focuses on hunting liquidity and preying on retail logic.

## Learning from Initial Mistakes

*   The speaker recounts his own early struggles with retail trading, specifically buying oversold oscillators in bear markets.
*   He learned the hard way that markets can remain oversold for extended periods, leading to losses.

## Unconventional Teaching Approach

*   The speaker aims to communicate insights not typically found elsewhere, translating them into chart-based interpretations.
*   He acknowledges that the driving forces behind price movements are not always visible on charts.
*   Despite the difficulty, he strives to bridge the gap between these external factors and repeatable chart patterns.

# Key Concepts and Tools

## Multipliers (Entry Triggers)

*   The speaker introduces the concept of "multipliers," which are specific entry triggers used to initiate trades.
*   These include:
    *   My order block
    *   Fair value gaps (inversion or standard)
    *   Institutional order entry drill
    *   Optimal trade entry
    *   Propulsion block

## PD Array Matrix

*   The speaker refers to the **PD Array Matrix**, taught in the core content (likely month four), as a relatively easy way to communicate using time-based charts.
*   He hints at other, more complex PD arrays that do not require charts, but deems them too complicated for current discussion.

## Intuitive Trading

*   The speaker claims he can sometimes predict market movements without even looking at a chart, relying on algorithmic understanding.
*   However, he focuses on teaching methods that rely on visually recognizable, repeatable patterns.

## Building Experience Through Practice and Backtesting

*   He reiterates the importance of studying the 2022 model and spending time with it through practice and backtesting (reviewing past chart movements).
*   This builds the necessary experience for confident decision-making.

# Swing Trading and Psychology

## Quarterly Shifts

*   The speaker mentions that he teaches quarterly shifts in the core content, referring to major intermediate-term price swings on daily and weekly charts.

## Psychology

*   He highlights the importance of psychological awareness when trading.
*   He talks about how if you're under a lot of stress, not feeling well, or have had a loss, it's important to stay away from trading.
*   Trading is important to stay away from the charts because you're going to be hurting in that pain that discomfort that boredom can even you know spurt on you're going to do something impulsively.

## Trading While Distracted

*   He shares his personal experience of being unable to focus due to emotional distress related to a sick pet.
*   He also acknowledges the similar experiences of viewers dealing with breakups, illnesses, or job loss.

## The Operator's Role

*   Even with superior concepts, the speaker emphasizes that the trader ("the operator") plays a crucial role.
*   An unstable emotional state (hurt, fatigue, etc.) can lead to poor decision-making, impulsive actions, and a need to be right, ultimately sabotaging success.
*   Trading should not be used as a coping mechanism or a way to feel better.

## Anticipation vs. Reaction

*   He reiterates the importance of anticipating price movements rather than reacting to them.

## Responsibility and Ownership

*   He concludes by stressing that viewers have a significant responsibility in their trading journey.
*   Success is solely attributable to the individual, but failures must also be owned.
*   He does not endorse failures resulting from poor emotional control or a lack of focus.


# Market Review and Analysis

## Dollar Index Analysis (Weekly Chart)

*   The speaker refers to the dollar index on a weekly chart.
*   He mentioned in previous market reviews that the index would likely reach the halfway point of the last up-close candle before a rotation lower.
*   The initial draw was anticipated to be the order block's opening price, denoted on the chart.
*   Price expanded upwards from that level.
*   The gap was expected to act as an **inversion fair value gap (IFVG)**.
*   The speaker cautions against prematurely shorting based solely on the gap and relative equal lows, emphasizing the need for logic and narrative.
*   Concerns regarding the U.S. debt ceiling, potential default, and global war scenarios are catalysts for a "flight to quality" or safe haven.
*   The U.S. dollar is still considered a safe haven, though its influence may be waning.
*   A higher dollar typically correlates with lower foreign currencies.
*   The speaker aims to discuss Forex pairs, including EUR/USD, but starts with the dollar index to assess risk-on/risk-off sentiment.

## Identifying Key Levels and Draw on Liquidity

*   If the dollar is expected to rise, it's crucial to identify specific target levels, not broad zones.
*   The last up-close candle has three important levels: the low, the opening price, and the **mean threshold** (halfway point from high to low).
*   Previously, the speaker indicated a target of the mean threshold of that order block.
*   There was no explicit short signal for the dollar itself, but rather a focus on lower prices for EUR/USD.

## Current Market Action and Student Application

*   Price ran up into the identified level last week.
*   The current weekly candlestick shows the gap acting as support intra-week, as well as during the previous week.
*   A lower timeframe (daily) chart provides more impactful insights.
*   The speaker addresses followers who seek immediate predictions, urging them to analyze the information provided and apply the **2022 model** to lower timeframes, individual sessions, and daily candles.
*   Waiting for the speaker's updates without independent analysis is a disservice to one's learning process.
*   Success depends largely (90%) on individual effort and application.
*   Simply watching videos is insufficient; active engagement and practice are essential.
*   The speaker states his expectation for the dollar to move higher, however reminds the audience not to bet the farm.
*   He also reminds the audience that it takes time to learn and patience is needed to do so.

## Daily Chart Analysis and Order Block Clarification

*   The inversion fair value gap formed, and price rotated up into a daily bearish order block.
*   A bearish order block does not necessarily need to be an engulfing candle, despite common misconceptions.
*   The speaker critiques those offering pseudo-mentorships based on incomplete or inaccurate understandings.
*   The market rotation after hitting a key level is used to identify the last candle, which doesn't require engulfing.
*   The speaker emphasizes responsible teaching and avoiding the fleecing of students.
*   When a candle has a short tail or wick, the opening price is generally used as the key level for the order block.
*   This is because the lower timeframe likely contains elements that can be used for support or resistance, even if price moves slightly beyond the opening price.
*   If the candle has a longer tail, the low and the consequent encroachment (midpoint) of that wick are used.
*   These insights about order blocks are shared to aid viewers in their studies.

## Weekly vs. Daily Order Blocks and Price Encapsulation

*   The speaker draws attention to the weekly and daily order blocks, highlighting the encapsulation of price action within the candlestick bodies.
*   Sustained price runs occurred on the buy-side, with infrequent down-closed candles (on the daily timeframe).
*   Price opened, traded away, expanded through levels, and ultimately fell short of the mean threshold of the weekly order block.
*   Annotation of levels on charts is emphasized.

## Mean Threshold and Fair Value Gap Confirmation

*   After piercing the mean threshold of the weekly order block at 104.540, price rotated lower.
*   The price rotated back to the weekly inversion gap, or fair value gap, and found support as anticipated.
*   Defining specific PD array levels (e.g., the high, consequent encroachment, and low of a fair value gap) removes ambiguity compared to supply and demand zones.
*   He also notes that everything from ICT is fresh, and says that his students are always making fresh bread and don't run out of yeast just like him.
*   His students can find setups and succeed in any market and any timeframe.
*   The audience needs to embrace what the speaker is teaching in order to be successful.
*   He emphasizes where price is trying to go, driving home where the price is trying to gravitate to.
*   The speaker initially starts with the weekly order block, then the daily and the mean threshold of that weekly order block.

## Applicability Across Timeframes and Market Conditions

*   The analysis, initially based on weekly charts, is also applicable to daily charts.
*   The methods work in EUR/USD (Forex).
*   The techniques work across multiple assets including Forex, Futures, Commodities, Gold and Bonds.
*   Higher timeframes are emphasized for their clarity and ability to filter out noise, especially for newer traders.
*   Lower timeframes can create mirages and phantom setups.
*   The speaker took time away (road trips) when the market conditions were messy.
*   A shift in market structure is needed to make things more visible.

## Fair Value Gaps and Draw on Liquidity

*   The speaker notes that now we are going to talk about gaps today, especially Breakaway Gaps and when fair value gaps shouldn't fill.
*   When seeking a draw on liquidity, the initial focus should be on imbalances, such as the shaded area on the chart.
*   The analysis and strategies being discussed apply equally to Forex, Futures, commodities, gold, and bonds.
*   The speaker believes that spending more time on higher timeframes is more impactful.
*   He jokes about how people might think everything can be applied to any time frame.
*   He advises that you don't want to fill your well with sand by chasing setups that are not there (Phantoms).

## Weekly Chart Recap

*   Returning to the weekly chart to review the shaded area and its significance.
*   He likes to be complete and doesn't like to leave anything up for debate.
*   The area between the low of one candle and the high of another represents a distinct gap separation, followed by expansion lower.
*   He points out the gap between those two key levels there and then expansion lower.
*   He notes that they open trade up leaving this...


# Market Review and Analysis (Continued)

## Inefficient Price Action and Fair Value Gaps

*   The speaker highlights a **"little portion of price action"** between specific candles, noting that the low of one candle and the high of another remains open.
*   This area represents **"sell side imbalance, buy side inefficiency" (SIBI)**.
*   The speaker acknowledges potentially misspeaking, clarifying it as **"sell side imbalance, buy side inefficiency (SIBI)"**.
*   This **"little distinct Gap"** stands out when viewed from the right side of the price action.
*   He contrasts this with the **fortified back-and-forth movements** in other areas, describing them as not inefficient.
*   The analogy of applying paint with a roller is used:
    *   In the areas with back-and-forth movement, paint (price) has been distributed repeatedly.
    *   In the shaded area, price only has **"one roll down, never up"**, indicating inefficiency.

## Fair Value Gap as a Draw on Liquidity

*   The **fair value gap** served as a draw on liquidity.
*   The context was an expectation for price to trade up through the gap, then come down and act as support, thus becoming an **inversion fair value gap (IFVG)**.
*   Without this expectation, it would be treated as a standard fair value gap in a **premium** relative to the high and low.
*   To determine premium vs. discount:
    *   Use a **Fibonacci retracement** tool anchored from high to low.
    *   If the fair value gap exists at or above equilibrium, it's a premium.
    *   If it's at or below equilibrium, it's a discount.
*   The speaker reiterates he was *not* looking for lower prices when price reached this fair value gap; he wanted to see it trade *through* it and treat it as support.

## Cross-Referencing and Language Considerations

*   Viewers are encouraged to review previous market analyses and Twitter spaces for confirmation.
*   A disclaimer is given about potentially using **"blue collar language"** (cussing) in Twitter spaces, particularly when not using candlestick charts.
*   The speaker states that his "imbalance inside" makes him not the best mentor for those that are sensitive to such language.
*   The speaker states that the little gap is what he's segmenting.

## Lower Timeframe Analysis and Weekly vs. Daily Charts

*   Moving to the daily chart reveals a different perspective.
*   The initial gap may not appear as a gap on the daily chart due to back-and-forth movement.
*   Important: Do not assume that back-and-forth moves on a daily chart negate the inefficiency present on the weekly chart.
*   Even with daily candles working within the range, the weekly timeframe remains inefficient.
*   The higher timeframe (weekly) is the parent, and the lower timeframe (daily) is subordinate, behaving within the context of the higher timeframe's imbalances or liquidity pools.
*   The speaker is seeing the formation of the weekly fair value gap and notes that all of the price movement within that level on the daily timeframe is something you must study on your own.

## Market Dynamics: Liquidity and Inefficiencies

*   Markets move up to a premium for two reasons:
    *   To take buy stops.
    *   To address some inefficiency or gap.
*   Markets move down for two reasons:
    *   To address an inefficiency (fair value gap) below current market price.
    *   To seek sell stops.
*   The speaker dismisses the notion that markets move based on indicators or buying/selling pressure.
*   He believes markets are controlled and that these perspectives regarding buying and selling pressure are not what is going on.

## Weekly Fair Value Gap: A Key Level

*   The speaker questions the use of the fair value gap.
*   The fair value gap is a key level on the daily chart, using the dealing range from low to high.
*   Using Fibonacci retracements is important.
*   If waiting for the price to gravitate to that level, one wants to see how it performs.
*   He prefers that price does not go up to it and sharply break lower.
*   If this happens, a drop to a lower timeframe to look for a fair value gap or something else on a short-term premium to sell short is required.

## Geopolitical Factors and Market Uncertainty

*   Geopolitical turmoil, economic factors, and overall uncertainty influence market behavior.
*   These conditions favor a scenario where a PD array acts as a draw on liquidity, drawing up to the weekly fair value gap.
*   The speaker wants to see this do something other than just go up into it and treat it as an area to sell short from.
*   He wants to see it go through it.

## Disqualifying Fair Value Gaps

*   The speaker refers to instances where he taught how to discard or disqualify a fair value gap in live streams.
*   This may appear as cherry-picking to some, but it's based on logic and experience.
*   The speaker says he is sharing his experience so that viewers can look back at previous lessons and apply the logic.
*   This fair value gap was the initial draw on liquidity, and the market structure shifted above a short-term high, signaling a buy program.

## Identifying Premium Arrays

*   With the market in a buy program, the focus shifts to premium arrays.
*   The dealing range is defined as the high to low, and the interest is in premium.
*   Short-term highs are not viewed as turtle soup runs for shorting; the focus is on the first equilibrium or higher PD array.
*   Top-down analysis is emphasized, mirroring the approach of large institutions using higher timeframe charts.
*   They cannibalize long-term models.
*   The long-term model was bearish, so they are looking inside the scope of the High to that low.
*   The midpoint is in the shaded area, which is the weekly inversion fair value gap, the first level of interest.

## Contextual Understanding and Market Signals

*   Context is crucial for understanding the speaker's expectations for this specific weekly point of interest.
*   He wants to see price trade to it and through it.
*   If a market closes above a fair value gap expected to be bearish, it signals that it may become an inversion fair value gap.
*   A close above a fair value gap means that it is communicating to you that it will become an inversion fair value gap.
*   The penny just dropped.
*   He emphasizes precise trading, independent chart reading, and logical understanding for consistent success.

## Analogies and Objectives

*   The speaker compares market analysis to knowing multiple routes to work, with occasional detours requiring recalibration (like a GPS rerouting).
*   The objective remains the same: the weekly order block is the draw on liquidity, and the inversion fair value gap is the multiplier.
*   He reviews and asks if his expectations of "get to and through it" are being satisfied.

## Grading a Price Swing

*   He is now going into grading a price swing.
*   The speaker defends his teaching method, emphasizing that understanding is a gradual process.
*   Charter members can readily grasp these concepts due to their experience.
*   The speaker is reminding the viewers where they are making the mistakes, not that he is making the mistakes.
*   The speaker cautions against impulsively trading based solely on his statements, as there's ample room for error.
*   Inexperienced traders may get caught in unexpected retracements and conclude the system doesn't work.
*   He is telling them to be careful.
*   However, as previously stated, the speaker is going to point out that the levels that he talks about do indeed get hit.

## Importance of Experience and Patience

*   Between the market structure shift and the weekly bearish order block mean threshold, there's a crucial level: the mean threshold itself.
*   That level is the halfway point between the high and the low.
*   Emphasizing that the market structure shift and the weekly bearish order block mean threshold is not anything in this fractal of any importance.
*   The speaker notes the FIB at 104.540 is half of that.
*   The speaker says he will drop back to the daily chart.

## Daily Chart Analysis and Dealing Ranges

*   A market structure shift occurred, resulting in a fair value gap.
*   The speaker clarifies that this is not based on quarters theory.
*   The speaker notes that he was doing this before quarter stories was even a thing.
*   Grading a price swing requires knowing the draw on liquidity, the terminus (end of the line), and the anticipated price target.
*   This doesn't necessarily mean the price stops and reverses there, but it's where the setup forms.
*   The dealing range is always framed from past high to low, and the equilibrium price point is aimed for a premium.
*   This is because one wants to see it trade into this fair value Gap and above it, which would nullify it would remove any need to anticipate lower prices on dollar.
*   When this happens it signals to you algorithmically that it is not going to go lower it in fact wants to go higher.
*   If it does this, it increases the opportunity for the fair value gap to be inversion for Vega.
*   The inversion for Vega means it's going to act as resistance broken, which turns into support.
*   The speaker warns against rushing into live trading without understanding these rules, as it can lead to losses.
*   The speaker says if you are slow in making money and fast in trying to preserve or keep it those two modes of thought or conducting you know a daily routine.
*   Move very very slow when you're trying to make money because there's lots of opportunities to do that.
*   The speaker iterates that the opportunities to capitalize are specific and available every day, every week, every session.
*   He says you can trade one hour candles and treat it just like this whole idea that he has shown on the basis of that Weekly Candlestick.
*   All this stuff is applicable inside of a 60 Minute candle.
*   It all exists there, it's a tiny little universe within that one time frame.
*   The speaker notes that you can break these things down smaller and smaller and smaller but you don't have the experience yet and you have to give yourself the time.


Here's the provided text, reorganized and formatted for improved readability and clarity, with every detail preserved.

# Gaining Experience, Confidence, and Avoiding Ego

*   Gaining experience is essential for building confidence.
*   However, be cautious that confidence does not evolve into egomaniac attention.
*   The speaker reflects on his own experience in his 20s, admitting that this kind of stuff made him feel Superior to everybody and he communicated that always.
*   He notes that now he doesn't even know if his stuff is superior and doesn't view himself in a manner where he has to go out there and stay and prove it.
*   He doesn't have to do that anymore because he has students now that are doing it.

## Market Structure Shift and Buy Programs

*   The speaker is looking forward to this price range.
*   If there's a shift in Market structure here on this candle, that moment will indicate the entry into a buy program.
*   Once a buy program is identified, one must go back into this range and anchor it to where price is anticipated to go.
*   The initial draw on liquidity was here; this was anchored on the daily chart.
*   The speaker wants to see if the price wants to get up into that.
*   All of this run here could be sitting still anticipating, not reacting, anticipating a run above that short-term High here.

### Addressing High/Low Selection Queries

*   The speaker acknowledges questions of why he's wanting this high.
*   Why not use this High, why not use that high.
*   Why not that High, Low, lower low, lower low.

### Market Consolidation and Observation

*   Consolidation occurred all through April and May.
*   The speaker expresses the desire for the market to show him something.
*   He wanted to see it move out of this range.
*   Let's ring in the bond market.

## Bond Market Analysis

*   A short video commentary was posted on Twitter or on the YouTube channel.
*   During this consolidation, the speaker wanted to see the market perform in a specific way.
*   He wanted to see it show him something all through here.
*   He wanted to see the dollar go lower and expected it to take out that low.
*   However, because it was showing unwillingness to perform or show any willingness to go lower, he didn't trust it.
*   When we don't want to take a trade when there's something in the price action that says don't do anything, here we have this Low right there.
*   There was a little Pierce below it right there, a little tiny little short move below that Low right there.
*   It could have very easily traded back up to this level and then resumed.
*   If it would have done that, then the dollar really would have embarrassed longer term.
*   Because it consolidated, the speaker wanted to see if there was confirmation through the bond market.
*   All this consolidation is going to be shown in the bond market.
*   Daily chart for **zbm2023** (symbol for bonds).
    *   It's not the month that you should be trading or tracking it now.
    *   Its volume has rotated into the September contract.
*   To understand how the dollar is likely to perform, the bond market is used.

### Market Complexity and Viewer Retention

*   Some viewers prefer simple explanations, but this is where most of you drop off because you know you're like oh this is complicated that's how you feel folks don't watch my videos.
*   Viewers will either be successful elsewhere or return to learn how markets really work.
*   The speaker wanted to see if the bond market would perform in a mirror image of what the dollar was doing.
*   The bond market **zbm2023** was in a Range.
*   The speaker wanted to see it go down into a discount.
*   If the buy Market goes down on a discount, that would result in the dollar Index moving into a premium.
*   Here's that range.
*   We were in this range, and until this range was given up until it left this range dollar wasn't doing anything equities were going to range mount.
*   That's why the speaker stayed out taking RV road trips.
*   He doesn't care about the price action when it's in here like this.
*   Can I trade that absolutely, can you trade it absolutely, but to meet a expectation in the community that's been craving higher time frame charts swing trading ideas.
*   Can you do something off the women in charts.
*   The speaker is always talking about the one minute charts because it gives him lots of teaching examples where I can call it before it happens and it pans out precisely and that is where you should study whether you trade them or not you should study those lower time frames because you're getting so much experience by using lower time frame charts because it's not noise like the Goldman Sachs boys will tell you.
*   There's absolutely a rhyming reason why prices listen.
*   Is it a different price if you're looking at the bond market, Bitcoin, gold, whatever it is, whatever asset you're looking at.
*   Is price looking at a market price differently if you're looking at it on a daily chart or a one minute chart.
*   If you were looking at right now, if you're looking at the bond market right here, this is this is live, it's not delayed data right now the price is showing at 127 and 12 30 seconds, that's what it's showing right now.
*   If I drop down into a one minute chart look at that holy crow it's the same price, so don't listen to these goobers that'll tell you, you know there's noise on the lower time frames.
*   You're looking at the same price price is doing the same thing in all time frames but the narrative as to what it's going to do next.
*   Hello is going to be derived from what time frame you're using.
*   Right now in layman's terms, I'll say it like this, it's going to behave in a manner that the higher time frame outlines.
*   This is right now, this is price action on the June contract for bonds, as you can see it's real spotty.
*   If you use ZB, I'll come back to the daily chart in a second, I just want to make a point.
*   That's the symbol that's being shown right here **zbm2023**, the m is the Futures Contract month code for June.
*   All the volume is rotated into now the September contract so that is going to be the U symbol watch how all these little dots become much more smoother, see that that tells you that all the volume and open interest is now rotated early in the bond market.
*   S p the June contract is still favored but it will be changing here shortly now let's go back out to a daily chart for bonds and I'll tell you what I was doing and what I was thinking and I gotta go to the June contract because that's what was being traded in April and May.

## Bond Market Insights (June Contract)

*   Here is the business on the bonds we're in this range.
*   The speaker wanted to see this break that range.
*   He anticipated a breakout.
*   The speaker wants to see it leave this; this is Market profile.
*   There are no volume bars to the right of the chart; the speaker doesn't use that because it's Mickey Mouse stuff.
*   However, if viewers make money with it, God bless you.
*   That idea doesn't make markets go up and down though; market profiles to me is a schematic, it's a behavior a graph.
*   If you go into my core content on my YouTube channel, which was premium content people had paid money for that those lessons are the language that my students had to understand when I was doing you know live educations and Analysis every day every single day I was doing analysis and I was on the spot every single day calling every single day what it should perform.
*   Where was this bad this mad rush of people coming out and saying ICT is a fraud he can't do this stuff I'm paying him he didn't call that right it never happened.
*   If anybody's gonna expose me it would have been those individuals that paid me.
*   You're seeing the testimony again it's happening in front of you I'm teaching you the logic you're getting it right from the source.
*   I needed this range here to leave.
*   The speaker didn't care if it was going to go higher or lower because he didn't know at the time which one to trust.
*   Remember on The Daily dollar Index, I wanted to see that low taken out, that's what I wanted but I had to submit myself to what price was showing me it was not willing to go there yet.
*   The speaker had to take a step back and wait.

### The Elephant in the Swimming Pool Analogy

*   The speaker has 30 years experience, which gave him the insights to say sit still bro sit down this dance ain't for you sit down wait let the elephant enter that swimming pool.
*   Think about a children's swimming pool okay A little tiny little swimming pool if they swimming pool the size of a child use if you filled it up with water and an elephant came over and sat down in it what would happen to the water it would be displaced right it would it would leave the pool being replaced with the the mass of that elephant.
*   Smart money is like that in this range here right here when we saw it close right there outside that range that sets the stage for up move in dollar.
*   The speaker has to wait for something.
*   This is Wednesday May 17th.

## Dollar Index Analysis (May 17th)

*   Here is May 173 there okay lo and behold that's the day that the dollar Index is trading inside of its fair value Gap right there after post the shift in Market structure.
*   This High broke to the upside how can we qualify that as a shift in Market structure for the dollar to keep going higher.
*   Are we seeing a mirror image that would constitute a expectation for the bond market to enter a sell program it means bonds going down dollar going up.
*   We're in a consolidation we're in uncertainty here so I have to wait.
*   When this happened okay all focus goes to the sphere Vega but now I don't want to see it go up here to go short.
*   All this stuff that's happening in the other side of the world.
*   All that uncertainty the debt ceiling the potential default all that stuff was a catalyst from a macro perspective which is why the speaker didn't believe that that fair value Gap would be a short.
*   If it would have went up there and started to sell off, the speaker would use a lower time frame four hour one hour chart short of you know a premium like that and get in sync and then run for these lows here but the context that I went into and I shared with you was I wanted to see that Weekly fair value Gap trade above it and come down and treat it as support.
*   This is the daily chart for the dollar Index look where the bodies on the lower end of that Gap look where the bodies were was that not respecting that Weekly Gap that's not supplying demand that's not support resistance.
*   This is algorithmic It's referring back to a level I drew your attention to beforehand.
*   There's logic there that means there's something going on in price delivery that is well beyond buy and selling pressure it's rigged.

## Market Rigging and Opportunity

*   There shouldn't be any reason for you to be upset about that it shouldn't scare you you should be thankful.
*   You should be thankful that they rigged these markets because that presents the opportunity that as long as you're in sync with what it's likely to do next well guess what there's a 90 likelihood that new Traders will lose their money in the first 90 days or less that's a statistic.
*   On the other side of their trades there are people with lots of experience that know what they're doing they're the winner of those losing trades that the losing crowd loses to.
*   There's a buyer and seller for every trade it's a net sum zero game but the game is rigged.
*   There's no reason for you to be mad about it start punching the air that's the reason why that broker did it to me the broker didn't do anything to you unless you're trading Forex because they they have individual liquidity pools when you're trading futures you're all getting the same price that's the that's the it's a gentleman's Market.
*   If you want to be a Savage you trade Forex and when it's wild it moves around that's why I left Futures because you know in the 2000s it was why we have really big wide price ranges and 300 range days on the on the regular well that dried up and the market started getting real Consolidated so I went back to what I started with which is index futures I don't care if the s p trades with a five handle day and I said that correctly I don't care if the s p traded a five handle day folks that's exactly what we were looking at in the 90s that that type of stuff in the in the early 80s and such those days that was like the normal you didn't have this wild crazy volatility it's great don't get me wrong but if things got so slow and down to a snails crawl in Pace that's okay you can still do all those things and there's very small little ranges it'll just look like what the charts look like now but the amount of movement will be much much more condensed and a lot of you aren't even prepared to trade in a market like that because you're so used and you're baptized in all this High volatility when Forex shrank up and all the pairs had smaller ranges social media it was constant bellyaching oh man when's the big days coming Wednesday but it's moving.
*   If you can get 10 handles or 10 Pips from a price swing that's good.
*   What's wrong with that what's wrong with if if you just got five Pips who cares that the range is really small but you have to have your expectation calibrated to what the market profile is right now.
*   That means we're in consolidation I need to see what I need to see bonds leave because bonds will qualify whatever the dollar is going to do I'm gonna do a mirror image of it so bonds broke lower that means this is qualified as a break in Market structure and it shifted higher fair value guy right there.

## Forex Trading Insights

*   Let's play Devil's Advocate and say for a moment because this is a daily chart and this is the dollar Index by the way so if you're a Forex Trader this is the gold mine that you want to be in okay this is where you want to be mining these things from ICT the things that you think is boring other people say it's this is the stuff that makes you wealthy this is the stuff that finds constant consistency and continuity in trading longevity you want to be around for a little while longer than a couple months hopefully it's this Insight this is the stuff that gets you there.
*   Let's say that you saw this happen after the fact you were working you were sleeping you have a business you're running just couldn't be in front of the charts and you saw afterwards the day closes like this the very next day folks the very next day what do you think the bias should be for your analysis bullish.


Here's the provided text, reorganized and formatted for improved readability and clarity, with every detail preserved.

## Targeting Fair Value Gaps and Market Programs

*   The discussion revolves around targeting a **fair value gap** observed between **May 17th** and **May 24th**.
*   The primary objective is the **Weekly order block**.

### Identifying Market Programs

*   From **May 17th** to **May 24th**, the market exhibited specific "programs":
    *   A **sell program** in **Euro**. This means a bias for short positions.
    *   A bias to go **long** in **Pound Dollar**.
    *   A **long** or **buy program** for **Aussie Dollar**.
    *   A **long** position for **New Zealand versus the US Dollar**.
    *   A **short** position in **Euro Dollar**.
    *   A **short** position in **Pound Dollar**.
    *   A **short** position in **Aussie Dollar**.
    *   A **short** position in **New Zealand Dollar**.
    *   A **long** position in **Dollar Yen**.
    *   A **long** position in **Dollar Swiss**.

### Dollar Index Analysis

*   Given that the **Dollar Index** is trending higher:
    *   A range is established, and after the **fair value gap** formation, the draw on liquidity is the **weekly order block**.
    *   For **swing traders**, support needs to be established to set the stage for swing trades.
    *   **Day traders** can enter before the swing traders.

### Establishing Trading Bias

*   Expect higher prices on the **Dollar Index** until the initial objective is met.
*   This sets the tone for a bullish bias, derived from:
    *   Narratives shown on higher time frame **weekly** and **daily charts**.
    *   **Inter-market relationships** (bond market vs. the Dollar Index).
    *   **Market profiling**.

### Market Consolidation and Structure

*   The market is in **consolidation**.
*   Qualification of market structure shift is found in the bonds:
    *   Bonds are in a range; until bonds leave that range, all markets consolidate.
    *   Interest rates drive market dynamics.
*   After the narrative is set, a bias can be established.

### Bullish Dollar Index Scenario

*   The bias is bullish for dollars.
*   Even on days within the consolidation range, the expectation is not to open and immediately buy.
*   The expectation is to consolidate or retrace, with the body supporting the low end of the range.
*   This is considered an algorithmic signature.

### Swing Trading Strategies

*   As a **swing trader**, one could use this day as an entry and pyramid into the run, utilizing the implied dealing range.
*   An **implied dealing range** is different from a real range with a real high and low.
*   It represents an anticipated price run from a low to a target, like the weekly order block.
*   External factors (e.g., geopolitical events, market hacks) can disrupt this.

### Analyzing Implied Dealing Ranges

*   An implied dealing range is where the market is anticipated to go before candlesticks form.
*   Example Scenario:
    *   Analyzing potential breaks in the **Pound**.
    *   If the bond market breaks lower, it could lead to a higher Dollar Index.
    *   The dealing range is from the low to the **weekly fair value gap**.

### Anticipating Market Setups

*   Anticipate where setups will form before they appear on the chart.
*   Focus on where setups form and how to identify **PD arrays** that work.
*   Understand the chart's appearance before the setup materializes and how to trust the anticipation.

### Time Travel Analysis

*   Analyze ranges from low to high to identify **Terminus**, 25%, 50%, and 75% levels.
*   Require bonds to either rise or fall and exit the range.
*   The bond market breaking lower validates the shift in market structure.
*   This sets the mindset for longs and indicates a buy program for the dollar.

### Identifying Accumulation and Breakaway Gaps

*   Anticipate accumulation in specific areas, leading to consolidation before a run.
*   This can result in a **fair value gap**, specifically a breakaway gap.
*   The gap breaks away from consolidation with a shift in market structure.
*   This breakaway gap is used to qualify the trade.
*   The fair value gap needs to be traded, with the expectation of treating it as support, thus becoming an **inversion fair value gap**.

### Understanding Market Readiness

*   New traders preferring simple indicators (e.g., overbought/oversold, moving averages) may not be ready for advanced concepts.
*   Learning to read markets and understand actions requires a different approach.

### Equilibrium and Measuring Gaps

*   A fair value gap forming at equilibrium (50% level) is significant.
*   If the gap doesn't fully close, it becomes a measuring gap.
*   The context implies that the price run can be duplicated to the upside.

### Projecting Price Movements

*   Measure from the low of the root price run to the high of the fair value gap.
*   Duplicate that range to project above the gap.
*   This anticipates the price breaking through and then treating the gap as support.

### Immediate Rebalance and Target Objectives

*   After breaking through the gap, there is an immediate rebalance.
*   A one-day delay is followed by a price run into the weekly order block.
*   The price trades up into the daily order block and the weekly mean threshold order block.
*   Each target is continuously reached.

### Continuous Market Engagement

*   Continuously monitor if the price digs into the next level.
*   Avoid jumping to other markets or setups.
*   The last review indicated the target level of 104.54, which was reached.

### Euro Correlation

*   If the dollar strengthens, the Euro weakens.
*   The Euro falls to a level inside the weekly fair value gap, now an inversion fair value gap.
*   The daily chart shows the treatment of this gap.
*   Shorts in Euro Dollar could be taken based on this.

## Euro Dollar Analysis

*   Analyzing the Euro Dollar daily chart:
    *   Immediate rebalance occurs at one Euro.
    *   The fair value gap is identified, with a draw down into it.
    *   A rally occurs into the up close candle, identified as a bearish order block.

### Hindsight and Market Study

*   Relate market analysis to a surgeon's practice: surgeons dissect cadavers before live patients.
*   Study price action extensively, going back through historical moves to understand market dynamics.
*   **Back-testing**: Analyzing old moves, identifying potential stop-outs, and assessing risk.
*   Using the worst potential entry to ensure profitability.

### Identifying Key Levels and Patterns

*   The fair value gap is identified, and it is expected to gravitate down.
*   An order block is found on the daily chart.

### Minute Chart Analysis

*   Drop to a 60-minute chart to analyze dealing ranges.
*   If the dollar retraces down into the inversion fair value gap on the daily chart:
    *   Inversion fair value gap is based on the weekly chart.
    *   This is a discount for the dollar.
    *   A rally in the dollar is expected, leading to a Euro Dollar sell-off.

### Anticipating Sell-Offs

*   Anticipate Euro Dollar sell-offs by examining the high to low range.
*   Identify equilibrium (50% level) and potential PD arrays.
*   High-probability shorts occur in premium markets above equilibrium.
*   Look for continuation patterns or premiums for selling short in a bear market.

### Premium Identification

*   Identify premium ranges between the low and high to find PD arrays.
*   The first PD array exists at a premium within the range.
*   Retracements higher into the area indicate a sell-side imbalance, buy-side inefficiency.

### Retail Trader Perspectives

*   The market moves lower, trades, and begins to move.
*   Avoid trailing stop losses too tightly out of fear of being stopped out.
*   There's liquidity above.
*   Retail traders may see a bull flag, anticipating a break above a high to duplicate a run.
*   This logic contrasts with a retail mindset, considering liquidity implications.
*   The market is taking liquidity into account.


Here's the organized and formatted text, preserving every detail and nuance while enhancing readability:

## Understanding Market Liquidity and Algorithmic Behavior

### Targeting Liquidity: A Smart Money Perspective

*   **Old highs and lows** are fundamental in understanding where markets will target liquidity.
*   Pairing visible liquidity with retail-minded ideas helps identify opportunities opposed to conventional thinking.
*   Emphasis is placed on understanding how **smart money** perceives and engages with price, and what the **algorithm** does.
*   The algorithm aims to deliver price **above a high** to account for buy stops entering the market.
*   **Market orders** buying at the market prompt smart money to offer shorts at the same time.

### Identifying Opposing Draws on Price

*   After price enters a **fair value gap**, identifying the opposing draw on price becomes crucial.
*   In this scenario, the **buy stop** above a specific high acts as the opposing draw on price.
*   The market trades up to that level, contrasting with the dollar's movement at 2 A.M. on Tuesday, June 6th.
*   The dollar Index was making a low at the time of the fair value gap, indicating a **mirror image**.

### Qualifying Setups with Inter-market Relationships

*   Setups should be qualified not just by their appearance on a chart, but also by **inter-market relationships**.
*   For instance, when shorting the Euro, a corresponding long setup in the Dollar is desirable.
*   If a Dollar setup isn't evident, it opposes a Cable (Pound Dollar) or Fiber (Euro USD) trade.
*   Forex pairs with currencies other than the Dollar as the base currency need setups opposing the Dollar.
*   A potentially long setup for the Dollar involves trading within a fair value gap, anticipating higher prices.
*   Pairs beginning with "USD" (e.g., Dollar Yen, Dollar Swiss) should mirror the Dollar Index's upward movement.
*   The Euro Dollar, inversely related to the Dollar, is expected to move lower as the Dollar rises.

### Algorithmic Referencing of Ranges

*   Price isn't expected to randomly move to a level without reason.
*   The algorithm refers back to specific ranges, needing to only reach equilibrium or slightly higher.
*   Fibonacci is used only to define premium and discount ranges, identifying where setups are likely to form.
*   Within the range, the focus is on locating premium arrays for potential setups.
*   An example of the first premium array is a **fair value gap**.

### Analyzing Price Action and Order Blocks

*   Extensive up and down movement in price indicates balance.
*   An **order block** is identified as the last up-close candle with the highest close.
*   The opening price represents a level that price doesn't necessarily need to reach due to shielded inefficiency.
*   The relevant PD array in this scenario is the fair value gap.
*   The specific market action occurs during the London Kill Zone, at 2 A.M. New York time.

### Anticipating Market Movements

*   The question of where price will go next is addressed by examining liquidity.
*   At equilibrium or higher, the market is considered overbought, without needing indicators.
*   The chart is used to measure ranges with Fibonacci and to identify inefficiencies or liquidity.
*   Visual aids highlight specific areas, focusing attention and facilitating understanding of their use.
*   If the market goes higher to take buy stops, it trades into a short-term premium relative to the range.

### Identifying Significant Price Swings

*   The focus is on intermediate-term price runs, disregarding micro price swings.
*   Ranges are analyzed on weekends or mornings before kill zones/sessions.
*   Potential dealing ranges are examined across daily, four-hour, hourly, and 15-minute charts.
*   The number of PD arrays within a specific price run (high to low) is evaluated.
*   The only PD array to consider in a specific price run is the fair value gap itself.
*   The market only needs to reach a certain level, such as a fair value gap.
*   At that moment, the dollar goes down to its fair value gap at a discount, while Euro goes up to a premium.

### Time and Market Correlations

*   The specific time of day is 2 A.M. New York time.
*   After reaching the target, price is allowed to run higher.
*   The opposing draw on liquidity is the low where a sharp rally occurred.
*   The market induces traders to go long, forming a pseudo bull flag.
*   The market goes up enough to validate buyers on a breakout but only goes up to a key level recognized by the algorithm.

### Understanding Bull Flags and Smart Money

*   **Fake bull flags** occur in specific situations, as taught in core content.
*   The market takes buy stops into the marketplace, and smart money sells short.
*   Two things are accomplished: a premium fair value gap is created, and buy-side liquidity is taken.
*   Buy stops or buy-side liquidity is purged.
*   Smart money sells to those buyers, aiming to exit at a discount.
*   The focus is on where retail traders would fortify/protect their position, resting below a low for sell stops.

### Analyzing Market Structure and Fair Value Gaps

*   The market drops precipitously, targeting sell-side liquidity.
*   Because of the existence of a previous old gap, the existence of current outside gaps are analyzed.
*   The fair value gap is identified, and a bearish order block forms at consequent encroachment of this gap.
*   If the market wants to take out a low where another level of sell-side liquidity exists, the bearish order block must hold.
*   The market needs to stay below a particular candlestick, more specifically at a certain level.
*   If it trades above that candlestick, it means something different, creating an unfavorable trading environment.
*   It has already fulfilled a role by taking buy stops and then sell stops.

### Breakaway Gaps and PD Arrays

*   The potential for consolidation is recognized.
*   However, the market needs to stay in the lower half of the specific shaded area to potentially go lower.
*   Breakaway gaps, PD arrays, and their importance are addressed.
*   Traders should use the PD array that the market provides.
*   Not all PD arrays exist in every fractal of price action.
*   The market is called before it happens, and students are profiting with real money.
*   The importance of continuous learning and study is emphasized.

### Disclaimers and Teaching Style

*   Information is provided freely; no payments or personal information is required.
*   Discord channels are not run, and crypto is not taught.
*   Any claims about teaching crypto or private mentorships are fraudulent.
*   This free resource requires only attention and dedicated study.

### Analysis of Cable (Pound Dollar) vs. Euro

*   Euro is preferred over Cable because Cable doesn't have a clean run.
*   Cable's price action is "muddy," with smaller, less obvious gaps.
*   Euro's fair value gap stands out more clearly compared to Cable.
*   If trading the London session, Euro would be preferred due to cleaner price action.
*   While Cable ran lower, it only needed to trade into an imbalance.
*   Euro Dollar was a better trading opportunity.

### E-mini S&P Weekly Chart Analysis

*   The analysis shifts to the weekly chart of the E-mini S&P.
*   This caters to forex traders who may not be familiar with indices.


Here's the reorganized and formatted text, designed for enhanced readability and AI analysis, retaining all original details and nuances:

## Understanding Forex Concepts and Market Dynamics

### Trading Forex Concepts in ES (E-mini S&P)

*   The Forex concepts taught are not limited to Forex trading. Unless explicitly stated, the teachings are about **price delivery**.
*   **Smart Money Concepts (SMC)** are presented as the author's original work and creations.
*   These concepts have no barriers by asset and are not limited, meaning they can be applied to various markets.
*   The primary focus has been on **index futures**. All teachings are demonstrated within this medium or asset.
*   The teachings are applicable to Forex, even if the focus is on index futures.

### The Bond Market's Influence

*   The bond market signals potential market movements. If the **bond market signals a move lower** out of a range, it sets the tone for market movement.
*   **Movement in Bonds allows all other asset classes are free to move.**
*   The market leaves consolidation, enabling **price swings to evolve**.
*   **Daily charts can start booking sustained runs**, not just intraday volatility.
*   When bond markets are trending, expect more sustained price runs.
*   **Consolidation in the bond market suggests consolidation** in specific markets like bonds, index futures, or Forex.
*   The bond market is a **precursor to understanding the macro environment**.

### Market Profiling: Beyond Traditional Indicators

*   The author uses a form of **market profiling** that differs from volume profiling.
*   **Volume profile (horizontal volume communicators), VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price), and Level 2 data are unnecessary.**
*   **Price action "junkies" using ladders on the right side of the chart are distracted.** All necessary information is within the chart.
*   A **time-based chart provides everything needed** to forecast market movements.
*   Traditional traders often wait for specific levels, but these levels don't always work.
*   The teachings focus on **anticipating where and when formations will occur**, reducing uncertainty.
*   **Trading with real money in the first year of learning is discouraged.**
*   Growth should occur at the student's own pace.
*   The author is not grading the student, and neither should they grade themselves, on the speed at which they find continuity and consistency.

### Weekly Chart Analysis: E-mini S&P

*   Analysis begins with the **weekly chart of the E-mini S&P (ES)**, catering to Forex traders unfamiliar with indices.
*   When the price was down in a specific gap, the author indicated it would trade up into a **volume imbalance** (shaded area in white).
*   The volume imbalance is defined by the **opening and closing prices of specific candles**.
*   This volume imbalance acted as a **draw on liquidity**.
*   The "real sweet spot" was identified as a **liquidity void** (separation with blue lines), representing an absence of trading activity.
*   The eye also jumps to a similar potential area if the market continues on the upside.

### Anticipating Market Movements and Fair Value Gaps

*   Earlier, the author highlighted a **fair value gap and order block**, predicting price would extend down.
*   This prediction proved accurate, and price did in fact draw higher.
*   **Bonds moving lower out of consolidation** allows the market to behave in a trending manner.
*   A **rising dollar** typically indicates risk-off sentiment, meaning foreign currencies go lower.
*   Rallies in equities may still occur, but they will be **limited and not explosive**.
*   **Market profiling** involves understanding how price will deliver based on these factors.

### Distinguishing Market Scenarios

*   If the market did not need to return to a volume imbalance or gap, the E-mini S&P, NASDAQ, and Dow could **accelerate lower in shorts**.
*   The stock market is believed to be heavily manipulated and potentially overvalued.
*   Analysis follows the **"breadcrumbs" laid out by the algorithm**.
*   Smart money entities are actively trading against large funds, serving as their counterparty.
*   Smart money provides liquidity and engages in a constant "dance" with large funds.
*   The author teaches how to place stop losses using the same logic as smart money.

### Understanding Smart Money Tactics and Liquidity

*   Smart money isn't concerned with small retail trades (e.g., micro lots in Forex, mini contracts in S&P).
*   They target **large pools of liquidity** brought to the market by large funds.
*   Retail traders are often caught in the "net" of these large-scale operations, even if their stop losses are strategically placed.
*   Retail traders become casualties of events targeting larger players.
*   It's crucial to **understand how smart money targets large liquidity** and learn to navigate the market accordingly.
*   Some markets exhibit explosive behavior, while others require a more cautious approach.

### Market Strength and Trading Strategies

*   The author has been consistently calling for the E-mini S&P to move higher, with specific levels being accurately reached.
*   **NASDAQ (NQ) was identified as the stronger market to the upside.**
*   Traders were encouraged to focus their trading in NASDAQ due to its strength.
*   **Using a stronger market (NASDAQ) to trade a slower market (E-mini S&P) in sympathy** can be effective.
*   NASDAQ was clearly more explosive on the weekly chart, and it reached its imbalance strongly and quickly, whereas the E-mini S&P has not made it up to its respective imbalance.
*   The E-mini S&P is still moving higher, but performing lethargically as predicted.

### Visibility and Outperformance

*   The author teaches about market visibility and how to identify when one market will outperform another.
*   Even if only following the E-mini S&P, traders can use insights from NASDAQ to inform their trades.
*   NASDAQ is thinner and moves faster, running for liquidity more quickly due to fewer contracts near the market price.
*   NASDAQ can move 100 handles faster than the E-mini S&P, requiring caution when trading with larger contracts.
*   The author can teach how to identify when NASDAQ will be an outperformer.
*   Sometimes the reverse occurs, with the E-mini S&P outperforming NASDAQ.
*   New traders may find this counterintuitive, but experience and visibility allow for predicting these shifts.

### Learning and Responsibility

*   The author emphasizes that the tools, concepts, and logic provided can be transferred to students to improve their understanding.
*   New traders shouldn't be discouraged if they primarily followed the E-mini S&P, even if NASDAQ offered more profitable opportunities.
*   Students must be **responsible for their own actions** and not blame external factors for their success or failure.
*   Nothing the author says should be a sole reason to enter a trade with real money.
*   The author reminds students of the inherent risks and emphasizes that the goal isn't to get rich quickly.
*   The promise is that students will learn to **read price action more effectively** than through traditional books, courses, or educators.

### Precision and Market Understanding

*   The teaching approach offers a deep understanding of the markets, leading to increased precision.
*   Traders will **respect the risks** involved but will not be paralyzed by uncertainty.
*   They will know what to look for, wait for the right formations, and execute trades with confidence.
*   They will understand where to place stops, take partial profits, and set targets.
*   This level of understanding requires **dedicated study and not just casual viewing of videos**.

### Practical Examples and Fibonacci Settings

*   The E-mini S&P had a real gap, which was highlighted as a specific area of focus.
*   The market rallied into this gap, confirming its significance.
*   Students are encouraged to conduct their own homework on lower time frames.
*   **Fibonacci settings are provided:** (Specific levels to be inserted here from original text).
*   These levels provide gradient levels for grading a price swing.
*   On lower timeframes, like 1 and 5 minute charts, the gradient levels around 75, 50, and 25 respectively, manifest into PD Arrays.
*   Students should study the PD arrays and setups that form at these levels to better understand algorithmic price delivery.

### Anticipating Market Movements vs. Reacting

*   The author contrasts his approach with those who rely on market profile and VWAP.
*   While others are waiting for something to react to, the author can tell you where price is going to be with elements of time.
*   Traditional indicators, such as overbought/oversold signals or MACD slopes, are not needed.
*   The author asserts that his teaching is **"light years ahead"** of conventional methods.
*   Results may appear "cherry-picked" due to the consistent accuracy, but successful outcomes are also achievable with weekly and daily charts.


Here's the reorganized and formatted text, designed for enhanced readability and AI analysis, retaining all original details and nuances:

## Forex Concepts and Market Dynamics: A Deep Dive

### Addressing Critics and Sharing Knowledge

*   The author addresses those "goobers" who criticize his free teachings.
*   He believes they are trying to distract people because they dislike that he's providing quality education for free.
*   The author expresses respect for these critics, even though he feels he could "smash all of them."
*   His goal is to **leave in November on a positive note**, without animosity.
*   He wants even those who dislike him and sell courses to secretly incorporate his teachings if it improves their products and benefits their students.
*   The author doesn't want to harm anyone's business and is doing this to **help others**.
*   He loves, enjoys, and is passionate about teaching.
*   This passion is not limited, as demonstrated by the many long-term followers and former "haters" he has.

### E-mini S&P (ES) Analysis: Lower Time Frame

*   Transitioning to a lower time frame discussion on the E-mini S&P (ES).
*   Dropping down to a four-hour chart.
*   Referring to a **daily discount fair value gap**.
    *   The market rallied, consolidated, and worked inside this imbalance and into a breaker.
    *   The breaker is defined as a "low, high, lower low, less up close candle."
    *   Extending this breaker into the future shows it's hit multiple times.
    *   The author checks visually to confirm the hits.
*   This breaker is explicitly **not a supply and demand zone**.
    *   Contrasting with Sam Seiden's followers who might consider it a demand zone.
    *   The author states that it’s no longer fresh; it's "stale bread" or even a "crouton."
    *   They (Sam Seiden's followers) would never use this logic.
*   **PD arrays can be reused** as long as the narrative of looking for higher prices stays intact.
    *   Their "sponsorship" doesn't expire just because they've been traded to before.
*   Large consolidation is present.
*   The market rallies up, creating another area of equal highs, and then drops back down.
    *   It drops down into inefficiencies.
    *   Close examination reveals a specific detail.
*   The author reiterates his prediction that **ES will go higher**, up into the gap defined by two blue lines.
*   This gap represents the "real liquidity void," which is the highest portion of the volume imbalance on the weekly chart.
*   Because the market is expected to gravitate upwards, the author is not looking for shorts.
    *   He wouldn't consider a rally to this point as an opportunity to go short.
    *   If the market goes above the gap and closes above it, this confirms the bullish bias.
        *   This is initially observed on a four-hour chart, implying confirmation on hourly or 15-minute charts.
*   This fair value gap would be treated the same way he advises against with the dollar index fair value gap being an inversion failure fair value gap.
    *   Meaning we don't want to see it go above and treat it as support.

### Reading Price Action: Bodies vs. Wicks

*   Emphasizes the importance of **candle bodies** over wicks.
    *   "The narrative, the real story, is in the bodies."
    *   "The wicks do the damage," but the bodies tell the story.
    *   Even if the price wicks through a level, observe where it closes.
*   Considers the body's closure as "consequent encroachment," the midpoint of the gap.
*   Specifically, the level of 4182.25 is highlighted, matching both the close and the open.
*   The author sarcastically challenges anyone who argues against this logic, particularly "dollar menu mentors."
    *   Expresses mock sympathy for those who haven't learned this from books or discovered it independently.
    *   Urges critics to stop arguing against demonstrably effective principles.
*   Introduces a key concept for inversion fair value gaps.

### Inversion Fair Value Gaps: A Trading Signature

*   Provides a **note for traders:**
    *   If you have an inversion fair value gap and a regular fair value gap just below it within your dealing range (low to high), you want to see the price trade *through* the inversion fair value gap because you're bullish (buy-side).
    *   This is said even before knowing that the second fair value gap will form.
*   The author explains that ICT (Inner Circle Trader) teaches you how to know when fair value gaps shouldn't close.
*   An inversion fair value gap is one of those "signatures."
*   All this area should stay open, or at least a portion of it should stay open.
*   Anticipated price action is illustrated.
*   Some students might see an entry in this shaded area as their "multiplier," going long when price drops into it.
*   Other students might wait for proof with the bodies respecting either consequent encroachment or the high of the fair value gap.
*   A body closes at the consequent encroachment on a specific candle.
*   As soon as this happens, you can trust that this area should not be traded down into.
*   Calls this "technical science baby, take notes!"
*   Humorously references "Goldman Sachs" to emphasize the importance of the information.
*   This "run" aims for buy-side liquidity.

### Targeting Liquidity Pools and Institutional Order Flow

*   Explains that traders who simply watch his videos and see relative equal highs shouldn't automatically assume a short opportunity.
*   They should not look at this as a trusted short.
*   The author wants to see something at a later time uses a long to target those individuals
*   This area is described as a **buy-side liquidity pool.**
*   If a student uses this entry on this FVG, they could use this as a institutional order flow entry drill.
    *   Meaning they only need it to go to that level, or just below it, of this fair value Gap.
    *   Trusting because we have an inversion fair value Gap here that's going to support price.
    *   If we get a signature showing either one of these conditions occur, a body closes at the high or closes at the constant encroachment.
    *   As soon as that happens, the algorithm will immediately spool and go the other direction.
    *   Aimed for delivery to the upside, going after buy side or inefficiency above old highs, buy sides here
*   Asks, rhetorically, if the market looked like it wanted to go higher in a hurry.
    *   Asserts that his chart looks like this and asks if the listeners' charts do as well.
    *   It draws to this area.
*   An **"open immediate rebalance"** occurs, hitting the target.
*   Stresses that he predicted this weeks ago and it's documented on YouTube and Twitter.
*   They were focusing on longs, bullish buying long where to right here right up here, immediate rebalance.
*   Even though by side was taken.
*   Criticizes those teaching "FU Candles."
    *   States, "There are no FU candles."
    *   "That's not my stuff."
    *   Says they can pretend a mythological creature called a FU candle exists if they wish.
    *   They claim that, after running up and taking the stops, it's going to sell off
*   Explains that a higher time frame PD array that has yet to be traded to determines whether it will continue higher.
*   He doesn't see the equal highs being traded to as a reason to reject and go lower. That's just a partial to him, and he's holding, looking for even higher prices
*   If it's trading like this going into a Friday or Thursday and getting into this area but not quite to the high, it could wait until the next week's Monday, or if it's a holiday, into Tuesday.
*   Explains that **all these things have to be weighed out when you're reading and are trading.**
    *   It's not to simply get in there and just hold it over the weekend.
*   Over the weekend, there is enormous Gap risk.

### Gap Risk and Market Openings

*   **Gap risk** is defined as the likelihood of an opening that is unfavorable to your position.
*   For example, if you're long and up 80 handles on ES, it could open up where you're only up 40 handles.
*   In better scenarios, it could open up and you're up 120 handles.
*   If that happens, take your profits because it's likely to come in and close the gap.
*   You don't know if it will fill the gap and continue higher or close the gap, sputter higher a little, and then careen lower.
*   "There's lots of things you have to know."
*   He giving us all that experience in my dialogue that we haven't encountered
*   That's why watching multiple times is required
*   The reason for requiring that or leaning on the necessity of having that information in the beginning most of you have no idea.
*   That's why, if you watch my videos multiple times, it feels like you're watching a brand new video when you're paying attention.
*   It sounds like, I didn't hear him say that the first time, when the video is the same one, but now it's more meaningful to you because you're not trading or you're doing back testing, you have more experience and you're like, oh, that's why he said that.
*   You can't just watch my videos one time.
*   He doesn't care if you watch his videos, but that's not a reason to run his ad revenue up.
*   He is putting them up there, and not taking them down when he stop in November.
*   They're there to keep people from wanting to buy from Jokers out there trying to sell it.
*   They're still trying to, they're on my YouTube channel, stop trying to fish around for the videos, the videos that you need are those.
*   He is teaching even more my charter members, the people that pay him, they're in the audience right now learning just like you are.
*   The things he talking about right here, they've never learned that.
*   They've never learned this, this is all fresh right from the oven to by ICT and it's not in your books.

### 15-Minute Time Frame Analysis

*   Moving to a 15-minute time frame on ES.

### Weekly Chart Analysis

*   Looking at the weekly chart, Monday was the day we traded up into the high end of that gap.
*   The gap is defined by this level as the high, and this level as the low.
*   This is all non-farm payroll garbage; this is trashy delivery.
*   See how we fell short of that gap on the weekly chart, it didn't get to the low of it here, and then careened all the way back down into this down closed candle, and then back and forth.
*   This low right there is constical encroachment or just below it of this Wick, then it rally strongly up into the low that Weekly got and trades up to consequent encroachment or midpoint of that range high and low of the weekly Gap.

### The Horseshoes Analogy

*   The author uses a horseshoes analogy.
*   You take two steel posts, little metal poles, and you beat them down under the ground.
*   We have real horseshoes, and you stand over there, and you got typically two horseshoes a player, and you try to toss the Horseshoe and try to get it to ring around that that little metal post.
*   Think about your trades and where you're trying to see price go to.
*   Whether or not you get that horseshoe on that post or not is irrelevant; you're aiming for it to go to that post, so you're tossing horseshoes in that vicinity with the expectation that it's going to get a ringer.
*   A ringer in this case on that Gap would be getting to the high, which is what we see it trade to on Friday.
*   Is it a losing trade if you got long and you got out in here and left it thinking that, okay, it might not trade, you know, Friday's afternoon session into that high, it might leave it till the next week.
*   The author doesn't think it would be a losing trade at all, if you stick with that narrative that as long as you're tossing trades in with the expectation that the the direction you're aiming your horseshoes or your trades or you're trying to take partials you're trying to reach for these levels to get paid at, you don't need a ringer to be profitable.
*   The right expression in your equation for success is failure.
*   You think success is only if it goes to the Target you called for, that's not true.
*   Success is making money.
*   Success is being profitable.
*   If you got more money in your pocket than you had last week you got more money in your account than you had yesterday that's success.
*   It's modular long-term consistency, or longevity in trading, is long-term profitability that will absolutely have periods of drawdown where you're losing trades, and that's okay.
*   Limit your risk, cut your business size in half each time you take a loss, and you try to get 50% of the previous loss you got.
*   Once you get that, they can go back to a little bit higher risk, a little bit higher risk.
*   Going slow in the beginning is important, but keep in the proper perspective and what you're looking for in price action, where is it going, how should you expect price to deliver
*   He's covered all that today
*   He's covered how how a price should deliver
*   He showed us where it was going to go
*   He told us specifically where it was going to go weeks ago
*   And we got it here Friday

### Current Week and Closing Thoughts

*   Looking at Thursday and Friday
*   There's a current new week opening Gap, very, very small, little tiny little opening Gap.
*   Did it gravitate back to it? Yes.
*   New week opening gaps are like that little post in the game of horseshoes.
*   You don't need it to be a ringer, but it's your; everybody in smart money is aiming for that.
*   We're consolidating, consolidating, consolidating, and then we broke lower, trapping Traders going short.
*   Why? Because they think it's gone up too long; it has to be going lower, so sell side has been taken.
*   The Trap Traders' short rallies, small little Gap trades down into it here, but we gravitate back to that new week opening Gap.
*   You see this little section of price action here?
*   If this stays open and we take out that low, then we're going lower until that point.
*   He's staying bullish on ES, as simple as that.
*   It's not complicated.
*   It's not, you know, making something bloated with assuming moving parts, and we don't need this level.
*   If asked what that level is, he don't remember off the top and hit what it is.
*   He don't have his notes next to him
*   He's below the Gap, and the...

## Market Analysis and Trading Psychology: A Deep Dive

### Analyzing Current Market Conditions: E-mini S&P (ES)

*   The author discusses **premium fair value gaps** and whether to sell short from them when the market is bullish.
    *   He advises against it, emphasizing the importance of narrative.
*   **Key Question:** Has the market traded to your higher time frame draw on liquidity? (Referring to the weekly chart gap).
*   The author analyzes a specific gap scenario:
    *   Most traders would see a return to the gap as a short opportunity.
    *   However, the author points out that the preceding drop took out sell stops, potentially trapping short traders or stopping out longs.
    *   This is followed by a market structure shift and a gap.
*   The author describes a specific gap as "sponky" (color-coded for emphasis).
    *   He cautions that casual viewers (Netflix and chill type of ICT students) may get tripped up and become like the "Joker" he blocked on YouTube, who claimed the strategy only works sometimes.
    *   The author insists that the strategy always works when properly understood and applied.
*   He reiterates that the **Silver Bullet** (his core strategy) is always present and involves:
    *   Market structure shifts.
    *   Draws on liquidity (the most paramount lesson).
*   He highlights the importance of the **midpoint (consequent encroachment)** between the high and low of the weekly gap as a target.
    *   Using the horseshoes analogy, the midpoint is a "real good Target."
    *   A "perfect ringer" would be the high end of the gap.
*   Currently, the market is consolidating around 4430 on a Friday.
    *   The author believes the likelihood of closing the gap that day is low due to the impending close.
    *   He anticipates the remaining portion will be targeted on Monday or Tuesday.
    *   **Recommendation:** Remain bullish until the level is hit, then shift to neutral.

### The Power of Neutrality: A Trading Position

*   The author emphasizes that being on the **sidelines (neutral)** is a valid and profitable position.
    *   It incurs no risk and ensures the account balance remains unchanged.
    *   He questions why people struggle to remain neutral, viewing day trading as an everyday activity, which is not the case for professionals.
*   **Inversion Fair Value Gaps:**
    *   The author wants to see price trade above, come back down, and then rally.
    *   Absence of that calls for doing nothing.
    *   The bullish narrative holds because price fell short of the weekly gap's low.
*   He anticipates price will gravitate towards the gap's low.
*   **Algorithm Logic:** Every retracement/discount is an opportunity for high-frequency trading algorithms to go long.
    *   These algorithms target the inefficiency in the volume imbalance, which average traders overlook.
*   The author criticizes those who argue against his approach, particularly those questioning the relevance of gaps in specific contract months.
    *   He urges listeners to focus on what works instead of arguing.
*   He reiterates his plan to "get out of Dodge in November" and return to enjoying his life.
*   He stresses that learning the strategies requires effort and dedication, despite some individuals achieving significant financial success using them.
*   He acknowledges the doubts and fears that new learners may face ("What if I can't do it?"), but encourages persistence.
*   He emphasizes the importance of discipline and avoiding distractions.

### Trading Psychology and Mindset: A Crucial Foundation

*   Addressing the "rage" around funded accounts (e.g., $150,000 accounts):
*   Using a devil's advocate approach, he proposes a scenario where someone dedicates a full year to his teachings.
*   He draws an analogy to college, where much of the learned material is never used professionally.
*   **Key Question:** Are you 100% convinced that trading is for you?
    *   If not, he advises against pursuing it to avoid pain, misery, and financial loss.
    *   He warns against dabbling or relying on "easy Black Box" solutions.
*   He emphasizes that lukewarm or half-hearted attempts will lead to failure.
*   Profitability, not perfection, is the goal.
*   He champions the use of demo accounts to desensitize traders to being right or wrong.
*   He believes his students are successful because they are making money from what he teaches.
*   He poses a rhetorical question: If you were making $300,000 in three months, would you care about dissenting opinions?
*   He emphasizes that the acquired skill set is permanent and cannot be taken away.
*   He rebukes those who dismiss his teachings as a scam, pointing to the success stories of his students in funded companies.
*   He emphasizes that these funded companies are independent and have no affiliation with him.
*   **Key Question:** How do I know when I can go for a funded account challenge?
    *   **Minimum Requirement:** Complete lack of emotional attachment to the outcome.
    *   Trading should feel routine and unemotional.
    *   Avoid feeling a rush to trade every day.
    *   Consistent profitability in a demo account for a minimum of six months is mandatory for beginners.
    *   Experienced, already profitable traders might shorten that time to 3 months as a "supercharge."
*   **Warning Signs:** Eagerness, salivation for monday's trade, any emotion towards the market
    *   It indicates a gambling mindset, not a trading mindset.
    *   Avoid funded accounts if emotionally charged, as failure is likely and will create mental scar tissue.
*   He expresses confidence that everyone listening can succeed if they are passionate and dedicated.
*   He clarifies that he's not selling a "timeshare" with upsells; his teachings are freely available.
*   He has more faith in his listeners' potential success than they might have in themselves.

### Practical Application: Trading Scenarios and Strategies

*   Assuming a six-month commitment and a funded account ($150,000):
*   Emphasizes the importance of knowing your model and only taking trades when the conditions align.
*   Using Friday's scenario (inversion fair value gap) as an example:
    *   Focus on "tossing the orders" into the weekly gap.
    *   Utilize gradient levels (25%, 75%) within the gap range.
    *   Observe the reaction at equilibrium (50%).
*   Illustrates scaling into long positions, taking partials, and managing stops.
*   The desire to make a lot of money quickly should be eliminated.
*   Focus should be on following the logic and sticking within the narrative he shares.
*   **Current Stance:** Neutral, as targets have been met.
    *   He is waiting for the market to dictate the next move.
    *   He acknowledges the possibility of continued upward movement or a reversal.
*   He advises growing comfortable in these neutral periods.
    *   These are the periods where most traders blow their accounts by forcing trades.
    *   Those who are constantly searching for "what's next" are likely to fail.
    *   They are blowing their demo accounts and will never pass a funded account challenge.


Here's the reorganized and formatted text, designed for enhanced readability and AI analysis, retaining all original details and nuances:

## Advanced Trading Concepts and Mindset

### The Pitfalls of Impatience and the Value of Neutrality

*   Traders who can't remain neutral and are "constantly trying to do something else" are unlikely to succeed in a **funded account challenge.**
    *   If they reach the point of profit split, they will likely "blow it."
*   The key is to be "comfortable in between trades."
*   The speaker emphasizes his contentment with having "murdered it" on higher time frame (weekly and daily) charts, providing swing trade ideas.
    *   He refers to "over a thousand handles in NASDAQ" and "however many Hunter handles or so and uh e-mini s p."
*   He challenges the listener to consider:
    *   "What did you do with the information? How did you use it? What are you going to do with it now?"
*   He cautions against the mindset of thinking his livestreams are a waste of time if he doesn't provide actionable insights in five minutes.
    *   He asserts that this mentality will prevent a trader from becoming profitable.
*   He states he "would have paid money to sit in something like this today when I first started" because the information was absent from books and courses.
*   He claims these are "Concepts that were never meant to be in your hands. They were never meant to be understood by the public."
    *   This exclusivity is "why they work so good because it's the market, it's the market."

### Trading with Discipline and Understanding Market Dynamics

*   Regarding trading with a $100,000 or $150,000 account:
    *   He stresses the importance of "following the logic," doing what is necessary, and trading only when setups are present (i.e., avoiding non-farm payroll).
*   He addresses the common argument of traders who claim to profit trading Non-Farm Payroll, saying "ICT says don't trade on non-farm payroll Fridays and I made this much money and I made that much money and blah blah."
    *   He clarifies that his advice against trading non-farm payroll is specifically for "new students, new Traders, new developing Minds in these markets."
    *   He states, "nobody should be trading during the hour of non-farm payroll period."
*   He acknowledges his ability to trade on non-farm payroll, stating he's shown executions and done live sessions.
    *   He states he doesn't need to prove himself to anyone.
    *   He emphasizes that he is providing the insight on *how* to do it, not obligated to *do* it for them.
*   **Guidance for trading Non-Farm Payroll Fridays:**
    *   Wait for the initial volatility to subside.
    *   Ensure that the objective aligns with a higher time frame chart (daily).
        *   The objectives include buyside liquidity, sell-side liquidity, premium fair value, or discount fair value.
*   He criticizes those who find these outcomes "a complication."
    *   He questions the efficacy of their current trading strategies that consistently lead to losses.
*   He relates to experiences of struggling traders, stating, "I did all that stuff when I was younger. I did all that same stuff folks and I learned by losing lots of money losing lots of accounts. I've blown dozens of accounts I've done that."
*   He realized that "being tenacious" would not lead to success, and he needed to abandon retail strategies.
*   He asked himself, "somebody's winning every time I'm losing somebody is winning what would they be seeing in price."
    *   This marked the beginning of his journey towards becoming a successful trader.

### High Probability Trading and Smart Money Concepts

*   The "average Trader" is likely "ill-informed" and "has no idea what they're doing."
*   He shares an anecdote about his dogs reacting to toads in their pool.

    *   Smart money concepts (which are not found in books).
*   He clarifies that "Goldman Sachs doesn't know this."

    *   Implement these concepts, buying or selling based on specific criteria.
    *   The triggers are not based on patterns, harmonics, or supply and demand.
    *   There is a "draw" that price will stay within, for example, a "buy program."
    *   There are also "sell models" that only shorten when specific conditions are met.

*   He believes that, of the concepts taught, **PD arrays** can be combined with higher time frame analysis and specific trading times to achieve profitability.
*   He reiterates the effectiveness of the **Silver Bullet** strategy, applicable in every kill zone (London, New York AM, New York PM).
    *   He also mentions trading the lunch hour.

*   He stresses that beginners should be happy even with a small proportion of the profits.
*   He discourages comparing oneself to others.
    *   He acknowledges that he could "roll these accounts up hundreds of thousands of dollars in days," but this doesn't represent a realistic objective for students.
*   He warns against high reward trading driven by the desire to quickly make a lot of money.
*   "Hi reward trading or really big results that's for people that are trading with the expectation of trying to fleece you to sell you something."

*   He responds to criticism about profiting from book sales, stating that the YouTube channel is designed to be comprehensive.
*   He states, "I only want it in print because everybody out there that has pretended they found this stuff on their own there's no way none of you Jokers would have ever learned this stuff by looking at charts or studying it."
*   He credits influences that people will never meet.

    *   Despite providing all the information in the same order, no one emerged with the same level of understanding.
*   The reason he began helping more people was not from initial altruism, rather his "obsessive compulsive kicked in" when he couldn't create another ICT from his laboratory conditions.
*   His obsession to create one became like a "rocket fuel" when he received feedback from others stating they were benefiting.
*   He states that he would never have shared this information online earlier in his career, in the 90's, because he was too selfish and didn't want people knowing it.

## Market Analysis and Institutional Overflow Advanced ICT Gap Theory Review

### Introduction

**Video URL:** <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfRO5LrTgTA>

"Good evening, folks, welcome back. I was supposed to be doing a live stream today, but the powers that be weren't with me. OBS wouldn't connect to my YouTube channel, and I had all kinds of issues with it. So, I elected to sit down and wait for the close of the day and then come back in here and do somewhat a little bit of a review, but also I want to teach a little bit more about **institutional overflow Advanced ICT Gap Theory.**"

### Dollar Index (DXY) Analysis

#### Weekly Chart Overview

*   Currently examining the **dollar Index** on a **weekly chart**.
*   Price reached up into the **weekly bearish order block**, specifically the midpoint of the candle.
*   That was pierced last week
*   This week, price is "meandering around" inside the range of the weekly order block's opening price.

#### Daily Chart Breakdown

*   **Fair Value Gap** is visible.
*   The level has been worked multiple times over the past few days.
*   Small **Fair Value Gap** exists.
*   Price traded back down into the old **weekly inversion fair value Gap**.
*   The current narrative assumes a move higher unless the low is broken.
    *   If the low is broken, the focus will shift to buy-side opportunities.
*   **Volume Imbalance** is present.
*   **Wick** exists, implying a **consequent encouragement**.
    *   Levels to watch if price goes above high are the midpoint of the Wick and the volume Imbalance.
    *   This is also the premium Wick consequent encouragement on the weekly chart.

#### Hourly Chart Detail

*   Analyzing price action within a swing low on a larger daily chart through the lens of an hourly chart.
*   **Gap** identified with an absence of a corresponding gap on the opposite side.
*   Only **sell-side liquidity** offered.
    *   The candle delivered on the downside between the low of one candle and the high of another.
    *   It's sell-side delivery inefficient in the form of buy-side delivery.
    *   Price opened, traded down, rallied back up, and closed.
    *   Next candle opened, traded down, stopped inside the Gap low, and then moved higher.

    *"This is a balanced price range. Balanced price ranges tend to either stop at their high or low or midpoint or well she'll be consequent encouragement midpoint of the gap we can see that happening essentially here."*

*   This confirms it isn't simple supply and demand; the algorithm targets inefficiencies.
*   The price traded back and forth.
*   By side and sell side has been offered.
*   If the price returns to that range, it is unlikely to trade to the low of the Gap again.
*   **ICT Balance Price Range:** A range where price has offered both buy-side and sell-side liquidity and then left the range, making a return to the low of the Gap unlikely.
*   **Imbalance** also noted.
    *   Buy-side imbalance with sell-side inefficiency
    *   The candle's low and high constitute the Shaded area.
    *   Only buy-side offered initially, then sell-side offered.
*   The price erupted to the upside after hitting the balanced price range's consequent encroachment.
*   The price worked up into a "very magnet" in the form of a **sell-side imbalanced buy-side inefficiency**.
*   The daily bearish order block was hit multiple times (here, here, and here).
*   The mean threshold weekly bear shorter block stands at 104.54.
*   Small inefficiency still remains.
    *   Between the high of one candle and the low of another, a small gap exists.
*   **ICT Bearish Breaker** Identified
    *   Respect shown multiple times.
    *   Breaking the low would be more meaningful.
*   The overall sentiment is neutral; either consolidation or a move higher is anticipated.

### Euro/Dollar (EUR/USD) Analysis

#### Weekly Chart Perspective

*   All the price action here even at their sell side liquidity resting below this it's being met with high resistance.
*   Price met with high resistance, despite sell-side liquidity resting below.
*   **High Resistance Liquidity Runs**:
    *   Liquidity runs can still deliver and go below here but High Resistance recording runs are very frustrating sometimes.
    *   Explained in Concepts.
    *   "High resistance liquidity runs are very frustrating sometimes for individuals that don't know how to anticipate them or don't know what they are."
    *   Frustrating for traders who don't know how to anticipate them.
*   **High Resistance Liquidity Run vs Low Resistance Liquidity Run**
    *   **Low Resistance Liquidity Run**: High probability and immediate gratification. Almost immediate feedback.
    *   **High Resistance Liquidity Run**: The trade is met with a lot of resistance. Moves in one direction is going to be a lot of consolidation move a little bit come back retrace much more than you're probably comfortable.
        *   It's very hard for it to be one-way delivery.
        *   Can create sporadic emotional responses and agitation.
        *   Traders may move their stop loss too aggressively or open them further due to fear, and it runs for that as well.
        *   Understanding what a high resistance liquidy run is will help you to filter those types of Trades out.
        *   It is Lower probability

#### Daily Chart Examination

*   Bearish order block hit.
*   Consolidating inside of the Gap.
*   Market being met with resistance.
*   The market can still go higher with the dollar going lower.
*   It can work its way through this area here and attack the cell side below it.
*   The current stance is neutral because both sides can be justified, and only high-probability trades with low resistance liquidity run signatures are desired.
*   Belief: Dollar will go higher, and Euro/Dollar will eventually attack the lows.
*   Waiting due to the current market conditions.
*   Commentary/analysis is preferred when the market is one-sided and in low resistance liquidity run signatures.

#### Four Stages of Price Delivery:

1.  **Consolidation**
2.  **Expansion**
3.  **Retracement**
4.  **Reversal**

*   Currently in a consolidation phase, requiring patience.
*   Predicting is easier during one-sided markets with low resistance liquidity runs.
*   One-sided market: either buy or sell with the opposite side being difficult to justify.
*   Waiting for more information due to the current conditions.
*   Trading with low probability is possible but more likely to result in losses.

#### Hourly Chart Deconstruction

*   The last discussion mentioned an area where the market ran up, hit buy-side liquidity, and traded into a short-term premium relative to a high-low range.
*   The buy side was hit then was the premium very bad Gap in the form of a city salsa on a balanced box on an inefficiency it worked lower to attack the sell side here.
*   Market was hanging around that area at the time and on a 15 minute it was examined.
*   The market eventually moved higher to the top end of the daily fair value Gap then went lower failed to make the lower low here and then reversed higher to trade into a deeper premium further up in the upper portion of this 60 Minute fair value Gap in the form of a sell-side imbalanced by certain inefficiency then back into that daily fair value Gap

#### 15-Minute Time Frame Analysis

*   Focused on the hourly fair value Gap.
*   During the live stream, it was stated that if the market were to go lower with high probability, it would need to stay below a certain level.
*   Conversely, if it were to go higher, there was less interest in short positions.
*   The daily fair value Gap's shaded area and consequent encroachment (halfway point of the fair value Gap) were key levels.
*   If consequent encroachment was met and another sell-side fair value Gap was created, it would be considered a premium array, targeting lower lows.
*   Staying around consequent encroachment, rather than going to the high, was preferred if price were to go higher.
*   A failure to take out the sell-side indicates a trap; the lows won't be taken, and a run to the Asia high is likely.
*   **Kill Zones**: Asian Kill Zone and London Kill Zone.
*   Market trades down, fails to go lower, runs a short-term high, indicating a shift in market structure.
*   **Buy-side Imbalance Sell-side Inefficiency** evident.
*   Price trades down to the consequent encroachment and finds some support at the daily fair value gaps
*   The price respects that runs up and consolidates in consequent encroachment which is the midpoint of the Gap High and the low consolidation expansion respects the high of it opens and runs through it takes out age as high swings all the way up into to take by side and trade into a deeper premium on that hourly fair value Gap in the form of a city this area up here that's shaded in pink is this area here on the hourly so this run from here to here is this on the 15 from that low up to that high then we draw right back down into the midpoint of that fair value Gap so again it's reaching for liquidity.
*   Coming up to take out buy stops is good and makes it favors a continued move lower because they left this low and they left the larger pool of liquidity.
*   Sell-side liquidity and a small gap exist.
*   A buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency is present.
*   With sell-side liquidity and relative equal lows, the expectation is for a continued move lower.
*   Target: 1.0660 and potentially lower, particularly for London/New York session.
*   The expectation is based on price action and the assumption of the dollar going higher.

### S\&P June Contract

*   The S\&P June contract will soon roll over into the September contract.
***

## S\&P June Contract Analysis

### June Contract Focus

*   Currently analyzing the **June contract** of the S\&P 500.
*   The identified **Gap** was targeted, and price moved as anticipated.
*   Focus is on the weekly chart, with candlestick representations analyzed.
*   Price hit the **high of the Gap** and is now consolidating within that range, which is typical behavior.

### Consolidation After Objective Achievement

*   When price reaches a higher timeframe target, lower timeframe charts often enter **consolidation**.
*   This occurs after multiple markets hit their objectives, such as the dollar Index reaching premium objectives, the Euro trading down to discount objectives, and the S\&P 500 hitting premium objectives.
*   **Neutral Stance:** Due to this consolidation, a neutral stance is adopted, indicating a wait-and-see approach.

### Market Profile Schematics

*   Emphasis on understanding **market profiles** as schematics or roadmaps for typical price behavior.
*   Specific schematics for **weekly and daily profiles** have been taught to anticipate price performance based on algorithmic tendencies.
*   Since the market has achieved objectives from previous weeks, it's currently pausing and consolidating.
*   **No Implication of Reversal or Continuation**: Consolidation doesn't necessarily indicate a reversal or continuation; it simply means waiting for more information.

### Volume Imbalance Observation

*   A **volume imbalance** is noted between a candle's close and the subsequent candle's opening.
*   This area, around **4240**, could be a potential retracement target without breaking the higher structure.
*   The **buy-side liquidity** above the high would be the next upside target, similar to the NASDAQ pattern.
*   Short-term consolidation or retracement into the volume imbalance area is possible.

### Volume Imbalance Details

*   The volume imbalance is a shaded white area on the chart.
*   If a retracement occurs, price might be drawn into this area.
*   As long as price remains above a specific candle, the bullish structure is maintained.
*   **Rationale for Candle Selection:** The chosen candle is significant because previous down-closed candles (bullish order block) were already tested and propelled price higher.
*   If the price moves outside the volume imbalance, it could retrace to the **consequent encouragement** of the candle's tail, essentially the low of the volume imbalance.
*   A breach below the candle's low would reduce confidence in the anticipation of an upside run.

### Summary of Expectations

*   Expecting consolidation within the white shaded area (volume imbalance).
*   Allowing for a retracement into the defined area, up to half of the candle's tail.
*   **Crucial Condition:** Price must remain above the specified candle's low to maintain the bullish outlook.
*   Anticipating a potential move higher, mirroring NASDAQ's behavior.
*   Acknowledging that market conditions can change rapidly.
*   The analysis is based on the current chart patterns.

### Daily Chart Analysis of S\&P June Contract

*   A **fair value Gap** is present on the daily chart.
*   A **shift in Market structure** occurs before price drops into the fair value Gap.
*   Price rallies up into the Gap, specifically the upper portion of the volume imbalance on the weekly chart (white shaded area).
*   Note: The price is currently hovering within this area, showing indecisiveness.

### Hourly Chart Breakdown

*   **Blue Lines**: Indicate the high and low of the weekly Gap.
*   **White Shaded Area**: Represents the volume imbalance.
*   Attention is drawn to a **Wick** and its **consequent encouragement** (midpoint).
*   The Wick's consequent encouragement is considered a **discount array** because it lies below the current market price.
*   **Devil's Advocate Scenario:** Assuming the market wants to move higher, it could trade down into this discount area and then target buy-side liquidity.
*   Clean highs suggest resistance.
*   Clean (smooth) resistance edges are not preferred; jagged edges are more desirable.
*   There may be a disruption; its timing and manner depend on price action at key Killzones or trading times.

### Further Discount Levels

*   Monitoring price behavior at the **discount consequent encouragement** of the Wick.
*   If the price breaches this level, another Wick with its midpoint should be observed.
*   **Concern:** A return to relative equal highs is undesirable, as it could establish resistance turned potential support.

### Revisit Daily Chart

*   Recalling the earlier mention of **4240**, which resides within the daily chart's volume imbalance.
*   Price might aggressively trade down into this area, potentially moving below recent highs.
*   An extreme scenario could see price reaching the low of the weekly chart's volume imbalance.
*   Level Preference: No particular fondness for the levels mentioned.
*   Viewing these levels as potential support rather than resistance.
*   Believing that a deeper move might be necessary to sell the idea that this is resistance before breaking through it later.

### Four-Hour Chart Reference

*   While a four-hour chart isn't presented, there is a note about a previously shown **inversion fair value Gap** from a live stream on Tuesday, May 23rd, at 10 A.M.
*   The respect for this level is currently being observed, within the daily fair value Gap.

### 5-Minute Time Frame on ES

*   Price tapped right at the high of that volume imbalance, hooking perfectly.
*   Breaks Lower then Trades to the low of the Gap.
*   The Lines represent Gap levels on the weekly chart for ES.
*   **Wick Discount Consequent encouragement** is still considered.
*   Students may find this complicated initially.

### Potential Scenarios and Waiting Approach

*   Thinking it could draw down into that but it depends on how it trades to it and through it.
*   All factors weighed out of the other hourly chart.
*   Waiting to see before making a decision.
*   Levels being watched to see how Market structure forms around them.
*   Sitting neutral, not reacting to price.

### Neutral Stance and Opinions

*   Neutral stance, awaiting further information for prediction.
*   **Personal Opinion**: Expecting a move lower initially, followed by a move higher later.

### 5-Minute Chart Review

*   Buy-side resting above highs.
*   Rallies up to the high of the Weekly Gap.
*   Drops lower.
*   There is now buy-side liquidity below.
*   Drew back into current new week opening Gap.
*   Consolidated around weekly Gap low.
*   Suspect Price trades into 4264 and 4240 area.
*   Anything below 4240 will have to keep mind on daily level.

### Sell-Side Liquidity

*   Sell-side below.
*   Ran for the sell-side, the weekly Gap low.

### AM Session ICT Silver Bullet

*   Trading up into that Gap High.
*   **Key Level**: Higher timeframe weekly objective.
*   Breaks lower, shift in Market structure (bearish).
*   **2022 ICT Mentorship Model**:
    *   Buy-side taken into premium.
    *   Shift in Market structure.
    *   Fair value Gap.
    *   Trades up into it.
    *   Go short.
    *   Aim for relative equal lows and liquidity, or weekly Gap low.

### ICT Silver Bullet Model for 2023

*   Shift in Market structure.
*   Fair value Gap.
*   **CIVI (Sell-side Imbalanced Buy-side Inefficiency):** Price returns back, short position.
*   Breaks one more time below that low, digs into sell-side.
*   Reaching for new week opening Gap.
*   Another fair value Gap, short position.
*   New week opening Gap objective.

### Advanced Gap Theory

*   **Institutional Order Flow Integer Drill**: Partial return into Gap.
*   Consolidates and tears often goes lower.
*   Fibonacci retracement: High to low, 1 standard deviation = 42.78.75
*   Fulcrum point: Range from that low to high subtracted from that low takes us right to 4278.75.

### In-Depth Look at Price Swings

*   Initial runoff, or **Judas Swing**, in the first 30 minutes of trading.
*   Price ran higher, stops dead at the weekly Gap High.
*   Swing low: breaks lower, creates small gap (fair value Gap).
*   **2022 Model**: Buy-side taken, trade up into fair value Gap, go short.

### Breakaway Gaps

*   **Breakaway Gap:** Breaking away from an important higher timeframe High.
*   Higher timeframe weekly Gap High
*   Breakaway gaps must have context as to why price should see.

### Gap Dynamics

*   There is a portion of the Gap unfilled from this candle's low to this candle's high.
*   Two shifts in Market structure.
*   Stop Loss if shorting would be above this candle's High.
*   This area has relative equal lows
*   Breakaway gaps tend to leave a portion of the Gap unfilled.


## Navigating Price Action with Gap Theory and Swing Projections

### Addressing Potential Misinterpretations and Breakaway Gaps

*   **Going Short:** Use taught principles to go short. The following is navigating a position if an initial assumption is incorrect.
*   **Higher Timeframe Target:** If the initial assumption is incorrect and it doesn't evolve into a breakaway gap, wait for the price to move to the higher timeframe objective.
*   **Subsequent Fair Value Gap:** After the price reaches the higher timeframe objective and breaks lower again, creating another fair value gap, treat this new gap as a potential breakaway gap.
*   **Context is Key:** The context for this potential breakaway gap is the price running up, leading traders to believe it will continue higher (bullish sentiment).

### Bull Flag Scenario and Weekly Gap High Importance

*   **Apparent Bull Flag:** Observe a pattern resembling a bull flag from the low to the high.
*   **Retail Trader Sentiment:** Most retail traders would likely perceive this as a bull flag.
*   **Validation and Subsequent Breakdown:** When the price moved above the high, it validated the bull flag perception, leading many to anticipate further upward movement; then, the price broke lower.
*   **Understanding with Weekly Gap High:** Without understanding the Weekly Gap High, the presented analysis would be incomprehensible.
*   **Weeks-Long Awareness:** The Weekly Gap High is a level that has been known for weeks.

### Breakaway Gap Qualification and Confidence

*   **Breakdown and Breakaway Gap:** The price broke down, resulting in a breakaway gap.
*   **Qualification:** It's classified as a breakaway gap because the price moves lower to a new low, leaving a portion of the gap open.
*   **Increased Confidence:** There is increased confidence that the price will not return to the level.
*   **Adjusting Stop Loss:** Drop the stop loss right to that level and allow it to run.

### Fair Value Gaps and ICT Fair Value Gap

*   **Two-Minute Fair Value Gap:** Two one-minute candles create a fair value gap, representing two minutes of price action.
*   **Standard ICT Fair Value Gap:** This is a typical ICT fair value gap, resembling a "civi" formation.
*   **Retrading to Common Gaps:** Common gaps can be retested multiple times, potentially acting as support or resistance.

### CIIVI (Sell-Side Imbalanced Buy-Side Inefficiency) and Consequent Encroachment

*   **Large Gap and Theory:** A large gap is formed by two down-closed candles.
*   **Two-Minute Chart Perspective:** On a two-minute chart, this could be viewed as a CIIVI.
*   **Consequent Encroachment:** The price trades back up into the consequent encroachment of the two-minute range formed by those specific one-minute candles.
*   **Layman's Terms:** The midpoint of the range between the low and high of the candles (on a two-minute chart) is the consequent encroachment.

### Fair Value Gap as a CIIVI and Measuring Gap

*   **CIIVI Identification:** The fair value gap is a CIIVI.
*   **Measuring Gap Function:** This gap is a measuring gap.
*   **Range Projection:** The range of this gap can be used for projecting price movements.
*   **Market Breakdown:** The market breaks lower.

### Another Fair Value Gap and Consequent Encroachment

*   **Another CIIVI:** Another fair value gap forms as a CIIVI (potentially visible as one down-closed candle on a two-minute chart).
*   **Working into Consequent Encroachment:** Price action works into the consequent encroachment, taking buy-side liquidity and then breaking lower to a new low below the Weekly Gap low.

### Standard Fair Value Gaps and Narrative

*   **Common Gap Behavior:** Standard fair value gaps (common gaps) can be reclaimed and act as resistance or support.
*   **Price Trading:** Price trades back up to it.
*   **Body Significance:** The bodies of the candles tell the story.
*   **Wicks vs. Bodies:** The wicks do the damage, while bodies reveal the narrative, and wicks cause confusion.
*   **Naked Price Action:** Analyze price action without relying on candle patterns but focus on time and signatures.
*   **Open and Close:** The open and close of the candles support the idea that the low of the inefficiency is being respected.
*   **Price Action and Target:** Price trades lower, targeting the sell-side liquidity, not some random level.

### Swing Projection Theory and Fibonacci

*   **Fibonacci Application:** Draw a Fibonacci retracement from the high of the price swing down to the high of the gap.
*   **Gap Choice:** Use the gap because it's the measuring gap.
*   **Implied Dealing Range:** This represents approximately half of an implied dealing range (looking for lower prices but haven't seen it yet).
*   **Non-Reactionary:** Remember not reacting to price but predicting price.
*   **Projection:** Draw that down to that candle's high.
*   **Standard Deviation:** This gives a projection to a standard deviation of negative one.
*   **Fibonacci Settings:** The live stream shows where to find the Fibonacci settings.
*   **4269.25 Level:** The negative one standard deviation comes in at 4269.25.
*   **Daily Low:** The daily low to the tick matches the 4269.25 level.
*   **ICT Swing Projection Theory:** This is ICT's swing projection theory.

### Gap Hierarchy and Qualifying Gaps

*   **Gap Hierarchy:** Gaps, like PDRA matrices, have a hierarchy.
*   **Types of Gaps:** Breakaway gaps and common gaps.
*   **Common Gap Behavior:** Common gaps can be reclaimed.
*   **Measuring Gap Characteristics:** Measuring gaps tend to leave a portion open, similar to breakaway gaps.
*   **Bearish Expectation:** Expect price not to trade all the way up.
*   **Confirmation and Qualification:** Not going up confirms it as a measuring gap.
*   **Projection:** Project the high down to the low of the gap to get standard deviations if bearish.
*   **Precision Factors:** The standard deviation negative one must agree with moving below an old area of liquidity.
*   **Gap Understanding:** Understanding that gaps have an hierarchy is key.
*   **Logic Used in Trading:** This logic is used when pyramiding and taking partials off.
*   **Gap Theory Application:** When wanting to leave a portion of the Gap open or unfilled, use this theory.

### Common Gaps and Market Dynamics

*   **Fair Value Gap (Common Gap):** It can be reclaimed and treated as support and resistance.
*   **Price Interaction:** Price comes back up, hits it, and trades lower.
*   **Implied Projection Example:** Using all this mess isn't supply and demand.
*   **Trading Up:** Price trades up into it.
*   **Candle Bodies:** The bodies of the candles respect that candle's high.
*   **Data Observation:** Look at the data.
*   **Low Creation:** Price trades lower and makes the very low of the day.
*   **Theoretical Framework:** This is using ICT's swing projection theory within the context of ICT's advanced gap theory.

### Learning and Application Encouragement

*   **Potential Complexity:** If this is the first time, it may seem complicated.
*   **Positive Confusion:** Feeling confused is a good sign of learning.
*   **Active Learning:** Don't assume understanding from just one viewing.
*   **Backtesting Recommendation:** Go back and look at old price swings, break down the gaps, and use the hierarchy.
*   **Further Gap Concepts:** There are more gap concepts to be taught later on.
*   **Benchmarking:** Use this as a benchmark to go and look at other old price swings and start measuring them out and journal them in the trading journal.
*   **Be Safe:** Until next time, be safe.

Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the text, adhering to all specified requirements:

# Market Analysis and Trading Philosophy

## Introduction

*   Video URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qA9SCu4gGaU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qA9SCu4gGaU)
*   The speaker mentions being "tied up" yesterday, which prevented him from posting.
*   He shared an execution example on Twitter, with the trade link in the video's comment section.
*   The speaker will briefly discuss market analysis, emphasizing time constraints due to travel.

## Dollar Index Analysis (DXY)

### Weekly Chart Overview

*   The speaker references a Wednesday commentary, stating that unless the low is taken out and price trades into an inefficiency, a bullish bias for the dollar and a bearish bias for the Euro would be maintained.
*   He acknowledges the aggressive move toward that low.
*   He explicitly states that he is **not trading Forex** and is **not interested**. However, he will provide his opinion on the market at the time of the analysis.
*   The speaker is trying to demonstrate how to remain neutral and comfortable with not having to be "right" all the time.

### Addressing Skepticism

*   He anticipates skeptics who might criticize if his predictions don't materialize.
*   He emphasizes that his video work and audio clips (on Twitter and YouTube) can easily be taken out of context.
*   He aims to illustrate that **profitability is possible even when being incorrect**.
*   The goal is to teach profitability despite being wrong.

### Wednesday's Commentary Recap

*   The speaker mentioned holding a bullish stance on the dollar unless the low was taken out and price traded into the inefficiency.
*   If price traded below the low and then moved back up, the speaker would expect it to be treated as resistance.
*   This would potentially set the stage for a run into lower levels.

### Current Market Conditions

*   The time of recording is around 11 AM EST on a Friday.
*   The analysis focuses on **Thursday's data**, with a screenshot taken on Thursday.
*   The presentation covers Thursday's action and part of Friday's activity. He will be unable to do a final review.

### Daily Chart Analysis

*   The speaker identifies a **breaker** pattern on the daily chart.
*   The breaker is defined by **high, low, higher high, and down close candles with the lowest close**. He specifically notes that he is not using a different close, he's using the lowest close.
*   He emphasizes the importance of volume and narrative within the bodies of the candles; wicks do the damage.
*   The breaker range, expanded to the right, is highlighted.
*   He calls it a "weekly breaker" but emphasizes that it is found within a range.
*   He is focusing on a specific daily candle to assess activity over more than one week.

### Key Levels and Considerations

*   He highlights the **weekly mean threshold of the bearish order block at 104.54**.
*   The daily order block opening price is also noted.
*   Price did trade down as anticipated.
*   He reiterates that he stated he was going to hold onto a bullish bias for the dollar unless it takes out that low, but he was sitting still and neutral.

### Managing Expectations and Future Outlook

*   He addresses individuals who constantly seek the "next magic trick" after a correct call.
*   The speaker is aiming to teach self-management, essential when he stops providing daily analysis in November.
*   He clarifies his stance: bullish on dollar/bearish on euro dollar as long as the mentioned low holds.
*   Being neutral, he is not looking to take new trades at that time.
*   If the low is breached, he would consider a potential shift in bias, seeing the inefficiency as resistance.
*   A premium array (e.g., fair value gap, breaker) could then facilitate a move into lower areas.
*   He acknowledges that he cannot act on this immediately due to travel and unavailability until the following Tuesday.

## Euro/Dollar (EUR/USD) Analysis

### Weekly Chart

*   EUR/USD worked inside an order block on the weekly chart.
*   There's no inefficiency until higher levels are reached.
*   A further breakdown in the dollar index would make those higher EUR/USD levels points of interest.
*   This remains the outlook unless the EUR/USD low is taken out, which would resume the focus on lower targets.

### Daily Chart

*   The speaker was waiting for more information, remaining neutral.
*   He admits critics may cherry-pick his comments, saying he said something would occur and it didn't.
*   He reiterates he was neutral, not trading Forex, and using the dollar as a risk barometer.
*   While index futures can sometimes contradict the DXY, the correlation in Forex is usually stronger.
*   A declining dollar generally opens doors for rallies in EUR/USD, GBP/USD, AUD/USD, etc.
*   The EUR/USD ran up and took out a high, but remained inside the order block.
*   He reserves his verdict until he returns from travel and observes Monday's trading. He plans to provide commentary on Monday evening via YouTube.

## Trading Philosophy and Mindset

### The Importance of Context

*   He wants to apply context to the mechanics of trading.
*   There's nothing wrong with pre-market analysis and forming expectations.
*   If conditions for a trade are met, then one can consider taking a position.
*   He restates that he was neutral. He had no interest in taking trades.
*   If a market doesn't present conditions for a desired short, there's no reason to be upset if the market doesn't perform the predicted action.

### Defining "Getting it Wrong"

*   **"Getting it wrong" is defined as entering a trade that fails and results in a loss.**
*   No setup presented an expectation with time for a trade.
*   EUR/USD could be traded in the London Open, the New York Open, or the London Close.
*   The speaker was aiming for relative equal lows.

### Price Action and Setup Validation

*   Did the market displace lower after Wednesday's commentary? No.
*   Did it create a fair value gap to trade back into and go short? No.
*   Instead, it rallied, found support in an imbalance, attacked a high, consolidated around a 60-minute fair value gap, and then expanded upward to attack buy-side liquidity.
*   While incorrect in expectation, there was no monetary loss.
*   There was no failed setup.

### Addressing Skeptics (Revisited)

*   Skeptics will point fingers, hoping the audience lacks the understanding to discern the nuance.
*   There was no setup for a displacement trade into a fair value gap, followed by a run on liquidity.
*   While he called an area of interest right below a low, the trade never materialized.

### The Value of a Robust System

*   The absence of a losing trade is positive.
*   Traders should avoid self-blame.
*   His system/method/conceptual ideas prevented a loss, even without presenting a trade opportunity.
*   There was no ego harm because there was no losing trade.

### Flexibility and Avoiding Randomness

*   Flexibility as an analyst is essential; markets can surprise.
*   The beauty is not fearing being wrong.
*   His concepts/setups are actionable when they form, reducing the likelihood of losses.
*   Trading solely on indicators or "black box" systems is considered randomness.
*   He emphasizes reliance on price action.


Okay, here is the meticulously organized and refined version of the provided text, ensuring that all details, contexts, and nuances are retained and presented in a structured and readable format:

# Market Analysis and Trading Philosophy - Continued Discussion

This section continues the discussion from the previous market analysis, focusing on specific trades and trading philosophy.

## Addressing Prior Commentary and Neutrality

*   During Wednesday's analysis, there was no subsequent **displacement lower**, meaning there was no opportunity to engage in a trade.
*   Therefore, no short trade failed because no short trade materialized.
*   This context is presented not to "save face" or appear smart, but to provide proper understanding.
*   The speaker emphasizes that he called for lower prices into certain levels because he was asked to share his opinion at the time.
*   It's simple for someone to be passive, but the presenter is put on the spot to give a prediction.

### Clarifying Expectations

*   While the speaker would have preferred to see the market run the specified lows, there was no actionable setup.
*   Therefore, there's no reason to be upset.
*   There's also no reason to assume that the speaker's concepts don't work or that it's a scam.
*   This is an example of how one navigates price action.

### Comparing with Other Systems

*   Other traders or educators often anticipate specific setups.
*   When those predicted setups do not occur, they must adapt, reverse their position, or remain inactive.
*   The speaker notes that he was asleep during the initial price movement.
*   By the time he awoke on Thursday, the market had already moved significantly.

## Index Futures and Trade Execution

### 15-Minute Timeframe Analysis

*   Focus shifted to index futures, specifically examining a 15-minute timeframe.
*   The speaker points to a gap on the hourly chart, representing a **buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency, or fair value gap**.
*   The market traded back down into this shaded area (the fair value gap).

### London Open Killzone Example

*   On the 15-minute chart, the market traded down into the fair value gap during the London session.
*   This presented a "Judas Swing" opportunity, followed by a rally.
*   Had the speaker seen this prior to the London session, he still wouldn't have traded Forex due to his current focus.
*   He would have anticipated a run into the order block.

### Order Block and Mean Threshold

*   The speaker notes a down-close candle.
*   The market rallied above it and traded into the **mean threshold** of that candle.
*   This was a trade the speaker would have taken if he were actively trading Forex at the time.
*   However, by the time he analyzed the charts, the move had already occurred, and he was not interested in chasing it.

### Signatures of Market Intent

*   The speaker identifies immediate rebalances as "signatures" indicating the market's intention to quickly reach a level of liquidity or inefficiency.
*   The old high on the hourly chart was targeted and reached.

## E-Mini S&P and NASDAQ Analysis

### Weekly Chart Overview

*   The E-mini S&P 500 traded higher into the weekly gap, and buy-side liquidity resides there.
*   There is also a volume imbalance present.
*   NASDAQ had already traded up into its secondary volume imbalance, while the S&P had yet to take out its high.
*   The expectation is for the S&P to trade up into this high unless it completely crashes.

### Daily Chart and Twitter Commentary

*   On the daily chart, there was a buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency.
*   The market traded down into that, leading to relative equal highs.
*   The speaker references a tweet linking to a YouTube commentary from Wednesday at the 24-minute and 5-second mark, where he discusses this hourly chart.
*   He focused on a specific wick and its midpoint (consequent encroachment).

### Playing Devil's Advocate

*   The speaker took the role of devil's advocate, assuming the S&P wanted to go higher.
*   He was neutral on Wednesday, providing an actionable plan of study.
*   This was not just a general statement that the market could go up or down; the speaker provided specifics.
*   To engage with the market's potential upward movement, he pinpointed the wick at the 24-minute and 5-second mark.

### Algorithmic Price Action

*   This concept (the wick midpoint) is not found in textbooks but represents an algorithmic reference point.
*   It's crucial to understand how to identify such wicks.

### Buy-Side Liquidity and Market Dynamics

*   Below the consolidation, there was a weekly gap low and a weekly gap high.
*   Buy-side relative equal highs existed, representing resting buy stops.
*   The speaker dislikes when retail traders perceive such levels as resistance.
*   He uses the expression that "smooth edges like to be made jagged."
*   On Friday, the speaker took a screenshot at 10:25 AM, highlighting this dynamic.

### Institutional Overflow and Market Manipulation

*   Assuming the market wanted to go higher, it could drop into the identified wick.
*   There's no inefficiency, old high, or support/resistance at that point; it's purely algorithmic.
*   The market would return to that price point because it holds significance for the algorithm.
*   The market drops, clearing out relative equal lows before rallying to take out buy-side liquidity.
*   The speaker emphasizes that he specifically mentioned this scenario in Wednesday's analysis at the 24-minute and 5-second mark, offering an opportunity for critics to verify his statements.
*   The drop is just enough for the spread to engage that price before rallying.
*   This illustrates an institutional overflow entry.
*   Any retracement would set up a run to take out buy-side liquidity, exploiting the perception of resistance among retail traders.

## Live Trade Execution Example

### Silver Bullet Trade

*   The speaker mentions a link in the comments section to a live trade execution of the "Silver Bullet" trade for Thursday.
*   He had a level of 4290.50 in mind, targeting an inefficiency rate just below that level.
*   He waited for a short-term high to form.

### Managing Equity and Targets

*   He teaches students to run down equity when approaching targets or reaching three-quarters of the way to a profit objective.
*   Whenever a short-term high is broken, partial profits should be taken.
*   Partial profits always pay, encouraging consistency and further study.
*   The speaker advises against rigid trading plans that rely solely on hitting a specific target.

### Graduated Understanding of Liquidity

*   He advocates a graduated understanding of liquidity and trade management.
*   He executes this strategy consistently in both Forex and index futures trading.
*   The trade execution from Thursday, within this price range, is linked for viewers to observe.

## Two-Minute Chart Analysis and Trade Pyramiding

### Identifying Imbalances

*   The speaker used a two-minute chart to identify an imbalance.
*   He acknowledges that the time frame labels were not visible in a previous video but aims to improve clarity in future content.
*   The inefficiency or gap is identified on the two-minute timeframe.

### Bullish Breaker and Trade Entries

*   As the market dropped, the speaker bought as it slammed into the identified level.
*   He was using a five-contract position, pyramiding on the lows.
*   This setup aligns with his **ICT bullish breaker** concept.
*   If the market traded above a high and retraced into it, he would consider that a reason for the algorithm to reprice higher.

### Profit Taking and Target Precision

*   The market interacted with the breaker multiple times before rallying.
*   Upon breaking a short-term high, he took five contracts off at 4288, which was within the hourly imbalance.
*   He chose that level due to its order flow and proximity to the 4290.50 swing high on the hourly chart, where buy-side liquidity was expected.
*   His stop loss was placed above, and the recording was left running to confirm the market reached his target of 4290.
*   Limit orders were placed slightly below 4290 to account for the spread.

### Trade Outcome and Perspective

*   The trade resulted in over $10,000 in profit, considered a good month for many.
*   The speaker clarifies that profitability, regardless of the amount, is the ultimate goal, discouraging any feeling that trades must meet a certain monetary value to be considered "ICT acceptable".
*   He encourages aspiring traders to gradually build their equity to reach a stage where they can execute such trades.
*   He acknowledges that even smaller trades with fewer contracts can be better than the average daily job.

### Closing Remarks

*   The speaker wishes the audience a pleasant and safe weekend.
*   He will be quiet on Twitter, spending time with his family.
*   He plans to return with more analysis on Monday, Lord willing.

Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining all details and nuances:

# **Pre-CPI Market Analysis and Trading Strategy (Live Commentary)**

**Video URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YTK5uXBe4o

## **Introduction: Navigating CPI Release**

*   Good morning, folks! Retail traders will be facing potential volatility with the upcoming CPI numbers in about 19 minutes.
*   **Important Note:** Avoid getting ahead of the CPI data. Incorrect assumptions can be destructive to your trading.

    *   The speaker adopts a sidelines approach to this report due to past negative experiences.
*   **Today's Agenda:** Quick analysis of:
    *   E-mini S&P 500 (ES)
    *   Euro/Dollar (EUR/USD)
    *   Cable (GBP/USD)
    *   Dollar Index (DXY)
    *   NASDAQ (NQ)
    *   Dow Futures
    *   Gold (XAU/USD)
*   **Focus:** Understanding setup formations and trusting core trading principles.

## **Crucial Disclaimer: Laboratory Experiment Mindset**

*   Treat everything discussed today as a "laboratory experiment."
    *   Do not attempt to trade based on this information, even in a demo account.
    *   The speaker will not be trading live based on this analysis and will be present throughout the CPI release.
*   **Purpose:** Observing the market's reaction *without* personal financial risk.

---

## **Dollar Index (DXY) Analysis**

*   **Weekly Chart:** Currently at the bottom of a gap.
    *   This gap was initially treated as an *inversion gap*, providing support for upward movement into premium arrays.
    *   Price has since moved lower, back inside the gap.
    *   The speaker wants to see if the price will move outside the gap and then treat the shaded area as resistance.
    *   So far, the low of the gap has been respected.
*   **Daily Chart:** A small remaining gap with an order block is noted.
    *   This observation *does not* mean assuming an immediate dollar sell-off.
    *   The CPI number needs to support this idea.
*   **CPI Warning:** Do not get in front of the CPI number; it can be very one-sided.
    *   Stop-loss orders may not provide protection due to potential price gaps and liquidity pulls by brokers and liquidity providers.
*   **Post-CPI Strategy:**
    *   Allow the initial "chaos" to subside.
    *   Identify "easy targets" after the "impact crater" has formed (liquidity runs or runs to inefficiencies).
    *   The CPI surge is likened to a boulder dropped into a smooth pond, creating ripples of opportunity across different time frames.
    *   Identify setups forming on 1-minute, 5-minute, 15-minute charts.
*   **Specific Scenario:** The speaker wants to see if the price will get below the gap and then treat it as resistance, gravitating towards an inefficiency between specific candles (the opening price of a down-close candle on the daily chart). This is *not* a prediction, but a possible scenario.

---

## **Euro/Dollar (EUR/USD) Analysis**

*   Similar to the DXY, there's a very small order block.
*   **Key Level:** Focus on a small gap - The separation is very small.
    *   Observe if CPI lends well to the market getting up to this level.
    *   Anticipate a small pool of liquidity in the form of buy stops resting above this.
    *   Don't need any Market Maps.
*   **Book Map:** Book Map is great in the beginning but if you study Price Action Naked you will see above swing highs and lows there are obvious stops and liquidity.
*   Since the market moved away from the gap and traded above short-term highs, consider the willingness of CPI to expand in this direction.
*   **Bearish Scenario Trigger:** If the price takes out a specific low (the consequent encroachment of a specific wick), it signals bearishness on EUR/USD.
    *   **Reason:** Change in the state of delivery within the gap.
*   **Current Favored Scenario:** Looking for the order block and the Gap area to be reached.
*   **Important:** This isn't a "two-scenario" prediction but an observation of what the speaker is watching for.

---

## **CPI Considerations: Manual Intervention and Risk Management**

*   CPI is like FOMC announcements – a potential "landmine."
*   **Strategy for the Week:** Capitalize on opportunities early in the week (Monday was a good day).
    *   (If this live stream gets enough thumbs up, the speaker will do a video on how they took yesterday's trade)
*   Looking for evidence to support a bias for the rest of the week.
*   Manual intervention ("powers that be," "market makers") determines market direction and price levels, overriding typical trading indicators.
*   **Danger of CPI:** Concepts can be overridden.
    *   The speaker has been wrong many times on CPI calls.
*   **Risk Management:**
    *   Respect the measure of risk.
    *   Don't interpret the speaker's analysis as a "secret handshake" to trade.
    *   Profitability on CPI release is primarily due to luck. Luck is only real when there is complete uncertainty and you happen to be on the side that works.
    *   Trading should rely on skill and experience, not luck.

---

## **Contingency Planning: Conceding a Wrong Bias**

*   **Identifying a Change in Bias:** If the market gets below the consequent encroachment of the wick, it indicates a change in the state of delivery.
*   Need to get below consequent correction of this week because that is where the state of delivery changed inside of seeing a run higher.

    *   A pool of liquidity was taken out and the price went a bit higher.
*   **Key Point:** There are times when your analysis, experience, and model will be silent.
    *   This doesn't mean the strategy is broken; it requires discipline and patience.
    *   Avoid "crack fiend" behavior – being overly eager to trade every market movement.
    *   Wait for the market to provide your setup.

---

## **Cable (GBP/USD) Analysis**

*   Cable came down inside a buy-side imbalance outside inefficiency (fair value gap).
*   **Objective:** See if the price returns back up into this gap.
    *   This indicates unfinished business.
*   **Weekly Chart Confirmation:** The inefficiency is anchored on the weekly chart.
*   **Daily Chart:** Cable has been consolidating, even after trading into the gap and showing initial willingness to go higher.
    *   The need to overcome key resistance.
*   **Important Level:** A meaningful move above a specific range.
*   **Scenario Planning:** If the price runs up, fails to reach a shaded area, and returns to the middle of the inefficiency (consequent encroachment), that could act as potential support.
*   **Post-CPI Focus:** Looking for these types of scenarios and potential setups.

---

## **NASDAQ (NQ) Analysis**

*   **Contract Month:** Now looking at the September delivery contract month (symbol: NQU2023).
    *   *Correction:* H = March, M = June, U = September, Z = December - only four contract delivery months for indexes.
*   **Weekly View:** NQ has been the strongest performer on the upside.
*   **Daily Chart:**
    *   Concerns about the sell-side, despite a recent run-up.
    *   Feels like they will make an attempt to get into the sell side this week.
    *   Anticipates a potential move into a specific sell-side area.
        *   Even if it went down there that would upset folks thinking that it's topped, and then to me if it went down below that and rallied and create another short-term inefficiency that would be bullish that could continue going higher.
*   This looks too clean.
*   **Possible Scenario:** Going lower on NQ and then rallying.

---

## **E-mini S&P 500 (ES) and Dow Futures Analysis**

*   **Relationship:** If NQ draws down, ES would likely follow.
*   Not trying to pick the top before CPI.
*   CPI is viewed as a tool to "smash" profitable positions or accelerate existing movements.
*   **Dow Futures Expectation:** Favors a run above a specific high.
    *   Dow is used as a barometer and for comparative/relative strength studies.
    *   Inefficiency identified, so if it's going to drop initially on CPI, it could go down there and then run into that area.

---

## **Gold (XAU/USD) Analysis**

*   Predicting a run for the sell-side below a specific level.
*   **Disclaimer:** "I'm probably wrong. Please don't trade it."

---


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining all details and nuances:

# **Post-CPI Market Analysis**

## **Immediate Market Reaction and Liquidity**

*   The price dropped to a **15-minute time frame** and created a small gap.
*   Buy-side liquidity rests above this gap.
*   The speaker sarcastically notes that those who traded the immediate reaction and got lucky will likely post about it on social media and offer signals.
*   The speaker identifies sell-side liquidity below.
*   He hopes the price can reach down to the sell-side before a potential upward move.
*   "So you want to trade CPI, do you?"

## **Nasdaq and Dow Analysis**

*   **Nasdaq (NQ):**
    *   Took out the sell-side liquidity.
    *   Ran for the buy-side liquidity.
*   **Dow (Daily Chart):**
    *   The speaker likes a specific high on the Dow chart.
    *   He measures the midpoint of a wick (consequent encroachment) as a first objective.
    *   Wants to see if the price will move above this high.
    *   Acknowledges the possibility of being wrong and the market moving contrary to his outlined expectations.
    *   Suggests the initial pump could feed into tomorrow's rate announcement.

## **Addressing Viewer Comments and Title Update**

*   The speaker apologizes for the missing title on the stream.
*   Acknowledges viewers mentioning the title issue.
*   Explains he doesn't know how the title gets untoggled and doesn't usually adjust it.

## **One-Minute Chart Analysis and Broker Limitations**

*   **Initial Market Movement:**
    *   The market opened.
    *   Ran slightly above the fair value gap (FVG).
    *   Slammed down to take the sell-side liquidity.
    *   Closed a one-minute candle above the buy-side liquidity *after* running for it.
    *   The speaker highlights the extreme volatility and rapid traversal of the market within a single minute.
*   **Broker Restrictions:**
    *   The speaker doubts traders can be nimble enough to trade in such conditions.
    *   Liquidity is often pulled.
    *   Real brokers won't allow such rapid trading.
*   **Scam Brokers:**
    *   He criticizes individuals showing buy and sell orders getting filled, implying they may be running "white list fake brokers" or scams.
    *   Such scenarios don't occur in the real market.
*   **Emphasis on Risk Disclosure:**
    *   While enjoying humor and banter, the speaker stresses the importance of not sugarcoating the serious aspects of risk and potential financial loss.
    *   Warns against believing claims of easy profits during high-impact events.
*   **Broker Statement Verification:**
    *   Challenges individuals claiming successful trades to provide verifiable broker statements.
    *   Specifically, he asks for proof from reputable brokers (not MT4/MT5 accounts due to potential manipulation).

## **Market Manipulation and Trading Limitations**

*   The speaker considers himself above average but acknowledges that even he cannot make his strategies work consistently in such heavily manipulated environments.
*   Describes the market as being "up against a brick wall" with trading permissions effectively denied due to speed and manipulation.
*   **Broker Advantage:**
    *   Brokers ebook a lot of people.
    *   They might be wrong, but they pay out the over-leveraged, lucky trades due to the rapid market movement's force.
*   Advises understanding and respecting the nature of the business rather than getting upset.
*   The speaker chooses to remain on the sidelines and wait for better opportunities.

## **Post-CPI Liquidity Dynamics and Mindset**

*   The current situation is described as "literally a 50/50" scenario.
*   The market has taken both sides of the liquidity after the speaker highlighted working off the fair value gap.
*   **Key Takeaway:**
    *   Focus on *how* the buy-side and sell-side were addressed.
    *   Forget being right or wrong; forget profitability in the short term.
*   **One-Minute Timeframe Focus:**
    *   The majority of the described movement occurred within a one-minute (or two-minute) timeframe.
    *   Without pre-placed limit orders, adjusting or comprehending the situation is nearly impossible.
*   **New Trader Caution:**
    *   New traders lack the experience to measure continuation or identify liquidity pools.
    *   Advises against gambling on such reports without proper knowledge.

## **Avoiding the "Get-Rich-Quick" Trap**

*   The speaker discourages viewing these market moves as easy opportunities for profit.
*   He emphasizes that believing in instantly buying the low and selling the high in these conditions is a misconception.
*   **Challenge for Verification:**
    *   He again challenges claims of successful trades, demanding verifiable proof from reputable brokers.
*   **Protecting New Traders:**
    *   The speaker aims to protect new traders from "risk of ruin" scenarios.
    *   He advocates using CPI data *after* the initial reaction, similar to his approach with non-farm payroll.
*   **Acknowledging Uncertainty:**
    *   The speaker admits to not knowing where the market will go ahead of the CPI number.
    *   He questions why inexperienced traders would believe they have an edge.
*   **Avoiding Scar Tissue:**
    *   He warns against creating negative experiences by trading prematurely.

## **Focusing on Observation and Learning**

*   The speaker emphasizes outlining *what* to look for and *how* to study the market reaction, focusing on objective analysis rather than impulsive trading.
*   **Liquidity Pool Identification:**
    *   He points out the buy-side liquidity above relative equal highs, explaining that retail traders often perceive these as strong resistance, placing stop-loss orders above them.
    *   He also identifies sell-side liquidity below relative equal lows, where sell stops are placed.
*   **Market Contention:**
    *   Both buy-side and sell-side liquidity are always in contention during high-impact news events.
*   **Jagged Edges:**
    *   Smooth edges (relative equal lows/highs) on lower timeframes will be made jagged by the market ripping through them.

## **Offsetting Positions and Market Sentiment**

*   The speaker explains how market movements can offset positions and control sentiment with orders resting below highs and above lows.
*   **Fair Value Gap Dynamics:**
    *   The market ran for both the relative equal highs and the fair value gap.
    *   It is currently staying between these two liquidity pools.
    *   Initially, the market went directly to the fair value gap.
*   **Detailed Price Action Analysis (1-second, 15-second Charts):**
    *   Using different timeframe charts the speaker broke down how the market rally and the sell side swept happened and how it looked live.

## **Potential Upward Movement and Retail Sentiment**

*   The speaker suggests a potential run higher to take out a specific high.
*   He notes the aggressive downward move and believes retail traders might try to go short.
*   **Observational Approach:**
    *   The speaker recommends observing the market with the idea of a run up to a specific wick in mind.
    *   He reiterates that this is not a trade recommendation but an exercise in "reading the tape."
*   **Value of Observation:**
    *   Gaining experience by watching price action without trading, even in a demo account, allows for developing a feel for market behavior.
    *   The speaker believes this approach would have spared him years of losses and accelerated his path to consistency.

## **Key Levels and Fair Value Gap Recap**

*   The speaker identifies specific levels (4407 and 4405) as the midpoint of a gap.
*   He advises watching to see if the market will be drawn to these levels.
*   **Main Takeaway:**
    *   Even in fast market conditions, the algorithm referred to the fair value gap and liquidity pools mentioned by the speaker.
    *   This occurred at a speed he cannot participate in.

## **Controlled Chaos and Trading Limitations**

*   Even in seemingly chaotic and reckless market conditions, the market is still being controlled.
*   However, this control is exerted in a way that makes it nearly impossible for retail traders to profit during these periods.
*   **Illusion of Opportunity:**
    *   These moves create an illusion of opportunity, tempting traders to over-leverage and chase quick profits.
    *   The speaker urges viewers not to fall for this trap.

## **High-Frequency Trading Insights and Personal Limitations**

*   The speaker highlights a consequent encroachment that would be enough to pay your bills right there.
*   **HFT Algorithms:**
    *   Illustrates how even a small move reflects the activity of high-frequency trading algorithms.
    *   Explains different types of HFT algorithms: one-sided (buy or sell models) and those that capitalize on volatility in both directions.
*   **Undisclosed Strategies:**
    *   Addresses the common question of what he *won't* teach.
    *   States that he's *not allowed* to teach certain advanced HFT strategies, and confirms he has not hidden any such strategies in his teachings.
*   **Focus on Fundamentals:**
    *   Encourages viewers to appreciate the value of the information he *does* share openly, which has demonstrably helped others.
    *   Reiterates that even without the most advanced techniques, traders can find success.
*   **Multiplier Effect:**
    *   Emphasizes the importance of finding a "multiplier" – a specific setup or reason to engage the market – combined with disciplined risk management.
*   **Risk Management Essentials:**
    *   Clearly define risk by knowing where to place stops.
    *   Establish profit targets, including partial exits and best-case scenario "terminus" exits.

## **Trading as a Craft and Constant Pursuit**

*   The speaker emphasizes that trading is a lifestyle, not just a means to make money.
*   **Excellence as a Pursuit:**
    *   Excellence is an ongoing pursuit, not a final destination.
    *   Traders should always strive to improve.
*   **Exit Strategy Challenges:**
    *   Acknowledges his own struggles with exit strategies.
    *   Admits to never being fully satisfied with his exits, despite occasional successes in exiting at the highest or lowest ticks.
*   **Continuous Learning:**
    *   Explains that his focus is always on outthinking his algorithm and finding new insights.
    *   His mind is constantly racing, making it difficult to focus.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining all details and nuances:

# **Trading Psychology, Market Analysis, and High-Frequency Trading Insights**

## **The Importance of Focus and Avoiding Distractions**

*   The speaker emphasizes his need for intense focus while trading.
*   He avoids distractions, including conversations, even with his son, because they disrupt his train of thought.
*   He likens his distractibility to "a dog sees a squirrel."
*   He acknowledges that some traders may be able to multitask effectively, but he cannot.

## **Managing Multiple Market Opportunities**

*   The speaker describes having a multitude of market observations simultaneously, "80 plus things that are jumping off the chart."
*   He compares his experience to "a dog in a meat market," overwhelmed by choices.
*   He sees opportunities for small and large price movements in both directions (e.g., a three-handle run, a 10-handle run, an eight-handle reversal).
*   He chooses one observation to focus on, often based on whether he is teaching or explaining something.
*   He frequently regrets not pursuing other opportunities that he identifies.

## **The Illusion of Knowledge Overload**

*   The speaker argues that divulging all his trading knowledge would not necessarily make others better traders.
*   He compares it to asking a parent which child is their favorite – an impossible question.
*   It's difficult to choose one opportunity over another when trading.
*   Even when committed to a trade, his mind is constantly evaluating other potential opportunities and models.
*   This internal conflict is a major distraction.

## **The Power of Simplicity: Focusing on Direction**

*   The speaker defends his decision not to teach everything he knows.
*   He believes traders only need to focus on one thing: **predicting where price is going to go**.
*   Knowing the direction simplifies entries and allows traders to hold onto their positions with less frustration.
*   He contrasts this with live streamers who boast about their successes but later lament their inability to hold winning trades.
*   He emphasizes that lower timeframes are useful for entry and risk management but shouldn't be the sole basis for a trade.

## **The Importance of Displacement and Timeframe Comfort**

*   Traders need movement and displacement – a change from one price to another over a period of time.
*   The ideal timeframe depends on individual comfort levels.
*   Some traders may prefer holding trades overnight, while others are uncomfortable holding for more than 10 minutes.
*   The speaker clarifies that neither approach is inherently bad.
*   Impatient traders may thrive on intraday charts using one-minute timeframes, entering and exiting quickly.
*   However, they may miss larger moves and experience regret.
*   He wishes he had understood these barriers when he began trading.

## **Analyzing a 15-Second Chart: High-Frequency Trading**

*   The speaker transitions to analyzing a 15-second chart.
*   He notes that most viewers likely don't have access to 15-second charts on TradingView.
*   He explains what a high-frequency trading (HFT) algorithm entry might look like on a buy model.
*   He previously outlined a likely draw up into the consequent encroachment of a wick on the 15-second chart and then potentially to a higher level.
*   His expected draw is based on anticipating retail traders’ behavior, specifically those who see a high-low break and retest and try to go lower.
*   He states that the algorithm is running on the expectation to trap those specific traders.
*   Those traders would place their stops just above the high and algorithm will go for those stops.
*   The speaker criticizes reliance on gimmicks like depth of market readings, deeming them unhelpful and faith-based.
*   He identifies a shorting opportunity for the sell-side: a run into an inefficiency (order block).
*   He reminds viewers that he previously predicted a move higher based on second charts.
*   The speaker mocks others who create books and courses because they will never make predictions based on 15 second charts.

## **Dissecting Market Structure and Order Blocks**

*   The speaker defines an **order block** as a change in the state of delivery, not simply a zone.
*   He emphasizes that not every down-closed candle is an order block.
*   The down closed candle with a larger body is used because it has recorded more time and duration at its extremes and that makes it an order block.
*   He identifies a swing high and notes that a trade above it signifies a **shift in market structure**.
*   This triggers HFT algorithms to focus on the buy side.
*   Chaos HFT algorithms will trade both directions, capitalizing on the inefficiency and retracement to the opening price.
*   He states that you will never see anyone calling this stuff live other than himself.
*   The speaker highlights that a high-probability order block will have a fair value gap.
*   He clarifies that this is a refinement, teaching narrative logic framework.
*   He is contrasting the concept of a long wick with a fair value gap is not a contradiction.

## **The Importance of Understanding Liquidity and Narrative**

*   The speaker discusses the initial liquidity grab after CPI.
*   He clarifies that opening price opened at 8:30.
*   The market initially traded up, stopped short, then moved down to take the sell-side.
*   The key is to understand which side of the marketplace the algorithm targeted first.
*   Smart money players wait for this signature because it tells them the likely direction.
*   He states that he is the one stepping out and teaching and he is not supposed to be doing these things.
*   He compares it to a marketing tactic, where if he were asked, he would say he is teaching Pepsi but not Coke.
*   Delivery was to sell-side first, so smart money waits for the signature because it tells them the direction since they will run to sell-side.
*   This informs his belief that the market will move higher.
*   The market ran for the sell-side first, then quickly repriced away from it.

## **Prolonged Movement to Buy Side: Order and Sentiment**

*   He points out that the market doesn't need to return to the consequent encroachment because it already ran for the sell-side.
*   How price delivers after the second pool of liquidity is engaged is important.
*   The move will likely be prolonged and more prominent to the buy side.
*   It upsets orders and sentiment by the initial drop.
*   It creates a false shorting opportunity, trapping traders who see a few handles of profit.
*   The market only reprices to the opening price at 8:30.
*   The speaker describes this as "all controlled."
*   The algorithm receives information and retraces to the opening price.
*   It creates a short-term shift in market structure, a down-closed candle, and a bullish order block.
*   The range between the high and low of this candle is the dealing range.
*   As long as the high or low are not breached, everything within the range is insignificant.
*   The speaker is targeting the high and the buy-side above it.
*   Candles within the described range mean nothing because the return from the fair value gap has already happened.
*   He is showing viewers why they need to watch somebody like him so they can trust him that he will teach them the market.
*   The market rallies into the inefficiency and trades down to offer delivery to the order block.
*   Then, time is spent marking time in 15-second candles.
*   All of the price action from the start of the candle to the other candle is an order block.
*   He specifies it is a propulsion block.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining all details and nuances:

# **Market Analysis, Algorithmic Behavior, and Trading Insights**

## **Understanding Price Action Within a Range**

*   "My mindset in focus is inside this range; everything is happening inside."
*   The speaker indicates indifference to price action *within* a defined range.
*   He states, "I could care less because my mind is already established what the algorithm is going to refer back to is this signature here I've coded."
*   He coded a signature that shows him the behaviors of the algorithm.
*   All price action *within* this range is considered irrelevant.
    *   "So all of this price action here is irrelevant. It's just marking time."
*   It merely reflects price movement within a specific interval.
    *   "Where prices moved in that interval, the highest and the lowest in the beginning and the ending, that's all it's doing."
*   His focus as a trader and analyst is on observing *this* range.
    *   "But my mind as a Trader and the analyst is I'm looking at inside this range here."
*   He anticipates the range holding and eventually breaking upwards.
    *   "I want to see this range maintain itself and then eventually break to the upside, which we get right there."
*   The price draws towards a previously indicated target.
    *   "Where does it draw to? Where I told you here."
*   The price halts and consolidates, returning to an order block.
    *   "And then what does it do? It stops and then consolidates. What's it doing? What is it doing folks? Think the order block it trades down to it it's spending time down here."

## **Exclusive Knowledge and Algorithmic Manipulation**

*   The speaker believes the knowledge he imparts is not publicly shared.
    *   "For Traders that understand what I'm teaching you that they're not going to go out there in public and raise their hand say you know yeah ICT you know is right you know this is what we do they don't want me teaching it to you trust me they don't want me teaching this."
*   He attributes his understanding to divine intervention.
    *   "So I it took a great deal of prayer and answered prayer to have this shown to me in charts so that way I can convey what it is that's happening outside the chart."
*   He acknowledges limitations in what he can teach.
    *   "The algorithm is not only doing what I'm showing you in candlesticks there are other things that I know that I can't teach because there's no way for me to bridge that gap between what you can see in a chart like I can't."
    *   "I can't say okay if it does this this is what it doesn't work like that so there's only a limitation of what it is I'm willing to share with you and you have to be content with that."
*   He emphasizes the advanced nature of his teachings.
    *   "But I promise you if you just take a step back and look at what is I'm showing you it's light years way way way Beyond everything else."
*   He claims his insights go beyond conventional market wisdom.
    *   "You don't need to have this much degree of understanding but what do you think is occurring in here?"
*   He says the algorithm allows time for "real smart money" to enter positions.
    *   "The algorithm is allowing time for Traders that are in the know that are real smart money they're not Wyckoff Traders they're not supplying demand guys they're not Goldman Sachs guys okay they don't know this stuff I promise you they don't know this."
*   These traders accumulate orders before the algorithm reprices.
    *   "It's allowing them to get their orders in before the algorithm reprices then it goes to your first point of reference which is the consequent encroachment this Wick here stops and then spends time what's it doing allowing them to build a larger position what's the model where where's price being drawn to higher."
*   As the price rises, they distribute their initial entries, while new algorithm entries occur.
    *   "So allows them to accumulate more Longs and then as it runs up they're Distributing it all their initial entries in here they're selling it some in here and then new algorithm entries are in here killing more and as it runs up they sell sell sell sell sell sell and that provides liquidity."
*   He describes a constant interplay between inefficiencies and liquidity.
    *   "So there's this dance that's always occurring between inefficiencies and liquidity premium to Discount discounted premium always that's what's current."
*   He dismisses retail trading concepts and indicators as irrelevant.
    *   "It has nothing to do with harmonics has nothing to do with animal patterns has nothing to do with Elliott wave has nothing to do with anything that you see in a retail book price is not moving on any of that that's not what's going on folks in buying and selling pressure is not it that is not it."
*   He criticizes reliance on gimmicks like market profile and level 2 data.
    *   "Your Market profile your volume bar is turned vertical okay so you're you're looking at them over here okay you're looking at that and you're looking at level two data and you think that that makes you smart or that makes you in the know that is a gimmick it's a red herring you're looking at stuff and you're not seeing the things I'm showing you."
*   He presents his analysis on a 15-second chart.
    *   "I'm showing it to you in a 15 second chart think about it 15 seconds prices behaving in a way in which it's been coded it's behaving as it's told it's not being pushed around because buyers and sellers that's not what's occurring here folks."
*   He suggests most traders are ignorant of the true market dynamics.
    *   "Sorry if that hurt your feelings I'm sure some of you worked in an industry and you feel like you know you're you're part of the team and all but you know you have a title that you have an ignorance you have no idea what makes these Mars go up and down and I'm not I don't care about titles."

## **One-Minute Chart Analysis and Algorithmic Distribution**

*   Opening price is noted, followed by a move down and a rally.
    *   "So one minute here we have it opening price we trade down to it here rally up consolidate around what's it working in here on the one minute chart main threshold rally consolidate allow smart trade smart money to accumulate more longs and displace into the upside."
*   The market creates short-term highs, with HFT algorithms distributing positions above them.
    *   "Now look what's occurring here we're getting short-term highs we run above it short term High run above it when it starts doing this and you watch me do this many times and I just did it again yesterday in my trade for ES when it starts creating these short-term highs every time it runs above that in your long high frequency trading algorithms are dumping portions of their position above that that's why I do it okay I'm in there doing the same thing that these entities are told to do when they work with this algorithm and if they're doing it they're doing it because it's a purpose in mind they're offset distribution."
*   He states that the algorithms are offsetting distribution after accumulating long positions.
    *   "If they had accumulated long positions in here and in here how do they how do they exit short-term highs move away from it above that high is going to be by side sell to this buy side creates a short-term high retraces back down increasing short-term High when it runs above it again sell offset distribute offset they're long positions and distribute them to willing buyers where are the Willing buyers above market price."
*   He attributes willing buyers above the market price to retail traders using gimmicks.
    *   "Every time you create a short-term High somebody in there some Joker okay some clown that there believes that Elliott leaves and animal patterns move the market around they're in there trying to trade their little gimmicks and they're trying to go short so if they're going short they're going to try to do what they're going to use an order that they think is protective a short position they use a buy stop where are they going to place that buy stock above the recent swing High."
*   He emphasizes narrative reading to predict price movement.
    *   "So using narrative reading where price is going to go why it should go there when it will consolidate and pause I've taught you that live today I've taught you I've literally sat down here with you and told you."
*   He says he cannot give exact setups before events like CPI.
    *   "Now did I tell you exactly how to do it right before CPI no because I have to wait and see what it does what does it leave it leaves Clues all the time but I have to wait to see what it will run for."
*   He emphasizes waiting for reference points before analysis.
    *   "I can't call the high and the low of the day until midnight in New York but if I'm doing analysis and I'm talking to someone they say hey what do you think about this and what do you think about that if I don't have the reference points that's required at midnight I can only talk about what I know based on the information that's being shown in the information that we have available at that time when we have these high impact or medium impact drivers that come out in the marketplace I have to wait for the potential for manual intervention."
*   He states intervention manifested as opening above fair value, then dropping for sell-side liquidity.
    *   "Manual intervention is here we initially opened ran above the fair value then dropped for sell signs so think about what I taught you we outlined real time before the market delivered where the liquidity would be and the inefficiency that would be utilized it opened ran up just above it let's go back down to the 15 second chart oops I gotta change it oh yeah that we opened rallied above that fair value Gap I outlined then ran for the sell side then it ripped higher for the buy sign."
*   He says such a move would typically occur over a longer period without high-impact news.
    *   "The fact that it ran to the fair bag Gap here then to the sell side in itself if it was not a high impact news driver like this that type of run would have happened over the morning session and a later run in the afternoon would have been this move here at the buy side."
*   He blames brokers and liquidity providers for manipulating access to the market.
    *   "But because of the removal of liquidity believe me there are people that want to trade this but Brokers and liquidity providers they pull access away from the marketplace that's intervention that's manipulation that is a barrier to you being profitable whether you like it or not it's gonna happen and that's what they do around non-farm payroll too and they say oh there's a there's a an absence of liquidity not because it's organic believe me there's people that want to trade they think they're going to have something that is profitable during this whole move they created some kind of thing with a moving average crossover and they want to trade it they believe it's going to make them rich no it's prevented because these types of moves offer a lot of movement in a very short span of time and somebody could be really wrong by by accident make a lot of movement in terms of profit in the broker if they're be booking them they have to take that hit they don't want that that's the reality of this business folks okay they're not going to come out and say yeah that's right it's true you're going to hear people come out and say oh he's full of he's a liar."
*   He challenges others to show predictions on a 15-second chart.
    *   "Who's out here showing you what the Market's going to do in a 15 second chart you gotta look man if someone is saying something and they can't bring it and show receipts then okay then then don't trust that person but if someone's willing to sit out here live and explain all the mechanics before it happens either they know what they're talking about or they had something to do with it and I'd leave that up to you you decide if I'm full of you'll know if I'm not you'll know."
*   He says the sell-side liquidity was taken first, discouraging longs.
    *   "But after the fact how we treated what was the first pool Equity that was written the sell side now think about if you were long or any Trader that was long if this report ran down and hit that stop loss would you be willing to get back in to go along be honest now chances are no you wouldn't and that's why they do it they run for the liquidity on the side that they don't want to want oh no let me say it right they run for the liquidity first on the side that they want to make sure they scare out of entering and being on the right side so it's the first run on liquidity on medium or high impact news drivers that tends to be the side that would be the winning side if they wait then you see the buy side taken after but you have to wait you have to wait."
*   Price pulls back inside the range between the two pools of liquidity.
    *   "What does it want to do it pulls back inside the range what range between the two pools of liquidity that's this line here and this line here let me thicken them up."

## **Range Definition, Liquidity, and Algorithmic Behavior**

*   He acknowledges Twitter followers and asks for engagement.
    *   "If you're on Twitter and you follow me on Twitter if you like what I'm teaching and this is resonating with you give me a hell yeah like the cuss to say heck yeah okay so these these two reference points that's their that's your range okay so after took the cell side out and then by side it pulled back into the range."
*   The two liquidity pools define a specific range.
    *   "Now both of those pools of liquidity Define a very specific range for liquidity purposes we outlined buy side was above here and sell side was below here the algorithm knows both those points of reference just like I showed it to you live before it was being used where'd it go to consequent encouragement right in the middle range Low Range High liquidity above it liquidity below it pulls back to consequent encroachment the bias I gave you is going higher would it reach for the first draw here and then we wait does it want to take the buy side here then we went into high high high what I tell you offset distribution algorithm starts selling and offsetting their long position and every time it takes out a high they're doing that distribution they're selling to those buy stops what did it do after that we're off the highs."
*   He contrasts his foresight with cherry-picking accusations.
    *   "Listen folks I don't know what you call foresight versus cherry picking okay I don't know where you're from what your culture is and beliefs about things but when someone says something and it happens it's it's pretty set in stone that either it works or it doesn't and if you can't see this like really there's nothing else there's nothing else I can do that make you understand that these things are driven 100 controlled."
*   He points out a wick inside the range on the one-minute chart.
    *   "Well one minute chart take this film off here so in all this business notice that uh this Wick here I went inside the range between that high and that close with that 15 second chart so you might have a measurement of consequent encroaching on this Wick here that's fine but in Nest Wick I want to be in the lower time frame very very small time frames and I just showed you Precision with 15 second charts."
*   He describes how to omit specific candles using 15-second charts for precision.
    *   "I told you how to omit and don't even refer to specific candles that's that's one of the arguments that people will say they'll say hey uh you know time based charts or nonsense they're garbage you know this that that's someone that doesn't believe number one there's a nail Rhythm too doesn't believe that you can use the element of time as the most influential factor in price delivery because everything around price delivery is first controlled and delivered by a schedule it's time it's time and price Theory time and price Theory not price and some gimmicks okay I know how to use a time-based chart because I know time I know the time when the algorithm is going to behave I know what it's likely to follow and then I also know how to Omit certain candles don't pay attention to certain ones and that's the Folly that I see people over the years they've taken things in look at this older blocks don't work because they'll point to down closed candles that aren't being respected you have no idea what an order block is and the folks that are making YouTube videos the simple way of using order blocks the best order block you don't know what an order block is take those videos down it's embarrassing stop okay seriously stop."

## **Accumulation, Distribution, and Trading Psychology**

*   He questions the logic of accumulating long positions.
    *   "So I wanna ask you point blank if you see a reason to be accumulating a long position in here and in here and the market gives you all the signatures in here we understand this this pattern here is a three drives pattern or as Linda Rask and Larry Connors wrote in their book Street smarts which I love and adore that book not everything in that book I subscribe to but it was one of the very influential manuscripts that taught me how to view stop hunts like that that book rung in the first introduction to victimizing Traders where when I got stopped out I just said well you know that system didn't work or I did it wrong and I would beat myself up emotionally and psychologically and wreck myself you know constantly about how I did that wrong not knowing that one of the primary functions of the market is to go to where liquidity is and if you're wrong obviously you know you're the liquidity."
*   He reflects on early trading struggles and victimhood.
    *   "So when I first started that's how it was for me and maybe that's where you're at in your development right now maybe you're you're struggling because every time you participate maybe sooner than you should even with the demo you're getting stopped out and you're getting frustrated and just know that I went through that for years I know you see the things that I do and teach and show and call in them real time too and there's it can't be a time when ICT was a noob there was there really was and I was the poster boy for it like I blew accounts like crazy I did it in stunning fashion okay if you're gonna do it and do it right I was the that was the best one at doing it every possible thing that would have caused me to blow an account I did it recklessness greed impatience um system hopping testing stupidity seeing if certain things that you know I had a hunch about none of it was helpful."
*   He credits Larry Williams with providing an initial framework.
    *   "And then because of the pain of losing money and the ideas that initially came from Larry Williams you know his uh uh confidential trading course for future millionaires or something that effect you know I've heard you heard me talk about it many times that that gave me a framework to start looking at the market differently whereas I was always jumping around and while I don't use the things that he teaches or taught then predominantly I still believe that that would be a wonderful starting point for someone like to uh to know how to look at price in the beginning but I there's a lot of stuff that he does that's indicator."


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining all details and nuances:

# **Mentorship, Market Perspectives, and Trading Psychology**

## **Early Mentors and Trading Beginnings**

*   The speaker expresses affection for **Larry Williams**, calling him his "first real mentor."
*   He clarifies that while **Ken Roberts** was a paid mentor, his **Uncle Stan** introduced him to trading at a young age (14-15).
    *   "If I was honest it would be Ken Roberts was there well not not technically it's really my uncle my uncle Stan was my first Mentor he's the one that was talking me into trading when I was 14 15 years old and I really wasn't interested showing me charts and stuff."
*   He purchased **Ken Roberts'** "World's Most Powerful Money Manual" which sparked the idea of quitting his job and retiring.
*   His initial financial goal was modest: \$1,000 per month.
    *   "I bought his world's most powerful money manual course and it was about trading Commodities and uh very very poor presentation of the marketplace but it made me think I could quit my job in Uber it's a span of 20 years I could you know retire I started fleshing out this whole idea of getting rich long term and uh if I could make a thousand dollars a month that would get me there that's how I first started."
*   He contrasts this with the "Lamborghini lifestyle" promoted on social media, emphasizing that success takes time.
    *   "Now contrast that with what you see on Instagram and YouTube and Twitter and discords and everything else that's out there it's real fast Lamborghini lifestyle you know get rich real quick and at this you know it's unfortunate because you shouldn't be thinking like that but it's going to take you a lot longer than you want them believe it will just know that."
*   He acknowledges making mistakes trying to improve his initial successful strategies.
    *   "I knew how to do most of what I'm doing here um the first three and a half years but then I started to Tinker with improving it and made more mistakes and just went back to what I had arrived at."
*   He attributes his unique insights to a combination of information and chance encounters.
    *   "With that information coupled with chance meetings with people you're not ever going to meet that combination of insight you know makes me who I am in a circle Trader ICT now the guy."

## **Defining Trading Success and Contentment**

*   He urges listeners to consider their desired level of contentment and trading goals.
    *   "I want you to think about what level of contentment do you require are you trading to be the best social media Trader are you training to be the guy that makes the biggest pit haul or Point Hall the guy that tries to get the highest high and the lowest level what is it that you're trying to do."
*   He cautions against being unprepared for the psychological impact of making large sums of money.
    *   "Some of you think that you want to make millions of dollars and I'm gonna be honest with you it's scary sometimes when you're making big money and you're probably not prepared for that I'm going to be honest you're not prepared for that nobody is when you start making big money it's a weird feeling you think it's going to be like easy it's not because it's intoxicating you think that every Big Win is going to be available every single time you get into a new trade and you gotta control you have to control that impulse."
*   He emphasizes the importance of controlling impulses and understanding market dynamics.
    *   "Smart money distributed real time I was explaining it to you and look where we're drawing downtown to the high end of that but I saw the quarterly pool that's this over here and the lows are over here."

## **Addressing Critics and Teaching Philosophy**

*   He defends his real-time market analysis against accusations of cherry-picking.
    *   "When I show examples I'm doing you know entries and stuff and the guys out there that are trying to sell their black box they hate the fact that I'm able to do it and they want to say it's cherry-picked and I can't trade and my students don't make money and do what they do."
*   He asserts the logic and genuine nature of his teachings.
    *   "I'm not afraid to be out here and doing this and calling it the logic is real the authorship is genuine and it repeats it's something that's transferable and when I'm outlining what it should do and how it should behave I'm leaning on elements that you aren't able to know and I'm trying to teach by example with experience and repetition for the folks that really want to learn how to do it you can get it from what I'm teaching you can get the very thing that you're looking for."
*   He criticizes superficial goals like social media fame, advocating for financial independence and generational wealth.
    *   "If you're trying to be the thought the most followed Trader I should run into that right there you're trying to do all those things they're they're superficial they don't mean anything doesn't mean making money being able to take care of yourself and your family and build generational wealth that way you can transfer this information once you learn it it's yours it's your skill set."

## **Parenting and Trading: Managing Expectations**

*   He discusses the challenges of teaching his own children to trade, acknowledging their lack of initial interest.
    *   "You'll probably be met with the same thing that my own kids have and because all of you think out there man ict's kids they should be so good at trading and this and that other thing they're kids just like I was I wasn't interested when I was 14 and 15 years old my uncle was trying to tell me he had made money I didn't give a I didn't care it didn't mean anything to me I wanted to be a kid and that's where my kids are and I'm trying not to rush them because believe me I want them to know how to do this and they just are kids they're this their children at heart still and even my 20 year olds you know they're still trying to find themselves and my daughter's completely lost she's Perpetual student college kid because she doesn't want to embrace adulthood and go out there and fail and I'm her golden parachute that keeps protecting her."
*   He describes his daughter as a "perpetual student" avoiding adulthood.

## **Market Analysis: Levels and Liquidity**

*   He observes a down-close candle, noting whether it will be respected as support.
    *   "Don't close candle yeah so far respecting that to see how if we get up into this area here till we get above it and treat us support."
*   He identifies buy-side liquidity above a high on a daily chart.
    *   "Initially we have worked into this high so there's buy side here so that's what we're looking at also on how the market was reaching into those short-term highs."
*   He explains smart money's distribution of long positions above short-term highs.
    *   "I'll tell you this um a smart money offset distributes their position when they're long so look at this High here."
*   He identifies the next important level as the inefficiency inside a fair value gap on a weekly chart.
    *   "This High here the next important level above here is inside of this inefficiency right there."
*   He identifies **4428** as the consequent encroachment level, derived from a specific inefficiency, emphasizing it's a precise level, not a range.
    *   "So 44.28 okay so 4428 is consequent encouragement and again I'll just throw this in here because invariably I know some of you are like can you show me your FIB settings it's the first time I watched your video and that's an extension okay so there's your ICT FIB settings [Music] rewind the video if you want to see it again so consequent crunch is midpoint and that's above this High here so buy side that would rest above here so buy stops who have advice up about that long-term hedge fund Traders big large funds rated here 44.28 okay that's the midpoint of this candle's low and this candle is high and that inefficiency here is a fair value Gap what kind of fair value you got City sell side imbalance buy side inefficiency meaning that if the market were to efficiently reprice to this it would be doing it with a run higher we've only had one pass through on the downside with this candle here between this candle is low and this candle is high we have a partial run into it here but we now have exposure still with inefficiency between this candle's low and this candle is high so what I'm saying is if we look at it like this that's the only real at this moment inefficiency that resides in that old gap between here and here but not a Zone I look at very specific price levels the 50 level of this inefficiency here that is consequent encroachment at 4428 so that's a real level it's not some range it's a very specific level."
*   He also identifies **4441** as a consequent encroachment level.
    *   "Now because we have this range between this high in this candle's low that's shaded in blue I would do the same thing with that so that we would have a consequent quotient level of 4441 so I have 44.41 is a key level to the upside and 4428 they should be on your charts how you note them is your business I have it written in my notes and so piece of paper that key levels you know I have you know notations of what time frame they're anchored to that's it so me showing you that it would mean nothing to you but shown you in the chart like this and teaching it I'm already always teaching the levels I'm interested in anyway every time I'm doing analysis or whatever but that's how I'm referring to upside and where it might draw to but we just poked our head above this old high."
*   He points out how smart money sells longs above these highs, creating a three drives high formation.
    *   "Let's go back down in that one minute chart remember I was counseling you to look at how we were going higher higher and higher smart money that went long in here and down in here they would be selling their long positions above this high above this high and that's how you get your three drives High formation okay which is retail pattern it's wonderful but how do you know when it forms everything I've outlined here this morning I told you and brought your attention to it right when it was forming is that cherry-picked I'll leave that up to you just uh so I would like to see how we behave at this Gap right here do we go through it like a hot knife through butter and go into this buy side or do we run above it come back down and act as support and then run which a little bit more sustained run could manifest itself if it did it that way."

## **Fair Value Gaps and Price Action Analysis**

*   He analyzes price action within a five-minute fair value gap, noting how bodies and wicks interact with the gap across different timeframes.
    *   "So we had what was that five minute yeah so we had our five minute Gap I told you to watch that there went higher but inside this range of this Wick okay let's go through that four minute three minute two minute one minute did you notice how the bodies except for the four minute look it again here's one minute look where the bodies were they going inside the fair value Gap no just the wickwork how about the two minute look where the bodies were the Wicks went down to offer what the inefficiency that was in here what is it inefficient South Side delivery it's a buy side imbalance cell side and efficiency busy it is a fair value Gap by classification but specifics it's a buy side and balance outside efficiency meaning that it will likely need to drop into that again offering repricing once we leave that range becomes what it's a balanced price range let's go into three minutes look where the body stopped here in four minute see what's happening there the Wicks are doing damage but it's off offering the sell side but the wicks and bodies are not both inside that fair Vegas so what's it telling you it's likely to go higher which is why I told you I would like to see how it trades to this and if it goes above it events that the draw on here is what we're looking for but if it goes above it here but falls short of this high does it act as support."
*   He states a preference of not hearing his water bottle crackling and calling himself a rebel.
    *   "Let me see these flaring their own colors let me see I'll just do this I always tell myself that pour my water into a a cup that we don't hear my water bottle crackling but I never remember to do it such a rebel there you go buy side so we didn't get a return back into offer a support which would have been a nice little area to study for entry but we did get the Fairbank as I mentioned here let's go up into our climate chart."

## **Fibonacci Extensions and Trading Management**

*   He explains using Fibonacci extensions to project potential price targets after a run, emphasizing the importance of taking partials.
    *   "So now how far can it go ICT when I have these types of runs what I like to use the FIB for I'll take the FIB anchor it to the low draw up to this high and pull up the extensions okay this will be first partial assuming that you would like if you're looking at Price action whether you back test it and it's already happened like when you go to work and come home later on you're watching this video or you're at school or if you're waking up again you're sleeping while it's being live you go back through the data like this and you look at the price swings like this you measure it one half of one standard deviation or negative 0.5 that's always going to be a partial no matter how you trade whether if it's this time frame or another if you have an extension that offers you profitability I don't care if it's not even five handles you have to learn to take something there when you're first brand new at learning how to do this because it will reward you and allow you to graduate into trusting trusting yourself trusting price action and measuring when it doesn't reach it how often does it not reach it versus how many times it does."
*   He describes the negative one standard deviation as the measured move of the low up to the high added to that high projected up.
    *   "And then what you're seeing here was negative one standard deviation which is really the measured move of this low up to this High added to this High projected up so in other words if you were to take this movement from here to here duplicate it from this high projected up that's what this negative standard deviation of one is so it's a perfect measurement I like to look at how we have traded also so let's assume for the moment and play Devil's Advocate that we were long in here and we rallied up and we took partials here and we wanted to trade the daily range not trade the session when I'm doing my examples I'm teaching you how to trade that particular session so I'm moving my stop up to protect the open profits for that particular session which is what you watch me do yesterday and you see me do in last Thursday's example so I showed you both of those positions working what the long side why because my higher time frame analysis that I've been sharing with you has been calling es higher why because it's going to trade in sympathy to NASDAQ even though NASDAQ I told you was to be was going to be the leader how do you manage the impulsiveness that comes in with not being in the strongest one because either you didn't know it or you did it by error I'm teaching you how to not even concern yourself with that so if I've already told you that NASDAQ was the leader on the upside but I'm going to teach you with the medium of the es and mini s p cynics will say oh well you you didn't trade in in queue so you're not even following your model no I'm teaching you and those individuals that will struggle with the idea that they didn't trade NASDAQ when it was the strongest one because they didn't know or was told by me after November of this year I won't be telling you these things so you have to lean on your own experience and what you know so while it can be frustrating that you're not in the faster running Market it doesn't matter because you can still find you can still find setups so by having this outlined ex you know experience where we know that the Market's likely to draw on these higher time frame premium arrays that means it's going to go up how do I engage with it well how do I teach you first start looking for one good setup per week just find one good setup not an everyday setup because if you can find a setup that you can find once a week that same model that same approach that you use for that one setup that you've been waiting for for one period of trading inside of."
*   He teaches how to manage trades even when not in the strongest market (e.g., ES instead of NASDAQ).
*   He advises focusing on finding one good setup per week.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining all details and nuances:

# **Trading Discipline, Market Dynamics, and Trade Management**

## **Building Discipline and Self-Control**

*   By focusing on **one good setup per week**, traders can "forge discipline [and] self-control."
*   This approach allows for experience-building, which can then be applied to smaller timeframes to find more opportunities.
*   He acknowledges the existence of **silver bullets** at various times but emphasizes the importance of knowing the market's likely direction for consistency.
    *   "Silver bullets exist in many runs, but I just gave you a very specific time when they form every day, but unless you know where the Market's going to go it's highly unlikely that you're going to be consistent with it because you're just going to be guessing."
*   He cautions against prematurely identifying fair value gaps without understanding the broader market context.
    *   "...you're gonna look at every little separation between three candles and think it's a fair value got that it's an entry on and it's not you still have to know where the Market's likely to go to."

## **Stop Loss Placement and Consequent Encroachment**

*   Using the example of a long position, he explains stop-loss placement in a non-CPI (normal) day scenario.
*   Even if the market revisits the consequent encroachment, the stop should remain below the opening price.
    *   "Your stop would have to be below that, but ICT earlier you said it doesn't need to go down it doesn't need to go down there, but it can revisit the consequent encouragement it can..."
*   News events like CPI and Non-Farm Payroll can increase volatility.
*   For conservative stop-loss placement when trading the daily range, the stop should be below the minimum consequent encroachment.
*   Specific stop-loss level: **4388.25**, close to **4387.25** (the low end of the sell-side liquidity).
    *   "So stop loss would have to be below 43 88 and a quarter which is so close in proximity to 43.87 and a quarter which is the low end where I told you the sell side look what being resided..."
*   He advises traders to understand and consider the existing liquidity pools (buy-side and sell-side) when placing stop losses.

## **Day Trading vs. Intraday Scalping (Session Trading)**

*   **Day trading** is defined as position trading for the daily range, aiming to capture the "lion's portion" of the move from open to close.
*   **Intraday scalping** or **session trading** involves multiple entries and exits, often within the same hour or two, focusing on smaller moves within a specific session (London, New York AM/PM).
*   He clarifies that recent examples focus on session trading, capitalizing on moves within specific sessions.
*   To capture larger price runs, he recommends wider stop losses, placed below the opening price.
*   He notes that tight stop management often leads to stops being hit.
    *   "...it always comes with a price invariably if you Trail your stop loss it will be hit eventually it will absolutely be hit."

## **Managing Trades and Reducing Exposure**

*   Even with wider stops, taking partial profits throughout the day reduces overall exposure.
*   He argues there is "no need" for price to revisit certain low-end ranges after liquidity has been taken.
    *   "...there's no need for it to come back down here it's already done the damage and Traders are not going to be wanting to go in here go long because they've seen this big wick down here and it whipped here now they're scared and they don't understand what you're being taught..."
*   The "first run on liquidity is the tip" suggesting that the best time to go long is after sell stops have been taken.
    *   "...the best time to go along is after sell stops have been taken."

## **Daily Bias and Weekly Chart Analysis**

*   Daily bias starts with understanding the likely direction of the weekly chart (up or down).
*   Intraday dips on smaller timeframes (1, 3, 5 minutes) often present new buying opportunities in alignment with the weekly bias.
*   Even as a day trader, keeping a stop loss below the low end of the range (where sell-side liquidity was taken) is viable.
*   Partial profits should be taken above previous highs.

## **Lunch Hour Liquidity Runs**

*   **Lunch Hour Macro**: Runs on liquidity often target stops of profitable traders during the New York lunch hour (12:00-1:30 PM local time).
*   These runs often take out the lows formed before 11:00 AM or noon.
*   He encourages listeners to backtest this phenomenon in their charts.
    *   "Don't believe me go into your charts and see if it's what's going on...I want you to go into the charts and back test and look at that stuff because you will see it..."

## **Homework and Continued Learning**

*   He acknowledges that the information might feel disjointed to new listeners.
*   He encourages viewers to review old price movements using the reference points provided.
*   He outlined live, the levels of liquidity on both sides and the framework with the fair value gap.
*   He told of his bullish sentiment.
    *   "I didn't say we're topping just means that we're looking for the 9 30 opening okay what is it going to run for and I told you I want to see how it behaves at this very value Gap and we're down here and we would want to see it run for the buy side which it did the longer term draw the 4428 I think the first one was okay so that's Costco encroachment of the old weekly City okay so have that on your chart so 4428 and uh treat that going forward into the rest of the week and study how we deliver if at all it may not get to get up there this week it doesn't have to do it this week but I'm looking for it to graduate towards those levels have outlined on the weekly chart nothing says that we are making a high score that we've topped."
*   Specific levels mentioned: **4428** (consequent encroachment of the old weekly sell-side inefficiency).
*   He encourages study of price delivery around these levels.
*   He emphasizes that nothing indicates a market top.
*   He highlights the importance of journaling and building experience by studying old moves.
*   Observing price action (tape reading) without trading (demo or live) is critical.
*   He never tells anyone when to start trading with real money; traders will know when they are consistently profitable and unemotional.
*   Profitability should be consistent and outweigh losses.
*   He said that he thinks this presentation was insightful.

Okay, here's the organized and refined version of the provided text.  I've aimed to retain every detail, nuance, and the original tone while structuring it for better readability and comprehension.

# **ICT Workshop: A Comprehensive Guide to Learning and Application**

**Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx15_eN9sxI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx15_eN9sxI)

## **Introduction: Overcoming Obstacles and Setting the Stage**

Good morning, folks! The enemy (referring to challenges and obstacles) is trying to prevent you from learning today. There were some technical difficulties getting started:

*   Almost choked on bone broth.
*   Audio issues.
*   Apologies for being tardy due to circumstances outside of my control.

Checking Twitter to ensure audio is good; confirmation appreciated. The title may be incorrect (possibly dated for Friday); today is Thursday. No time travel... yet (maybe after November).

I had a spontaneous idea to do a workshop, instead of the usual long-winded Twitter spaces. I promise that if you're here to learn, you *will* learn a lot today. We're going to cover these topics:

*   Fair Value Gaps
*   Price Delivery
*   Time of Day Bias
*   Daily Bias
*   Session Bias
*   Stops: Where to look for them
*   Backtesting Techniques
*   And More

**The goal:** Provide insight so you don't need gimmicks or paid subscriptions. All you need is the Open High Low Close data.

We'll work from higher timeframes down to lower timeframes. I can't promise I won't go on rants.

**Time Allotment:** 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM (may go longer). Everything will be recorded for those who can't stay for the entire duration. If you are at work sneaking in here to listen in, shame on you (but I am not encouraging that).

## **Content Coverage: Forex, Index Futures, and the ICT Teaching Approach**

Today's session will cover:

*   Forex
*   Index Futures

**The ICT teaching philosophy:** My approach is to tell you what will happen *before* it happens. Explain what price is going to do. Then, wait for price to do it. Afterward, I can teach more amplified approaches to what I have already taught you conceptually on this YouTube channel or in my mentorship.

## **New to ICT? Where to Begin (The First 10 Minutes)**

This section is especially for the brand new viewers. If you're seasoned, you can skip the next 10 minutes.

**Purpose:** Guide newcomers on where to start and address the feeling of information overload. This content will also be referenced in my first book.

**Why a book and YouTube?:** There will be a lot of things placed in this channel throughout the duration of 2023 that will help amplify the things I'm going to teach in the book because obviously books and charts that are static, they're not as dynamic and as good as a teaching tool whereas you'll hear and see me doing here.

I tell you *exactly* what's going to happen *beforehand*, then we see how the setups form.

**Student Task:** Borrow my experience. When I share my opinion on where price will go (in live streams, Twitter, etc.), your job is to learn from that, not just blindly copy trades. It's *not* a signal service.

**Where to Begin (if new):**

1.  Go to the **2022 Mentorship playlist** on this YouTube channel.
    *   41 videos are available.
    *   You can ignore the first video (if you're in a rush), but don't skip anything else.
    *   Many people watch the first few and think they understand; you likely don't.
    *   I will be referencing the 2022 model and silver bullets today.

I have two pages of topics we're covering today, depending on how much energy I have.

**Practical Steps:** Start looking for setups and *practice observing*, not trading. Don't try to trade with real money right away.

## **Mindset and Expectations: Slow Down, Learn, and Avoid Impulsivity**

It's important to slow down your impulsiveness to want to make money. It's exciting seeing the things I'm sharing and my students sharing and all these people that are claiming that they found success with my stuff, and that's wonderful. I'm honored. I'm in such a position of privilege to be considered your mentor and having so many people around the world being profitable now, but it's not a rush to get to that point.

**Acknowledging Failures:** I have had failed students. Not *everyone* succeeds. Some simply can't do it or can't do it *yet*, and eventually, they get there.

**Time and Effort:** How much time and effort you put into this will determine how long it takes you to find your setup.

## **Determining Your Path: Focus and Application**

This workshop is focused on:

*   Where you should be in your learning pursuit.
*   What you should be focusing on.
*   How to determine your path through the content.

I teach *many* ways to trade:

*   Different timeframes
*   Different setups
*   Different entry mechanisms
*   Different ways to take profits (partials, etc.)

Today is a "nuts and bolts, kitchen sink" approach to ICT. This session will help you:

*   Determine your best area of study.
*   Highlight areas where you're currently lacking.
*   Help you to focus your personal interest.

**Where are you NOW?:** You might be hit-or-miss, making some profits in demo but then losing them. That's actually a *good* position to be in. It's a wonderful position to be in because if you're in there impulsively just pushing the button you're probably blowing your account.

You may have no model or frame of reference to anticipate price movement. We're going to remove that today, giving you a framework to study and measure progress.

## **The Importance of Active Learning and Backtesting**

**A Critical Point:** If you *only* watch my videos and don't go into your own charts (demo or real-time, but primarily historical), you won't learn effectively.

I'm going to show you *exactly* what you're supposed to be doing.

**Why backtesting?** It's based on studying something as a case study that's happened in the past. How else can you determine you know a foundations or something? You have to have a good foundation in observing repeating phenomenon at specific times of the day with repeating characteristics.

**ICT Mentorship Focus:** I teach you how to observe and find these Hallmark signatures in price action.

**Disclaimer:** I can't *promise* profitability. It's based on your time, effort, and organization.

## **The ICT Mindset: Avoiding Laziness and Entitlement**

**Key Traits for Success (or Failure):**

*   If you are lazy, you will fail.
*   If you have an entitlement mindset (expecting me to do everything for you, needing one-on-one teaching), I can't help you effectively.

I *will* call moves and outline things. Watch my live streams; I call every smallest timeframe Candlestick one at a time where it's going to go and how it's going to behave. There is no better performance measurement than that. If there is no way of doing that real time, then there is no need for you to ask for statements and give me a live trade and trade live in front of me, because I've already done that.

I have a live account with TD Ameritrade where you can actually see statements where I logged in showed every single day win loss exercise of drawdown came out of drawdown just to teach students.

There's nothing to be afraid of. There's no fear of losing; you should *respect* risk.

**Losses are Inevitable:** Everyone who trades *will* incur losses. Accept it. How you handle your perception about your ability to work through that and stick to the model that you have trusted is what matters.

100% Strike Rate is unrealistic. You don't need a high success rate to be profitable.

**Realistic Goals:**

*   I'm not promising you'll get rich or make millions.
*   The money management principles I teach, when factored together, can potentially lead to wealth.
*   You *can* quit your job, have a side income, or win competitions.

**Focus on Learning, Not Fame:** If you're here to be a social media star, it's the wrong approach. Avoid impulsivity and focus on not losing money and learning consistent profitability.

## **The Pitfalls of Over-Trading and Chasing Losses**

*   Consistent profitability doesn't equate to everyday trading.
*   Day trading *every day* (especially in the first two years) will lead to more losses.

**The Importance of Lectures:** The "dry" parts of my discussions are *critical*. You'll come back to them after you've tried things, had some success, and then experienced losses.

**The Danger of Chasing Break-Even:** You have a losing trade and want to fix it, chasing break-even and making the drawdown larger.

Avoid those periods. It doesn't mean everything is broken, but you can derail your learning if you trade live before you're ready.

## **Experience-Based Teaching and Personal Responsibility**

I give you 30 years of experience. I've been through the losses, blown accounts – it was all my fault.

Be responsible for your own actions.

**Disclaimer:**

*   If you make money using my teachings, well done. I'm not responsible.
*   If you lose money, you did that. Own it.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   I can tell you what's going to happen in the market with precision, and *you* can learn that precision.
*   You can grow into having a clean understanding about price, what to anticipate, and, more importantly, *when not to try to trade.*
*   *Knowing when NOT to trade* is an important, often overlooked lesson.
*   These boring conversations are critical, especially after drawdowns.

I want you to do well, but you must follow rules and give yourself time to grow.

## **Workshop Structure and Next Steps**

With that mindset, let's begin!

**Next Steps (After This Presentation):**

*   After this presentation, over the weekend, you know I don't know how much time you have to devote to this today or the next couple days, but I did a live stream on the 13th of June and I talked about some of the things we'll talk about in the first hour of the presentation here.
*   I'll do one hour and then I'll break for like 5-10 minutes.
*   I'll leave the recording going, so that way if you have to tend to something, relieve yourself, or whatever. I'm going to want to stretch out as well, and then I'll come back.
*   We'll do that like every hour, like a 10, 5, 10-minute break, but the recording will still keep going for those that are.

That should be a much better presentation and retain the information in a much easier to understand format.


Okay, here's the organized and refined version of the provided text. I've aimed to retain every detail, nuance, and the original tone while structuring it for better readability and comprehension.

# **ICT Workshop: Continued Analysis and Market Insights**

## **Housekeeping and Community Support**

It would be **really helpful in their own recording and documentation** where I talk about certain things, and I have very studious students that like to do this.
*   If you would **help me create a little timeline** for if I transition from one topic to the next, or if I go from one market to the next.
*   If you want to **send me those minute markers on Twitter**, that would be wonderful.
*   I'll use those in the comment section of the video so that way it helps people go right to those moments.
*   I am **not going to go through this and do that myself**, but I know I have a lot of students that do that for their own purposes in my other videos. So just let you know I'll appreciate that help.
*   On the **13th, I covered my opinion** about what I thought was going to happen this week.

## **The Evolution of ICT's Teaching Approach**

When I was doing one-on-one mentorships back in the mid-90s:

*   Folks would learn about me by me advertising.
*   It was a high-end advertisement.
*   It was people that had a lot of money and wanted to come to me and learn how to do something with that money on their own.
*   They had either already been in the marketplace or were looking to do something to get into it.

One of the greater selling points I had was:

*   I would tell them much like I did on the 13th of June 2023.
*   It's on my YouTube; it was live-streamed.
*   It wasn't a pre-recorded thing.
*   Everybody blocked me out on it, and we talked about the CPI number.
*   I walked you through CPI real time.
*   I walked you through a 15-second Candlestick chart.

**15-Second Candlestick Chart Details:**

*   Every single Candlestick represented a fluctuation of the highest high, the lowest low, and the open and close of every 15-second increment.
*   You don't see that in books.
*   You don't see anybody teaching with that type of time frame.
*   Everything that I teach is fractal because it's the same price whether you're looking at it from a weekly chart, monthly chart, three-quarter, sorry, three-month chart, a yearly chart, it doesn't matter; price is price.

## **Understanding Price Delivery Continuum**

What I'm going to teach you today is a **secret of breaking down price and looking for that price delivery continuum**.

*   How to go in like if you ever watch me do a presentation where I'm recording my trades.
*   If the comment sections are open, or if I share it on Twitter, most of the time you'll see a handful of folks come in and say why did you pick that time frame, and why didn't you trade this time frame, why didn't you trade that time frame?
*   I'm going to answer that for you today, and that way you'll know what time frame you're going to be looking at.

## **Tailoring Learning to Experience Level**

*   Some of the lessons today won't be so impactful for you because of where you are in your learning.
*   If you're brand new, a lot of this stuff is going to go right over your head.
*   If you stick with this and you study it, I promise three months from now if you come back to this presentation and you watch it, you're going to swear that I added something new, but it's just because your focus is on things that aren't important to you at the time that I believe I believe are more Paramount.
*   The most important thing is understanding where price is going to go.

The selling point I gave to my students that would come with me one-on-one:

*   They would spend a whole entire week with me, Monday through Friday.
*   We would be at the charts live when the market opened up.
*   I would show them bonds in S&P; that's it.
*   That's all we'll talk about.
*   I would give them the previous week.
*   I would say, okay, here's what it's going to do. This is where it's going to go to, and we'll cover it next week.
*   Think about that and treat it like what I gave you on the 13th of this week.

In a live stream, I talked about very specific points of reference in price for:

*   The dollar
*   Euro dollar
*   Pound dollar
*   Gold
*   NASDAQ
*   ES and DOW futures

## **Review and Application of Market Insights**

I'm going to go through those individually, and kind of like it'll be somewhat of a review, but I'm going to teach also the main takeaways and what you're supposed to do with this information. Because it's not like I saw it's unfortunate I get new people all the time on Twitter, and because they don't know me, they don't know my personality, don't know how to teach. When I show examples, we'll cover the reasons why I took the NASDAQ trade in detail also for those that are asking from yesterday's Trading post fomc.

## **ICT's MythBusters Edition: Demystifying Market Events**

*   I'm going to teach you how to trade CPI today.
*   I'm going to teach you how to trade fomc.
*   I'm going to teach you how to trade non-farm payroll Friday.
*   It's **MythBusters ICT Edition** today, too.
*   We're removing all the talking points that people like to use that attract you from trying to study with me.
*   I teach you to avoid trying to trade ahead of CPI.
*   I teach you try to try to teach you to stay away from trying to trade ahead of fomc and ahead of non-prone payroll.
*   I have done many examples of me Trading Post fomc, Post CPI, post non-farm payroll.
*   I've done years of that.
*   My students that were with me every single day in private mentorship for years saw me explain where I think it was going to go and watch it happen.

It's not that I'm trying to prevent you or teach you that no one can make money on those days.

*   It's because I'm assuming when you're watching, you aren't a new, I'm sorry, you're a new Trader that your experience is very small.
*   You don't know what you're doing, so I'm trying to protect you from yourself because I was my worst enemy, and you're you're worth anything right now.
*   You don't realize it, but you are.
*   If you listen to me, I'm talk I'm trying my best to try to give you everything in the perfect proper order, how you're going to develop because I've done this for a long time, and I already know what the questions you're going to ask me.
*   Many of the questions you're going to ask are that's coming up in normal development is already in the videos.
*   It's on my YouTube video channel.
*   It's it's it's layered across lots of time because this can't be learned real quick because you're going to discover what you think you're going into this to try to do because a lot of you think you want to trade the Silver Bullet.
*   A lot of you came in think you're going to trade optimal trade entry, but you discovered the 2022 model, and that that makes sense to you.
*   Right now, your initial expectations you're probably going to lose that maybe in this discussion today, and you may develop a better focus on what it is that you want to do, and that's that's a success for me and you if that if you arrive at Ted today, that's a success, that's a good use of your time today.

## **Effective Note-Taking for Enhanced Learning**

*   I promise you if you take good notes, not just simply watch me, take good notes.
*   Here's what I want you to do while you're listening to me today.
*   Don't try to write down every single point that I'm trying to cover.
*   When I'm talking about fomc and how to trade that, or trading CPI, or if I'm talking about silver bullets fair value gaps, or whatever that topic is, write that topic or Focus point and where I am in the minute marker or hour marker on the playback.
*   All you gotta do is hover over top of the the little time thing at the bottom of this video, and it'll tell you where you are when I'm talking about it, and it makes it easier for you to go back in and dig into that that's good note-taking because then you can go back and go in and get the real nitty-gritty to it, and I'm going to talk a lot about it in detail, so it's important you do that, otherwise watching it alone is not going to be enough.
*   I know get to the point get I hear you all right.

## **Dollar Index Analysis: Weekly Chart**

Let's go over to the **dollar Index**.
*   This is a **weekly chart**, and I shared all this business on the 13th.
*   I added this a little area in here. This is a **fair value Gap**, and I have to be careful when I'm talking because I noticed in the 13th live stream when I was referring to certain things, my cursor wasn't really where I wanted to be when I was making points.
*   I'm trying to make a conscious um note of making sure I have my cursor where I want to talk about it.

So where I have my cursor near that candle is high, and the specific close is what I'm looking at for that range to that candle's low. The candle to the left of this one, this one here, that body of that candle that is encapsulated between the range of this this candle is low here, that makes the high of the fair value, yeah.

*   This candle's high or closed, and I just dropped it there it's so close it doesn't make a difference that candle's High and or closing point represents the low of the fair value go.
*   The Shaded area is highlighting this particular candle's body, not the entire body of the candle, just the reins that's being shaded here.
*   Between those two reference points, that is considered by my definition if I call it a fair value Gap, its classification is a buy side imbalanced sell side inefficiency, meaning that the delivery of price was on the upside.

## **Paint Roller Analogy: Understanding Market Inefficiencies**

Think about a paint roller:

*   I've used this analogy before.
*   If you want to paint a wall in your home, and you'll you apply the paint to the roller, and you apply that roller to the wall.
*   You're getting that delivery up if you keep doing that from the bottom of the wall to the top, eventually paint will run out, and you'll see these little pockets these little little pits on the wall where paint didn't make its way to the wall.
*   You already know what do you have to do you got to roll back down over top of that to fill in those little pockets and gaps where paint was not distributed.

Think about price the same way.

*   Between these two reference points, that being this candle's High and this candle is low, that one candle right here in that shaded area that's purple, there's going to be small inefficiencies in that range that's shaded in purple.
*   The easiest way to to simplify it is we don't need to know yet where those small little pockets are on the lower time frame because this is a weekly candlestick, so inside that range that range I'm highlighting here with my cursor.
*   Somewhere along the line in that very weak of data, there are gaps inefficiencies we don't need to know exactly where they are, but we can identify that range right here as soon as this as soon as that candle closes and we begin a new week that Gap that's shaded in purple we know that there's a likelihood that the market will want to at some future time want to reprice to that that is not balanced.
*   All it means is that shaded area that's purple it's buy side imbalance, so the Market's shown an imbalance meaning it wants to go up it did go up, so what is it inefficient is inefficient in the sense that it hasn't had a sell side delivery.
*   Sell side is when price is being offered downward an down down close candle.

My down closed candles are are black, my up close candles or bullish candles are green for that purple shaded area here for that to be repriced to and offset the inefficiency of sell side because it's by side imbalance it's imbalanced it has to be balanced later on, and I'll tell you how it becomes balanced, but right now it what is it lacking it's lacking sell side delivery.

*   That means a candle must trade down in between the high and low of that purple range, and it's defined by the two candles I mentioned here this candle's High that candle's low.
*   So in our mind and my mind as an analyst, I'm looking at this and thinking okay well we've seen a lot of back and forth price action all through here let me add a rectangle here highlight because I knew I may or may not have my cursor exactly where I want it as I'm talking because the live stream okay.
*   So inside that darker shaded pink area inside that rectangle notice how there was a lot of back and forth up and down price delivery you see how it's created like a small little trading range in there where is there a break in all that back and forth movement it's in that shaded purple area here so up and down back and forth.

Think about that pain analogy. All inside this pink area if price was paint in the canvas that is the background of my chart is the wall in that shaded area price has done a very good job of moving back and forth inside that pink shaded area, but it didn't do a very good job of efficiently offering sell side delivery in that little area right there.

*   So what the algorithm does it seeks those areas there because it's easily defined by arrays old highs and lows that are separated across the spectrum of three 24-hour periods any separation between this time frame or any other time frame.

I'm going to teach you the price delivery Continuum today, so you can see from one time frame down to the smaller time frame how did you pick that fair value Gap and not this sphere Vega you're going to know all that today okay but you won't retain it unless you're paying attention and probably watch this video a few times.

*   So we know that there is a strong tendency for the market to want to come back and re-price into these areas.
*   Now let's take us into what I was mentioning on the 13th for those that you want to go back and revisit you've already watched the 13th video.
*   I think it's a little less than two hours long for the people that want to get right to the point I'm going to help you here okay you should watch the entire video and some wonderful information, but for those that want to just simply go right to the points for the dollar Index on the June 13 2023 price action lecture in market review.

## **Dollar Index: June 13th Recap and 102.705 Price Level**

*   I was teaching on CPI, the uh minute marker four minutes you'll hear me talk about a price level of **102.705.**
*   I want you to think about what I just covered here on the weekly chart okay I'm going to keep this just as it is here and drop down to a daily chart.
*   So when I'm looking at price, I have all of this higher time frame weekly perspective in mind so if I were asked which time frame do I spend the most time on it's the weekly chart.

## **Why ICT Focuses on the Weekly Chart**

Now why do I spend the most time on the weekly chart number one as I taught my students one-on-one in the mid 90s and the way I teach my students in mentorship and the way I've taught and shared in those mentorship lectures on my YouTube don't buy people pirating my stuff and trying to sell it to you it's been made available to you on this YouTube channel for free go and study it at your leisure go your own pace there's no rush I'm not taking the videos down in November they're staying up that premise of how I go into the marketplace and what I'm looking for on the weekend usually either on a late Friday evening once my whole family goes to bed and they've turned down for the night I don't sleep like a normal person so I do a lot of study really really late night or early in the morning before they wake up or if I don't get that I do it on a Saturday I look at the weekly chart in reference to a monthly chart a three month chart a yearly chart and I'm looking at it the same way I'm doing here okay and I'm trying not to steal too much Thunder from future lessons but just know that what I'm doing here I've done that with a monthly chart I do it with a three month chart and on trading view it's really nice because if you go in you type 1 m takes you into a monthly charges like that and right away you can see things that you may not have noticed before.

So you have a one month chart here and right away my long-term students can see right away they're thinking wow that thing used the volume imbalance right there the separation between this body's clothes and this body's open that monthly candle went right up into it there and then


Okay, here's the organized and refined version of the provided text. I've aimed to retain every detail, nuance, and the original tone while structuring it for better readability and comprehension.

# **ICT Workshop: Continued Analysis and Market Insights (Cont.)**

## **Monthly Chart Analysis and Market Predictions**

...went lower all month. So, I'm looking at those types of relationships, and you can look at **3M**; it'll give you three months of data. You can see how we're drawing down into this by side of balance outside efficiency, which is the same thing I just highlighted in purple on the weekly chart. That's this here; it's the same thing. So, in my mind, I like to look for those first, and if there is no inefficiency, then I'm looking for liquidity.

In summary, let me rephrase everything I just said:

*   When I sit down on the weekends, whatever time I'm going to be doing my analysis, the market is **not** Trading.
*   All of my analysis is done when the market is **not** Trading.
*   What I'm trying to **predict** to anticipate, **not react to**, is where is the present weekly candle reaching for higher or lower prices.
*   If I see an inefficiency like this right here, that purple shaded area, I'm expecting price to try to draw down into that.
*   If this inefficiency wasn't there, I would look for that low because that's where sell side would reside or consequent encouragement, which is the midpoint of this candle's tail.

So, it'll be this, let me make sure I have my cursor sitting here for a second before I started saying anything more:

*   I would either look for that midpoint of that candles tail, which is **consequent encroachment**, or I would use the low of that Wick there.
*   If folks listen, if there was no inefficiency that's shaped in purple, if that wasn't there, I would be expecting price to draw down.
*   Now, why would I expect that? What makes me say that? Because we already hit our targets that I covered in the previous weeks.
*   For those that weren't here, I was talking about how the dollar was going to go higher that we were going to use this shaded area here as an inversion, fair value gap and treat it as something bullish.
*   They're trade up into the weekly order block, which is this opening price of this candle here.
*   This candle's opening price, that's the weekly bear shorter block.

It was acting as a Target then I said the mean threshold of that candle, which is the middle point of its body in here, that's the bare shorter block mean threshold that was also a Target.

*   So once it hit that, we want to see what's going to happen once the target's met, whether for the week or a day.
*   You have to get comfortable grow real comfortable with just simply sitting still and waiting move very very slowly when you're trying to make money.

## **The Importance of Slow and Deliberate Trading**

And I learned this lesson from **Larry Williams**. It didn't make any sense when I first learned it or heard him say it, and it took dozens of times of blowing out accounts not listening to advice move slow when you're trying to make money move fast when you're trying to preserve it or protect it.

*   If you watch something paying out that you have done analysis on and you've been successful with it, don't be in a rush to get another dopamine hit because that feels good that's a neophyte that's a brand new Traders trap.
*   You see many times individuals that are open about what they've done wrong, and they use social media like a confessional father.
*   I've sinned look what I did and I blew my account okay you don't need to do that don't do that once you see something pan out meditate on that.

Let there be a period of time between where you've seen something pan out you were successful, and then really record how that felt for you because in the future you're going to have periods where you do something wrong and it may be a week long of that a series of doing things incorrectly.

*   If you don't journal the times that you've done it right, not just when you've done it wrong, but when you do it right, and you encourage yourself, you remind yourself that you follow the rules, the market panned out like you were hoping it would, and you anticipated that you're conditioning your subconscious to hold on to that as a positive experience.

But when you're journaling, you're not recording your negative results in a manner that is condemning.

*   Don't use language or terms like oh I was stupid or this stuff is never going to work for me never ever ever in your Journal ever record anything negative.
*   You can still highlight the fact that you did something incorrect, but how you describe it, how you encapsulate that in your Journal, your subconscious is going to remember that.
*   If you write down that you were an idiot in that trade, I should have did this, I knew better but I did this or that you're actually creating scar tissue, and there's no elasticity there's no elasticity in Scar Tissue you you can't grow without a whole lot of tearing and pain.

So, to remove that growth of Scar Tissue on your subconscious and the psyche that's required to to do this as an industry, you have to make sure that you're conscious of what you're doing and you're guarding your mind.

## **The Dangers of Social Media and the Importance of Positive Journaling**

**Social media** is a a very big factor in why people are not successful.

*   So, you think social media is going to encourage you, and it might initially, but what you'll find is it's very toxic, and you don't want to bring that toxicity into your Journal.
*   If you put it in your journal, what you're doing is you're making a ledger of every single time that you have an engagement with your expectations, your model, and price, and what price does ultimately is outside your control.
*   But how you perceive what you are expecting and how you record that that is Paramount in how you will walk forward by recording your negative experiences in a light that is devoid of any kind of judgment, no kind of condemnation, new kind of ridicule or criticism that is Harsh.

What you want to do is record in your Journal if you've done something wrong say:

*   I'm happy that I can see that this is where I can improve on this is my area of study that I need to work on versus I got stopped out here.
*   I didn't listen to what the Mark was telling me, and I kept trading against it and I you know went into serious drawdown or I would have blew my account there.

All that stuff that you're putting in your Journal, their memories, but they're happening in a level that's way deeper than just short-term memory you're you're charging it with emotion and energy that you will tap into subconsciously.

*   The effect happens when you like when you're a child, and you saw a scary movie do you think every time the lights go off that event that what scared you in the movie you think that's what's under your bed it's in your closet okay your conditioning is called priming.
*   So, when you're journaling, you're priming yourself for future success it's brainwashing yourself it's really what it is you are tricking your brain to only see the Silver Lining which is critical it's critical because it's easy to talk yourself out of this because it's highly technical and nobody's going to cheerlead you nobody's going to coddle you you have to be able to find your own cheerleader inside you to keep yourself going because in the beginning stages of this stuff it's very very challenging because you don't know where you're going to go as a Trader.

And we're going to cover more about where you should go and how to determine that for yourself, but you take all this information from a higher time frame. I do this and I look at where price is likely to go.

## **Understanding Price Delivery Continuum**

It's only going to go up for one of two reasons okay price delivery price delivery continuum is the movement from where price is right now to Future delivery.

*   So, where it's going to be five minutes from now, a week from now, two days from now, two sessions from now it's going up to take out buy stops or it's going up the trade into some kind of inefficiency like a fair value guy that is it that's the only two reasons why price goes up period.
*   It's not buying pressure I'm sorry but that's the truth it does not go up because of buying pressure it doesn't matter how many people buy it perfect excuses if you look at price and study volume okay 30 volume how many contracts does it take for a limit up move in wheat not that you probably trade weed you only need one contract rated it opens up at the limit up move boom who can trade there nobody it's locked limit what was the what was the volume whatever that trade was that marked it that wasn't buying pressure that wasn't buying pressure it was only one transaction it opened it up here boom nobody else can buy it that's not buying pressure right.

So that's that was the biggest wake-up call to me when I was a commodity Trader in a million years that's how I started by the way.

*   I realize that volume is important yes it does have a a place in analysis but too much emphasis is placed on that as a reason why price goes up or down and it's not price goes up to seek liquidity and if it's going up what liquidity is that buy side liquidity buy stops okay.
*   If it doesn't run for liquidity on that particular time frame it's going up for an inefficiency that means a gap a gap would be like that purple shaded area here or this I don't know what that color would be called we'll call it the a pale orange that gap between this candle is low that candles low over here and this candle is high that's what's being shown here in that little pale orange shaded area that's noted as the weekly inversion fair that you got that Gap and this purple one here they are called inefficiencies.

## **Analyzing Market Efficiency and Liquidity**

Think about the pain analogy I gave you when price is moving back and forth in a defined range what's the Divine range here where your eye looks at Price just like I have it shaded here in pink price has moved rather efficiently inside that pink area up and down okay when price entered the low end of this pink shaded area now we don't know that pink shaded area is the range yet what I'm saying is when I'm looking at Price I'm looking at how price was delivered during a period of time in whatever time frame I'm looking at.

*   So, this is applicable to whatever time frame you're looking at whether it be a weekly chart, a daily chart, four hour chart, six hour chart, 15 minute chart, second chart it doesn't matter okay.
*   It does not matter what matters is where are the inefficiencies and where are the stops above old highs is buy side or by stops below old lows is sell stocks or sell side liquidity those are the two things I'm looking for after my eye goes through the chart and I'm looking for the inefficiency.

So, the first thing I'm looking for is inefficiencies that's the first thing I'm looking for because that's the that's the array that the algorithm reaches for first it pans for any inefficiency.

*   If there if there's no inefficiency and we're in a premium and we're likely to go lower then it's going to be looking for sell sign reverse that if we are in a range and we're in a discount and there is no inefficiency above price but there's a short-term High it's going to run for the buy side thank you that's what I'm doing on the weekly chart.

So, for the folks that are hammering themselves and beating themselves up please teach bias I just did I just did but what you're wrestling with is you don't have time looking at charts like I'm showing you here.

*   You see this pink shaded area how the market entered it went up to this candle's High the next week we opened up here then we traded higher up to this point here then the next candle or next week we open we trade down and overlap all the way and into the previous high.
*   So, there's no fair value Gap formation whatsoever in the candle I'm highlighting right now notice that the candle to the left of it's high and the candle to the right of its low there is no separation like you see in that purple shaded range that's a fair value Gap there is no fair value gap between the candle I'm highlighting here with my cursor using the candle to the left and the candle to the right.

So what is actually happening there the price has gone up and down up and down that's like that wall being painted very efficiently is there any inefficiency there no so at that time when we start on this week we open we rally up make the high and then we close after making a low here.

*   So, there's been a lot of delivery up and down in between the Range High of this week and the close of this candle here.
*   Now why am I picking that close it's because I'm showing you how prices reacted in here and why I was telling you on the 13th in a live stream that can't be Cherry Picked it was told to everybody watching it that I want to see dollar reach lower okay and we haven't even got off the weekly chart yet I'm teaching what I'm looking at and this is what I'm trying to tell you I spend the majority of my time on the weekly chart I'm looking at how price delivered think about what I'm showing you here and how that relates to this area right over here think about that right in here that same idea we can apply it to over here I promise you I'm taking you somewhere even though if you think you don't know what you're understanding and confusion is probably peaking right now just keep staying with it I promise it'll make sense as I'm going same thing here price opens up trades higher back and forth delivery all up to the high back and forth and then we leave it.

## **Identifying Inefficiencies and Applying Market Analysis**

So, before this broke down is there any efficiency over here below this pink shade there is there any inefficiency?

*   Inefficiency would be like this this candle here how has that separation between the candles High to the left of it and the candles low to the right of it does that occur or form anywhere underneath this pain shaded area in all this do you see that yes right here I'm just going to use a short little trend line.
*   I promise you folks this is the stuff you're looking for even though you may not feel like it's important right now or it doesn't make any sense take you light years ahead moves to everybody else out there today so there's a gap there so I would take like this rectangle here I would highlight this but I'm only showing it as a small little section with the rectangle not being here but just simply using the trend line sections.

So, we have an inefficiency here.

*   So, when the market leaves this range it's in a premium relative to the low and where it traded to it's in this range consolidate and then it leaves it where's it going to go well there's several things you can use the consequent encroachment of this Wick midpoint of that then you have the gap here that this traded down into but left the majority of the Gap still untouched right.
*   So, when it drops here price is going to want to trade into this area here does it do so yes and again that would be bias that would be bias for that particular week for the dollar what do you think that would mean for you Forex traders that want to trade pound dollar what would you anticipate that week this week I'm highlighting right here how would you use that information you would go into your charts and back test any long positions during the London open between two o'clock and five o'clock in the morning New York local time.
*   You would look at your am session Kill Zone the New York Killzone between seven o'clock in the morning and nine o'clock in New York local time you would look for the model of 20202 you would look for optimal trade entries you could look for silver bullets because silver bullets form in the kill zones between seven o'clock and nine o'clock what'd I say yep we're teaching that again today too it's not limited to just index Futures and 10 o'clock to 11 or 2 o'clock to three o'clock in the afternoon for index Futures.
*   If you're a Forex Trader everything that I teach is applicable even though you see me predominantly teaching it in e-mini s p and Futures contracts it's applicable to Forex you just there's subtle little rules that you have to worry about in time is the the factor that's got to be considered because yes there are silver bullets between 10 o'clock and one o'clock in Forex yes but they are really good ones between the seven o'clock and nine o'clock in



Okay, here's the organized and refined version of the provided text. I've aimed to retain every detail, nuance, and the original tone while structuring it for better readability and comprehension.

# **ICT Workshop: Continued Analysis and Market Insights (Cont.)**

## **Analyzing Kill Zones and Market Ranges**

New York Brooklyn Killzone in between three o'clock and five o'clock long open Killzone they're there every day every single day you have a reason for you to find a setup.

*   Now again that is not an invitation for you to go in and try to trade every single day.
*   Think about how the market moves in these ranges.

This is a balanced price range. Why is that a balanced price range?

*   Because the market has moved up and down within it and then it left the range.
*   So, it's going to leave the range.

What is the algorithm that's make an argument for a sake of folks that don't want to believe there's an algorithm that controls price?

*   There's no amount of buying and selling pressure that's going to change that.
*   Market's going to go where the Market's going to go.
*   It's predetermined your daily high and low is predetermined whether you like it or not it is what it is okay.

How can we determine where that likely higher low is going to form or where would it likely reach to start on these higher time frames and charts and if we know that we can see prices likely to want to expand lower think about because we're on what chart what time frame up here weekly.

*   So, my analysis everything I'm doing on the weekend when the markets are not Trading.
*   I'm trying to determine what's the strongest directional bias that can be derived by looking at the weekly chart.
*   What is it likely to be reaching for on a weekly Candlestick chart it's going to either be reaching up for buy stops or it's going to be reaching up for a fair value Gap above where the market is right now.
*   If it's likely to go lower then I believe it's going down to a fair value Gap below current market price or it's going to go down to reach for sell side liquidity below some old low that is not complicated folks these things on your chart they're not hiding from you they've been in plain sight you just never been told to look at it this way because you're trying to apply indicators and all these things and frankly you know when you look at like this you should be able to see it really quick.

You're seeing when I'm looking at the chart like this:

*   My eye jumps real quick to inefficiencies my eye jumps to that my eye jump to that that I'm probably moving faster in the live stream can keep up and then obviously the Gap that I just showed in every High every weekly Candlestick high and low is a factor as well they're going to be used again they don't just get used one time and they expire Okay so I teach there's a 60-day look back and the highest form of precision or highest form of accuracy in terms of my key levels I Define it with within that 60-day range and it's 60 Market Days not 60 calendar days obviously but it's looking back 60 days so what I'm looking for is the highest high and the lowest low in the last 60 days.
*   I'm looking for inefficiencies in the last 60 days whether it be premium or discount that means a fair value Gap like that per one here was before we traded down here in the beginning of the week the dollar Index was up here and on the 13th I explained it I felt like we would draw them.
*   I'm teaching the part that was not made available to you on the 13th live stream okay so I'm I'm filling in that gap of insight that wasn't made available in that presentation but this is the logic that went behind it so let me take this off and we'll drop down finally into a daily chart okay.

## **Daily Chart Analysis and Inversion Fair Value Gaps**

Here's the daily chart and let me take all this business off because they're all distractions and I want you to focus only on the things I'm making a point about all right so this inversion fair value Gap was an old Gap notice that it does not look like a gap on the daily chart where it did look like it on a weekly let me just for completeness sake drop back up to a weekly chart that separation from this candle is low and that candle is high the candle to the left of that it's only sell side delivery it's a sell side imbalance buy side inefficiency **(SIBI)** it's a fair value Gap but the classification is a city meaning that some future time the market is going to trade up and deliver price on the upside so it's offering buy side delivery we see that happen here on this candle but I said that we would treat that as a inversion fair value Gap go back and look at all the presentations and commentary around at the time but then on the 13th of this week June 13 2023 I said that we would look for this old Gap okay this is What Separates Me from folks like **Chris Laurie** where they look at inefficiency and then he'll tell you it's done that's his terms it's not meant to be disrespectful but when I tell people you can learn how to read price action with Chris Laura if you don't like me that's that's fine but you won't learn what I'm teaching from Chris Laurie that you can learn how to see inefficiency in the price I didn't learn inefficiency from uh from **Chris Laurie** okay I was trading before **Chris Laurie** but long story short this whole business of inefficiencies we can use them as real Dynamic support and resistance because that's in fact really how the algorithm refers back to them.

Meaning this:

*   When I look at this range this shaded area it doesn't look like a fair value gap on the daily chart whereas that is a fair value Gap you see that right there look look where I have my cursor at right here on this candle here go up that candle I'm laying my cursor on top of to the left of it that candle is low here and the next camel to the right of this one that came as high that is a fair Vega it is a civi so it's not a balanced by sound efficiency notice that that is not what you see inside of the Shaded area here that was the weekly inversion for your radica so the price delivery Continuum is when you have these higher time frame inefficiencies regardless of whatever time frame it is when you drop down to a lower time frame you cannot ignore or forget the impact that those higher time frame inefficiencies will have on the lower time frame the lower time frames you can use for precision like refining risk and and making it much smaller so larger positions can be assumed that's not to say that you should take on larger risk but this is safer the sake of argument that you want to use a one percent risk model that means whatever your Equity is in your account times that by one percent whatever that amount is you can look at a range from where you think you're going to get in at the entry point and where you want to Define your stop loss and whatever that amount is you divide that by the one percent equity that you define as your maximum risk you want to incur having that the math will tell you how many contracts or lots that you can trade and still be within that one percent using lower time frame charts helps you define that risk rather small I mean you watched me to do it this week where I was using less than one handle on index features you cannot do that consistently in Forex promise you I promise you you cannot do that consistently in Forex the reason why is because Forex Brokers many times you're trading inside their specific pool of liquidity and they have the benefit of being able to open the spread on you when you're trading index Futures you're seeing the same price everybody sees everybody's high is the same everybody's low is the same that's why it's a gentleman's Market in reference to the ladies that's not as snub against you it's just a more refined professional Market it doesn't mean that you can't trade Forex and use small stop losses but don't don't fall into the traffic you got to do these Ultra less than two pip two pit one pip stop losses because I'm telling you if I ran a brokerage firm and I was a Forex brokerage firm I would open the spread all the time on all of you and I'm I'm teaching you so wouldn't they want to do it to you of course they're going to do it to you especially if you're if you're trying to trade size and you get frustrated and when everybody was trading Forex you know in the early 2000s um there was bucket shops all the time and I got burned by several of them and **fxcm** was one of them okay and it's just they did it they they did things that were not good and it's better now obviously but I don't ever talk about workers so I know some of you are hoping that I'm going to talk about Book Broker would you recommend I don't do that I'm not an introducing broker it's for you to determine that okay so I'm not in an affiliation with anybody no brokerage firm new funding accounts nothing and that's the reason why I'm Point Blank and sometimes not always the best person to talk about your company because if I don't like it I'm going to tell you but I'm not going to sugarcoat something and say here I have an affiliation with this company I like them no whatever I tell you is the truth if it's good I'll tell you if it's bad it's it is but I'm not trying to tell you to go with any broker they all suck and they're all great it depends on what your personal experience is so there you go there's my opinion but these inefficiencies these gaps from the higher time frame you have to have them annotated on your chart now in the future you'll probably graduate to a point where I haven't just on a piece of paper like I have a pad I have a small little yellow pad that I work with all the time and whatever Market I'm following I have those levels noted what levels am I talking about the highest high and the lowest low in the midpoint of every inefficiency on a higher time frame for that particular market so we're looking at the dollar Index so it obviously is taking me more time to tell you what you're doing with this chart and what you're supposed to focus on and what you're supposed to utilize but once you understand it's like riding a bike you'll go through the motions and it won't take this long to go through it but the majority of the time your analysis will be done on the higher time frame weekly chart you'll be doing these things looking at where is it likely to gravitate to now rewind back to the 13th of June 2023 earlier in the week in the live stream I talked about how I felt that this shaded area here the weekly inversion for everybody got would then now act as an inversion fair value gap for the downside in other words it would act as resistance we would want to see signatures in price showing a willingness to put a dollar Index to go up to it treat it like a ceiling reject it and send it lower now I am not a support resistance Trader I know I supply and demand Trader okay even though that that shaded area May quickly look like if you're someone that's traded with the same side and Online Trading Academy and all that stuff I get accused of using Supply demand all the time it's not that okay I use very very specific levels and they would never consider that Gap back their nuclear chart ever again and they wouldn't considered anyway really but this is what I refer to that shaded area that pale orange range I'm looking at the highest point of it the midpoint and the low there's three specific levels there I'm not in is I am big U.S it's not like here's a tree uh it's a supply Zone okay that's wonderful what are you going to trade at what level are you looking at so from a I don't know I guess a grade school perspective supply and demand may help someone you maybe you have been profitable with it but it doesn't give you a very specific level to trade on you have to determine where you're going to trade at so it's like here in this general area let's try to find something that's a buyer sell what I'm telling you is the algorithm itself will refer to one of those three price levels which price level do I use which one is it hidden at the time of the day did I tell you to look at it that's where time comes in so when I'm teaching you I'm teaching how the algorithm Works how it delivers price it operates on time delivery that means everything every price run is scheduled sorry I know you probably worked in an industry for a long time and you're probably cussing and laughing saying this guy's full of I don't see you out here telling everybody where it's going to go before it's going to go there to the infinite degree of precision that I'm showing so I'm I'm proving you I can't take you I can't take you somewhere on a field trip and say Here's Where the algorithm is ran from I can't take you to a place and say here is where it's operating from okay the only thing I can do is tell you the truth it is there it's running it's delivering price all the time it's completely manipulated it's absolutely controlled always and you shouldn't be fearful that you shouldn't be upset about that you should be thankful that that is an advantage because once you understand how it operates you can exploit that they're not going to change it because the way that price is offered and how markets are traded isn't going to change that's never going to change so there's no reason for you to worry about oh this is a fad it's gonna it's gonna stop working because everybody likes to use ICT Concepts folks this is the market the markets are until they do away with the markets entirely this is going to continue to work so put that aside don't be don't be afraid of that stuff you're wasting time worrying about things that aren't even a factor so the 13th of June I said that I want to look for and anticipate rather the Market's going to go up into that shaded area that's the weekly inversion Fairbank I've been treat that as a form of resistance and then gravitate down to I said this very candle right there that down closed candle I told you it was a bullish order block it's a change in a state of delivery that's what an order block is it's not every down closed candle or every up-close candle it's not the things you see people talking about on YouTube either many of the things that people are saying about my order block they're trying to use supply and demand logic and it's flawed that that's that's not that's not the same thing okay it's not I promise you it's not what's occurring here is at that candles open okay that candles opening price was the only marker where price can be measured in this time frame where price was offered down where was the next down closed candle right there so between those two down closed candles if we're looking for a cell model to begin which is what I was outlining on the 13th of June where could we expect that to form the fair value Gap that I shaded and I told you on the 13th it's an old weekly imbalance so if we leave and in Balance what was I teaching you on the weekly chart the market can be efficiently traded back and forth up and down think about that pain analogy when you paint your wall are you going to paint up the wall and when the paint runs out of a supply of paint on that roller you're just going to leave the areas where the paint didn't make it you're just going to go to somewhere else on the other part of the wall no you're going to roll right back over top of it why because you want your wall to be efficiently painted right well when I look at Price I'm looking at where price has been where it went to recently and was is there any pockets of inefficiency in there and because I start my analysis on the weekly chart why am I starting on the weekly chart because the whole weekly range is going to be predicated by what we anticipate on that Weekly Candlestick what's it going to do is it going to go higher or is it going


Okay, here's the organized and refined version of the provided text. I've aimed to retain every detail, nuance, and the original tone while structuring it for better readability and comprehension.

# **ICT Workshop: Continued Analysis and Market Insights (Cont.)**

## **Review of Weekly Chart Analysis and Anticipated Market Movement**

The key is to determine if the market will move higher to target buy stops above a previous high, or if it will target an inefficiency such as a fair value gap above the current market price. Conversely, if the market is expected to decline, it will likely target an inefficiency like a fair value gap below the current price.

*   This lower target was indicated on the weekly chart.
*   The candle was identified as an order block.
*   There was a strong belief that the market would decline to that level after using the shaded area as resistance.

This analysis allows for lower time frame analysis to confirm these theories.

## **Hourly Chart Analysis: Validating Anticipations**

Looking at an hourly chart, the focus shifts to the period around **June 13th**.

*   The goal is to observe how the price interacts with a specific gap.

The shaded area represents the frame of reference, extending from the high on **June 12th** to the current market price on **June 13th**.

*   This involves analyzing the price delivery within this range and predicting market movements, rather than reacting to them.
*   It was anticipated and articulated in the **June 13th** live stream that the **Dollar Index** would likely decline into the order block around 102.705 later in the week, specifically on Thursday and Friday.

It's important to determine whether the price used the shaded area to move upwards and then be rejected lower.

*   There appears to be sufficient evidence to suggest that the price action aligned with the anticipated movements.
*   This occurred on **Wednesday, June 14th, at 2 A.M.**, which corresponds to the **London Open Kill Zone (2 A.M. to 5 A.M. New York local time).**

**Note:** All time references are in **New York local time** because the algorithm operates on New York time, and the trading day is defined by New York.

*   The knowledge of when the higher low of a Forex market forms (London session, 2 A.M. to 5 A.M.) provides a significant advantage.
*   If the weekly bias suggests a bearish Dollar Index, attention will be directed to the anticipated draw down into these levels.

The purple shaded area (weekly fair value gap) is removed to focus on the daily bullish order block, which is a draw on liquidity, not necessarily an entry point for going long.

*   This order block did cause a rise, going into the same shaded area: the old weekly fair value gap/inversion fair value gap.
*   This area is being used as resistance.

## **Order Blocks and Fair Value Gaps**

The discussion then shifts to the consecutive up-close candles within this fair value gap.

*   These candles represent buy side delivery, which indicates upward movement.
*   The focus will be on the opening price to signify the start of the order block and the mean threshold (midpoint of the low to the high).
*   Price is allowed to trade to and through, but not close above the mean threshold.

The opening price is a key point in determining the change in the state of delivery.

*   The goal on **June 13th** was to study price action and see if it will hold up.
*   As a student, you need to look back through price action to see what PD array you like and what you use for your setup (optimal trade entry, fair value gap, 2022 model, Breakers).
*   There is no better PD array than another, not every single price run will have every single one of my PD arrays in it.

It's crucial to stick with one PD array until you are comfortable and consistent with it.

*   Tom Dick and Harry Styles may Rebrand my content in watered-down 5-minute videos.
*   These consecutive up-close candles are one order block within a range that I told you to treat as a inversion fair value gap.

## **Algorithm and Market Dynamics**

The algorithm will spend time in that area to allow smart money traders who have the knowledge to sell short here and buy at a lower price down where the order block is.

*   An order block is not visible on level two, it's where the market changes its state of delivery.
*   I told you to look at it on the 13th and then we look for signatures inside that range.

What does that mean?

*   Well you have an order block here.
*   You also have a breaker here.

High, low, higher high, consecutive down closed candles.

*   Same thing were applying here.
*   Push It Forward in time you're getting the same entry here.
*   The model call for a stop loss it's got to be above that high.
*   If you're using the last up close candle the same thing.
*   You don't get short here but you can be short here.
*   Where you enter is the least important factor in consistency.

## **Trading with Higher Time Frame Premise and Importance of Time**

You have to know where it's going because if you can determine where it's likely to go to, you can find a myriad of entry points. When price returned back up into this low here, you can be short.

*   What would you anticipate this rejection block which is the lowest down close?
*   That's your first draw below it, sell side.
*   Then you can start doing projections on all this price around here lower to see if it wants to dig in lower.
*   It's Friday it's already hit the mark here.

Did I outline the card before on the 13th of June you can use this as an entry going short?

*   You're trading with a higher time premise.
*   You're entering here, where's the model call for for stop loss?
*   It's got to be above that high.
*   If you're using the last up close candle the same thing.
*   You don't get short here but you can be short here.

The logic that you're applying to whatever Market you're Trading, whether you're trading the breaker which would have been a fill here or here. Price alone. Price alone. Those as that's the instances where price returned to the PD array. Now here is where you separate the men from the boys and the lions from the Sheep: TIME.

Just because price went up to that level right there at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, are you factoring a great deal of emphasis on a late afternoon dollar?

*   No, you want to focus on the relationships of what the dollars doing during key kill zones.
*   Dollar is going to be highly sensitive to Forex s p NASDAQ Dao it will use the longer term higher time draw of risk on risk off with a dollar.
*   The index can Flex against that.
*   You don't see that with Euro and cable unless dollars being manipulated held in consolidation which it's not being here it's being allowed to move gyrate move around that means that your Forex pairs can be free to move.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining every detail, nuance, and the original tone while structuring it for better readability and comprehension:

# **ICT Workshop: Continued Analysis and Market Insights (Cont.)**

## **Dollar Usage, Volatility, and Market Manipulation**

*   The Dollar Index tends to exhibit higher volatility. Therefore, emphasizing its usage in analysis is important because it serves as a more impactful driver of price when analyzing currencies in the longer term.
*   While dollar risk-on/risk-off sentiment will eventually influence stocks, it is important to acknowledge that stocks are currently subject to significant manipulation.
*   According to the original text, the current levels of the stock market are not justified by the underlying fundamentals of the companies trading within it.

Despite awareness of market conditions, the focus remains on:

*   Identifying opportunities
*   Trading based on what the market presents.
*   Focusing on opportunities available based on time.

## **Market Events and Economic Calendar Analysis**

The discussion shifts to **Wednesday at 2:00 AM New York local time**, highlighting a potential market event.

*   This involves anticipating the inception of major market manipulations based on the weekly chart and aligning it with calendar events.

### **Economic Calendar: A Smoke Screen?**

*   The economic calendar is examined for medium or high-impact news drivers.
*   These events are frequently used as a "smoke screen" to obscure the true market dynamics.
*   It's suggested that the market's movement is not always directly correlated with the information released during these high-impact news events.

### **Classical Perspective vs. Market Rejection**

*   The classical perspective assumes that market movements align with positive or negative data releases.
*   However, markets often reject this alignment, leading to explanations like "the market already priced that in."
*   These explanations are often used as an excuse for unexpected market behavior.
*   The economic calendar is viewed as a tool to anticipate market movements. It serves to provide awareness of the timing of likely price movements.
    *   Like using a TV Guide to know when a sporting event is scheduled to broadcast.
    *   The markets deliver price according to a schedule.

## **Time-Based Analysis and Key Kill Zones**

*   Focus on New York local time for analysis.
*   **Wednesday at 2:00 AM** is again highlighted.
*   The analysis moves to **Thursday**, focusing on the **London Open**.

### **London Open Kill Zone**

*   The London Open typically forms between **2:00 AM** and **5:00 AM New York local time.**
    *   Approximately 70% of the time, this is the case based on backtesting results.
*   It's crucial to consider the overall bias when anticipating a sell-off.

### **Applying Premise to Current Market Conditions (June 13th)**

*   On **June 13th**, a prediction was made that the dollar would move to a specific level, which was subsequently reached.

### **Addressing Potential Reversals**

Addressing the question of whether the market might reverse prematurely:

*   Longer-term perspectives reveal that the dollar has already reached into premiums on the weekly chart.
*   Multiple premium arrays have been targeted on the upside, and any inefficiencies have been addressed.
*   This makes it reasonable to anticipate a continued downward movement for the dollar.

## **Order Block Theory and Market Structure**

*   The current focus is on those who are attempting to "catch the bottom" and are long on the market.

### **Daily Order Block Analysis**

*   The analysis shifts to the daily chart to examine the order block, defined as the entire down-close candle range.
*   If bearish, the expectation is for the price to initially trade into the open of the order block, indicating a change in the state of delivery.
*   The price is then expected to reach for the mean threshold (midpoint).

### **Determining Continued Downward Movement**

*   How the market closes after hitting the mean threshold is key.
*   A close below the mean threshold suggests a likelihood of continued downward movement into the following week.

### **Bullish Order Blocks as Targets**

*   Even though considered to be a bullish order block, the area can be classified as a discount array.
*   Bullish order blocks are not always buying opportunities.
*   Instead, they can serve as targets and means of measuring order flow.
*   If the price closes below the mean threshold (half of the candle's body), this indicates potential for further decline into the next week.

### **Potential Downside Targets**

If the market continues lower, potential targets include:

*   Sell-side liquidity below the low of the candle being examined.
*   A small inefficiency in the form of a fair value gap.
*   A fair value gap in the form of a buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency, identified by the candle to the left and right of the candle being highlighted.

## **Weekend Trading and Gap Risk**

Discussion shifts to the risks associated with weekend trading.

*   Due to uncertainties and events occurring globally, the gap risk between Friday's close and Sunday's open can be significant.
*   Geopolitical issues and Health and Welfare concerns may cause increased gap risk

### **Focus on Day Trading**

*   Given current market conditions, a primary focus on day trading is recommended.
*   This strategy allows for more restful sleep at night.
*   Even the restart at 6 PM can create unexpected gaps, particularly in stock indices.

## **Lower Timeframe Analysis and Market Events**

*   A shift to a 15-minute candlestick chart is planned, following a short break.

### **Brief Intermission**

*   A pause is taken at **9:53 AM**, with a return scheduled for **10:00 AM**.
*   Viewers are encouraged to use the break to refresh and share their learning experiences.

## **Post-Break Discussion and Technical Analysis**

### **Audio Check and Engagement**

*   Upon returning, an audio check is conducted via Twitter.
*   Viewers are encouraged to "like" the video as a marker for future reference.

### **15-Minute Candlestick Chart Analysis (Dollar Index)**

The analysis resumes with a detailed, top-down perspective using the 15-minute candlestick chart for the dollar Index.

*   The intent is to provide clarity on identifying market draws based on experience and algorithmic tendencies.

### **Addressing Skepticism and Competition**

*   Addressing those that claim ICT's teaching is easy to follow, he retorts by claiming they cannot call out levels to the degree that he does.
*   The importance of direct engagement with shared information is emphasized. It should be stressed that making informed decisions requires firsthand experience rather than relying solely on opinions.

### **Weekly Inefficiency and Algorithm Utilization**

*   The discussion revisits the weekly inefficiency (weekly inversion fair value gap).
*   The key focus is to identify signatures indicating its utilization by the algorithm for resistance.

### **Key Kill Zones for Forex Traders**

*   For Forex traders analyzing the dollar Index, emphasis should be on the:
    *   **London Open Kill Zone**
    *   **New York Open Kill Zone**
*   **London Open Kill Zone:** **2:00 AM** to **5:00 AM New York local time.**
    *   Personal buffer: **1:00 AM** to **5:00 AM** to account for daylight savings time.
    *   Potential setups can occur as early as 1:00 AM.
    *   The volume typically tapers off at **5:00 AM.**

### **Dead Time and New York Open Kill Zone**

*   The period between **5:00 AM** and **7:00 AM** is referred to as "dead time."
*   The **New York Open Kill Zone** is classically defined as **7:00 AM** to **10:00 AM.**
    *   **7:00 AM** to **9:00 AM** is considered the "sweet spot" for Forex trading setups.

### **London Open Kill Zone (Revisited)**

*   **ICT London Open Kill Zone:** **2:00 AM** and **5:00 AM New York local time.**
*   Knowing where the weekly candlestick is likely to draw to is essential.
*   There is no shortcut to the process, it is imperative to trade to defined levels and locations.

### **Simplifying Market Movements**

*   Market movements are essentially binary: price is either going up or going down.
*   The weekly chart should be used to define the direction.
*   If a market has been efficiently delivered within a range and then leaves that range, it's likely to expand lower, reaching for an old low or a fair value gap below price.
*   The reverse is also true.

### **Avoiding Complications**

*   Avoid incorporating external indicators or retail-based perspectives (e.g., supply and demand, harmonic patterns).
*   The core principles are not complicated: price moves up or down for specific reasons.

## **Precision and Risk Management**

The content then discusses predictability and risk management in trading.

### **Market Predictability**

*   Every price run is not a surprise, unless it is an event such as a wartime scenario.
*   Unless there is manual intervention, such as a surprise rate announcement.

### **Risk Awareness and Unexpected Events**

*   Acknowledging the potential for unexpected events that can disrupt even the best strategies.
*   Mentioning the de-pegging of the Euro against the Swiss franc as an example of an unforeseen event that caused significant financial losses.
*   The Swiss Franc event resulted in brokerage firms going insolvent and billions of dollars in losses.
*   Such events highlight the ever-present risk in trading.
*   Therefore, risk management is paramount.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining every detail, nuance, and the original tone while structuring it for better readability and comprehension:

# **Risk Management, Market Analysis, and Kill Zones**

## **Risk Assessment and Personal Trading Decisions**

*   The markets inherently possess risk.
*   It's essential to be mindful of this risk.
*   Whether that risk paralyzes you and prevents you from trading is a personal decision.
*   The decision to trade with live money is also a personal one.
    *   The instructor emphasizes that he does not dictate when someone is ready to trade live.
    *   However, he can often identify those who are not ready.

## **Fibonacci Analysis and Key Price Levels**

*   Using Fibonacci retracements to identify specific price levels.

### **Range Measurement**

*   Measuring the range between a high and a low point.
*   Precision to the exact pip is not crucial.
*   Applying a Fibonacci retracement tool to this range.

### **Specific Price Levels**

*   The Fibonacci tool is used solely to highlight the relationship between three specific price levels taught to students.

### **Example Price Points**

*   High: 103.445
*   Low: 103.226
    *   These values may not represent the absolute high and low of the weekly candles defining the range.
    *   However, they are considered "close enough."
*   Midpoint: 103.336

## **Understanding Market Gaps**

Differentiating between fair value gaps and real liquidity voids:

*   **Real Liquidity Void (Gap):**
    *   An area with no overlapping wick or candle body.
    *   Price opens at one point and closes at another, leaving a complete void of price data in between.
*   **Fair Value Gap (Inefficiency):**
    *   Exemplified by a buy-side imbalance and sell-side inefficiency.
*   Gaps, whether liquidity voids or inefficiencies, are measured from the highest high to the lowest low of that respective gap.

### **Consequent Encroachment**

*   The midpoint of a gap is referred to as "consequent encroachment."
*   As price fills in a gap, it's more likely to gravitate towards the midpoint than the extreme high or low.
*   **Bearish Scenario:**
    *   The upper end of an inefficiency or gap should be treated as a premium (resistance).
    *   The market should not "dig into" or retrace above this level if a sell model is in effect.
    *   The strongest downward moves will often exhibit this characteristic.
*   **Examples in Price Action:**
    *   Instances where candle bodies show slight movement above the upper end of a gap, but price respects the midpoint.

### **Confirmation and Assumptions**

*   Referring to a previous live stream on June 13th:
    *   Anticipating that a specific shaded level would act as resistance.
    *   This level was intended as a point for smart money to initiate short trades.
    *   The target for these trades was a bullish order block on the daily chart.

### **Trading Mindset**

*   Whenever terms like "premium array" are used:
    *   Envision it being treated as resistance.
    *   Expect the inception of a cell program.
    *   Recognize the anticipated target based on the instructor's 30 years of experience.
*   The Instructor provides bias and cuts through market complexities.
*   The aim is to provide the information and decisions that lead to perfectly timed successful decisions.
*   Do not be bothered by the length of time it takes to explain it.
    *   It is not an easy one, two, three program and there is no one, two, three precision out there.
    *   You will never come to the conclusions that are shown as consistently as they are with anything else in the market.

## **Anticipating Market Movements**

*   When the instructor shares opinions on market movements (via tweets, Twitter spaces, or live streams):
    *   Pay close attention.
    *   Anticipate the shaded area being treated as the beginning of a downward move.
    *   The "terminus" or end of the move is the "low-hanging fruit."
*   This does not imply the end of all downward movement.
*   It defines a trade setup.

### **Elements of a Trade**

*   Every element making up a trade requires multiple factors.
    *   Inception of a move (where it begins).
    *   A narrative reason supporting the trade's formation.
        *   This narrative justification has been outlined by explaining the current chart dynamics.

## **Kill Zones and Trading Biases**

*   Utilizing specific time periods of the day (kill zones).
    *   **London Open:** 2:00 AM to 5:00 AM New York local time.
*   **Bias:**
    *   If the weekly chart indicates a likely downward expansion.
    *   80% of the bias problem is solved.
    *   No need to wait for calendar events to confirm or negate the idea.

### **Navigating News Drivers**

*   The discussion navigates medium to high-impact news drivers (FOMC, CPI, etc.).
*   Don't trade ahead of the initial move.
*   Focus on market sentiment shifts after the information is released.
*   Avoid focusing on raw data.
    *   The actual data is not the primary driver.
    *   Anticipate volatility.
    *   Identify where stop losses reside after the initial move (above old highs or below lows).
    *   The location of these highs and lows is not known before CPI or FOMC releases.

### **Avoiding Gambling**

*   Don't trade based on guessing where a "dart" will land.
    *   This is considered gambling.
    *   It lacks skill.
    *   The goal is to avoid happenstance and increase skill.

### **Economic Calendar as a Tool**

*   Wait for the initial manipulation to occur.
*   The economic calendar provides the timing for these reports.
*   The market doesn't move because of the report itself.
    *   The data is already known by "the powers that be."
    *   The report release serves as a "smoke screen."
    *   These events are used as justification for market movements.
    *   When the market reacts favorably to data, it's attributed to the data.
    *   When it doesn't, it's explained away as "priced in."

## **Decision-Making and Daily Chart Monitoring**

*   Identifying where the market is expected to react is key.
*   **Daily Chart:**
    *   Used for decision-making (day trades, short-term trades, etc.).
    *   The bias is derived from the weekly chart and its likely draw.
    *   Monitor how each daily candle forms.
*   **Bearish Expectations:**
    *   Monitor how price gravitates toward the bullish order block.
    *   Determine if the algorithm offers price to the shaded area.
    *   If price enters this area, note the time of day.
*   **Dollar Analysis:**
    *   Primary focus is identifying the high of the day.
    *   Where will the high of the day form in a market trading at a level where a reaction is expected?
    *   The expectation is the inception of a down move between one of three levels: the high end of a shaded area, midpoint, or low of that shaded area.

## **Inefficiencies and Trading Frameworks**

*   **Bearish Scenario (Inefficiencies):**
    *   If using an inefficiency as the basis for a trade:
        *   The inefficiency should be treated as a premium array for selling off.
        *   The upper portion should not be respected.
            *   If it's not, it indicates a strong probability for a downward trade through the order block.

## **Kill Zone Indicator and High-Touch Analysis**

*   London open Killzone Analysis
    *   Annotations are drawn by hand, "High touch over high tech."
    *   Annotations become more meaningful
    *   Annotations can be meditation

### **Weekly Chart Transposition**

*   The weekly fair value gap (old inversion) is transposed to lower time frames.
    *   Annotations on the weekly chart are shown on all time frames.
    *   Highlight the array being annotated on the weekly chart.
    *   Select "current interval and below" or "all intervals".
    *   Annotations are visible on every time frame (weekly, daily, 4-hour, 15-minute, etc.).

### **London Open Kill Zone**

*   Within the London Open Killzone annotation box, the following are likely to occur:
    *   Trade begins
    *   Shift in Market Structure
    *   High of the day forms.
*   70% probability that the high of the day will form between 2:00 AM and 5:00 AM New York local time.

### **Other Ingredients Required**

*   Having a narrative in mind
    *   The instructor gave the narrative on the 13th.
*   Longer term students know that if the market is bearish, you do not want to see all of the inefficiency respected.
*   The inefficiency that is used can be a breakaway gap or fair value gap.

## **Consequent Encroachment Analysis**

*   Once the market has traded within the range it is being treated as resistance.
*   This means price can trade up to the low and reject or trade up to the midpoint.
*   If price is trading to Consequent Encroachment
*   The high is bumped and is showing a willingness to go lower.
*   Price has spent time within the range.
*   Efficiently delivered
    *   Moving up and down
    *   Keying off of the levels being focused on within the shaded area.

### **Model 2022 Example**

*   Buy Side Taken
*   Shift in Market Structure
*   Fair Value Gap

### **New York Open Kill Zone**

*   Occurs at 8 AM which is within the 7 AM to 9 AM heart of the New York Open Killzone.

### **London vs New York**

*   London is the London Open Killzone
*   New York is the New York Killzone
*   Here is the Premium Array.
*   Range is from high to low.
*   50% a premium is at or higher than that.
*   Does the fair value gap qualify as a premium array relative to that high and low? Yes
*   Is price returning back up to that shaded area? Yes
*   Where specifically? the low end of it. It doesn't need to go back up to consequent encroachment.
*   Consequent encroachment showed the signature that we would look for it left the upper portion untraded to again worked off the low of that Gap.
*   Add levels to your chart.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining every detail, nuance, and the original tone while structuring it for better readability and comprehension:

# **Chart Annotations, Market Understanding, and Trading Consistency**

## **Chart Annotations and Note-Taking**

*   Initially, annotate charts directly for familiarity.
*   With experience, shift to using a notepad for reference.
*   Eventually, experienced traders may work with naked charts, but this requires significant time and practice.
*   Staying organized is crucial for avoiding confusion when analyzing multiple time frames.

## **Understanding Market Moves**

*   Having higher time frame logic and reference points helps demystify seemingly random market moves.
*   The speaker contrasts this with the confusion often seen on social media.

### **Community Perspective**

*   The community might be perceived as arrogant or narcissistic due to their understanding of the market.
*   There is confidence in knowing what to look for, how it will form, and when to act.
*   Outsiders may react negatively, but the speaker does not care.

### **Market Repetition**

*   The speaker emphasizes that these patterns repeat every week.
*   Not every day offers the same opportunities; some setups are more favorable during periods of higher volatility.

## **Trading Framework and Mindset**

*   A higher time frame (weekly chart) provides a framework for "one shot, one kill" setups.
*   The goal is to capture a significant portion of the weekly range, not necessarily the entire range.

### **Analogy: Eating Chicken**

*   The analogy of eating a chicken bone is used: focus on the "meat" of the move, not the small scraps.
*   The speaker's concepts aim to identify where the "meat" is.
*   While pinpointing the absolute high and low is possible, it's not always necessary.

### **Mentorship Approach**

*   The mentorship is for those who want to know everything.
*   The speaker identifies as a "freak" and a "control freak" who wants to understand every aspect of market behavior.
*   The speaker aims to know how the market will fail, enabling the speaker to avoid unfavorable situations.

## **Consistency and Avoiding Market Traps**

*   The speaker's consistency comes from understanding where the market is likely to fail.
*   Others focus on constant profitability and may overlook potential pitfalls.
*   The speaker emphasizes understanding when the market can "trick" you, even with superior analysis.

### **Avoiding Emotional Trading**

*   The speaker warns against reading into price action based on emotions or social media influences (e.g., jealousy, competition).
*   Trading decisions should not be driven by a desire to "show" someone or outdo others.
*   Instead, one must adhere to the rules, focusing on time and price within the weekly outline.

### **Weekend Preparation**

*   Between Friday's close and Sunday's opening, dedicate time to meditating on the weekly chart.
*   Determine the likely direction, momentum, and targets.
*   Transposing these ideas to lower time frames enhances clarity and highlights missed opportunities.

## **Applying Concepts to Charts**

*   The speaker will use the idea of how far price runs can go as a frame of reference
*   The speaker will go back up to the daily chart.
*   The speaker will encapsulate that entire down closed candle.
*   The speaker is using yellow to highlight this.
*   The speaker doesn't really like yellow.

### **Bullish Order Block**

*   The expectation is to see if price wants to gravitate lower and enter the area.
*   A 15-minute chart is used for further analysis.
*   The range represents the entirety of the order block.
*   The expectation is to see it trade down to consequent encroachment and go below it.
*   This would indicate weakness and provide momentum for long holders of stock index futures and foreign currency.

### **Trigger Swing and Fibonacci Extensions**

*   This move is the "trigger swing" and a measuring point for Fibonacci extensions.
*   The Fibonacci tool is anchored from high to low of that price swing.
*   Settings are standard deviation 3 and 2.5.
*   The Fibonacci is used solely for math, not for complex patterns like bat or crab patterns.
*   The focus is on the range that matters.
*   There must be a confluence of time, specifically London close.

### **London Close Kill Zone**

*   London close begins at 10:00 AM New York time and ends at noon, with a buffer extending to 1:00 PM on high-runoff days.
*   Using 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM New York time as the London close Kill Zone will serve well.
*   The speaker enjoys teaching this information and expresses that he should have charged admission.

## **Market Dynamics and Anticipation**

*   The speaker wants listeners to look at "these mysterious markets."
*   The goal is to identify where price can begin a move and where it can gravitate towards, framing it as "low hanging fruit."
*   The Inception of a move can be timed and determined within a specific price level or range (e.g., inefficiency).
*   Within that range, there are three specific price levels used on a bullish or bearish basis.

### **Referencing Previous Analysis**

*   The speaker refers to a previous expectation that a shaded area on the weekly chart (old inversion fair value gap) would act as resistance.
*   The algorithm would trade up into it during time.
*   It reacted near the midpoint (consequent encroachment) of the range.
*   This occurred at 1:00 AM, during the European open.
*   The most important rule is the high of the day forms between 2:00 AM and 5:00 AM.

### **London Open Kill Zone Confirmation**

*   At 2:45 AM, the market bumps the high.
*   This creates the high of the day during the London open Kill Zone, with a 70% probability when bearish.

### **Trade Management**

*   The level outlined on June 13th is the "low hanging fruit" objective.
*   This is used to frame the idea of taking a trade with that level as the draw on liquidity.
*   Every trade is entered with a "best case scenario" in mind.
*   The speaker acknowledges potential outcomes: stop-outs, failure to reach targets, and changing market opinions.
*   Exits are a continuous work in progress.

## **Entry Strategies and Confluence**

*   The speaker acknowledges that there are 81 entry strategies to choose from.
*   The high, low, higher high breaker pattern is mentioned as one strategy.
*   The classic ICT optimal trade entry (OTE), a three-quarter pullback, is discussed.
*   Entering on the fair value gap, based on the 2022 model, is another option.

### **Using Fibonacci and Market Structure**

*   The run from one point to another is measured, with a standard deviation of negative 2.5 on the FIB.
*   This is just outside the scope of the daily bullish order block.
*   Mean threshold applies to order blocks, while consequent encroachment applies to inefficiencies or gaps.
*   Trading through the mean threshold indicates potential for lower prices and holding a partial position.

### **Friday Considerations and Day Trading**

*   The speaker does not hold positions over the weekend due to gap risk.
*   Day trading is presented as a preferable strategy in the current market environment.

### **Confluence and Stop Loss Usage**

*   The speaker uses a confluence of a negative 2.5 Fibonacci level, occurring at the London Close Kill Zone, and respects the low end of the old weekly gap.
*   A stop loss is used to manage risk if the market moves against the trade.
*   The speaker notes a 70% likelihood of success when the narrative aligns with the weekly chart direction.

## **Learning and Real-Time Application**

*   The speaker acknowledges getting stopped out sometimes.
*   The speaker shares winning trades and losses transparently.
*   The speaker tells people what is going to happen beforehand.
*   The speaker says that you should be using this to study in real time.
*   The speaker aksed, "Are you going through your charts and looking at it like this?"
*   The speaker also mentioned, "Are you marking up your charts like this this is a perfect example what I'm telling this you should be doing these things this is what you do when I say back test"
*   The speaker is suggesting a mock-up forward walk test.
*   The speaker then ends with,"I'm saying you go back and look at all moves and you annotate your"


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining every detail, nuance, and the original tone while structuring it for better readability and comprehension:

# **Chart Analysis, Market Objectives, and Partial Exits**

## **Chart Annotations and Objective Setting**

*   Save charts with annotations that detail how the high was formed and the continuation in the New York session.
*   Annotate how price delivered to a confluence of standard deviation negative 2.5 and breached the low of the order block.
*   The **daily order block's** first threshold is the area to initially target.
*   Consider this as a "low hanging fruit" objective.
*   It's not necessary for price to reach all targets; reaching the initial objective is sufficient.

## **Partial Exits and Managing Trades**

*   The first partial target could be below a specific low or at the consequent encroachment of a wick.
*   Either low is valid for a first partial exit.
*   The speaker allows for personal touches in trade management.
*   Determine how much to take off at the first partial based on personal comfort level.
*   When first learning, take the most off at the first partial because mistakes are common.
*   Profitability doesn't always equate to correct analysis.
*   Analysis should allow for being wrong but still profitable.
*   Always look for ways to secure profits, but exits must be predetermined.

## **Anticipating Market Moves and Liquidity Pools**

*   When anticipating a move from a high down to a specific level:
    *   Identify pools of liquidity or inefficiencies to the left.
    *   Disqualify certain areas (e.g., recently acted-upon imbalances).
*   The speaker uses "this" as a term, referring to specific market behavior.
*   The movement discussed represents a buy-side imbalance followed by sell-side inefficiency.
*   A down-closed candle provides repricing to this inefficiency, forming the framework for a Judas swing for the New York open.
*   The run from a specific high to a low represents Power Three.
    *   **Power Three** is not limited to daily candlesticks; it can be used on any time frame.
*   The false move up to the low of the old weekly fair value gap is key.

## **Confirmations and Trading Rules**

*   Confirmation of a move lower comes from the London session.
*   If bearish, the London high forms, and the market breaks down and retraces in New York, it's likely to continue lower.
*   In this scenario, you can't use recent price action as a target. You want to see it go, at a minimum, below that low.
*   Taking the largest portion off at the first partial is not incorrect, especially when new.
*   The focus is on trading instruments with significant movement (e.g., Euro/USD, Pound/USD, Aussie/USD, New Zealand/USD), not the Dollar Index.
*   Aim to see price move down to the minimum level.
*   Take a partial at the minimum level, then consider another partial below the subsequent low or wick.

## **Wick Considerations and Partial Exits**

*   Whenever there's a wick, always, always, always take partials at its consequent encroachment if your position allows.
*   This rule applies to every single trade, regardless of who provides the analysis.
*   If price trades to the consequent encroachment of a wick, it might reverse, consolidate, or retrace from there.
*   Consequent encroachment of wicks and tails are crucial partial exit points.
*   Factor in spread when determining the partial exit point.
*   If short, look for the midpoint of the wick and slightly above it.
*   This rule is considered "cast in stone" with no deviations.

## **Trading Within a Range**

*   When trading inside a range (high to target low), that target represents the "low-hanging fruit" objective.
*   This doesn't mean price can't go lower, but it's the expected draw on the downside.
*   Between that high and target low, look for inefficiencies.
*   Disqualify any recently used imbalances.
*   Gaps can be used as objectives or partial exit points below a low.
*   For back-to-back wicks, use the longest one.
*   Measure from the close to the low, divide by half, and add a bit for spread.
*   Take a partial at this level, even if there isn't a low present.
*   Failing to notice these wicks can lead to stop-outs or reversals.
*   Consequent encroachment of the wick is where the algorithm may reverse without reaching the full target.
*   Ignoring these wicks can cause the market to reverse and run your stop.

## **Entry Strategies and Market Timing**

*   Enter at the New York open between 7:00 AM and 9:00 AM at a predetermined price level.
*   This level was communicated on June 13th as the low of the inefficiency and the consequent encroachment of the inefficiency.
*   Time, price, and other factors must align.
*   Once the low is broken, it is unknown whether it will reach any lower objective.
*   Trust that price will reach the target, which is why a stop loss is necessary.
*   Trade with risk management, and the stop loss is essential for this.

## **Assessing Market Strength and Order Blocks**

*   After a low is broken, assess how energetically it was done.
*   Ideally, the subsequent candle opens and trades up into the range of the previous candle (high to low).
*   Then, the market should break lower, treating the candle as an order block.
*   It doesn't need to close below it.
*   **Mean threshold** is important when targeting order blocks or continuations.
*   Closing below the mean threshold indicates a higher probability (not a promise) of further downward movement.
*   If a new up-close candle is formed in a sell program, the target is the daily bullish order block.
*   The full range of that order block is shaded in yellow.

## **Analyzing Price Action and Fair Value Gaps**

*   The mean threshold of the order block is at 102.565 in this specific example.
*   The market easily moved through that and outside the range of the order block.
*   Now, the mean threshold becomes critical.
*   Ideally, the market should not retrace back into the upper portion of that order block.
*   This area can be treated as a fair value gap that should remain open.
*   This concept applies similarly to other instruments (e.g., Euro/USD, ES, NQ).
*   However, the speaker does not trade the Dollar Index, but uses it as a barometer.
*   The speaker acknowledges the difficulty of performing detailed annotations while actively trading.
*   These annotations represent the mental checklist used while managing positions.
*   Identify fair value gaps clearly.
*   The market can trade up to the midpoint (mean threshold), slightly above the candle's high, and then resume going lower.
*   This represents institutional order flow entry.
*   The speaker emphasizes trusting that the full range of the order block is not needed.
*   Relating back to knowledge of order blocks: do not try to teach what you don't understand.

## **Market Timing and Confluence**

*   The speaker emphasizes how they trade down into targets until reaching certain times.
*   Highs formed in the London open align with taught principles.
*   If bearish, the high forms between 2:00 AM and 5:00 AM New York local time.
*   If true, there is a high probability of continuation in the same direction during the New York session.
*   The high forms in London, and there's a specific price area to watch.
*   The midpoint of an old gap is watched, and the low becomes a sensitive price point.
*   This price level must be traded to at the time of day that the algorithm references for new delivery.
*   New delivery means a lower low in the day.
*   The market moves higher into the New York open, aligning time and price.
*   Then, there's an acceleration to the downside until London close starts at 10:00 AM.
*   At 10:00 AM, watch if price hits your target(s).
*   If so, the market is in a position to potentially reverse.
*   London close generally marks the extreme end of the day.
*   If the high of the day forms in London, the low of the day generally forms between 10:00 AM and noon.
*   Backtest this information on your charts every single day.
*   Have a minimum of seven examples to analyze.
*   Fill in all annotation areas with observations.
*   Congratulate yourself on how well the levels played out.
*   The level expected on June 13th to be respected as resistance (the old weekly inversion fair value gap) was respected.
*   This initiated the framework in the London open, creating the high of the day.
*   Price traded all the way down as taught in numerous YouTube videos, years and years of content.
*   The rules have never changed; it's always the same.
*   The algorithm is not changing; it won't. Period.

## **Market Longevity and Continuation of Logic**

*   The logic of the market will be used until we are no longer trading.
*   The speaker indicates that if the market stops working, it will be because trading is no longer permitted, a situation that implies bigger problems than just trading.
*   As long as markets are offered to trade, this logic will always be used. Period.
*   The speaker wants the listeners to keep all that in mind and move to a daily chart.
*   This leads to a segue to Euro/USD, an instrument considered completely random.
*   A break is scheduled for 11:30 for five minutes.
*   This is in response to a participant asking when they can take a break.

## **Euro/USD Analysis and Mirror Images**

*   Referencing the 13th, there's a small gap and an order block.
*   The entire range of the order block is encapsulated in that area.
*   Yesterday, price traded up into it.
*   Today, there was a significant move outside of it, supported by weakness in the Dollar Index.
*   The speaker will not spend too much time on this because everything shown in the Dollar Index should mirror what's seen in Euro/USD.
*   The speaker will drop down to an hourly chart due to time constraints and content volume.
*   Otherwise, the discussion could extend late into the night, which the speaker's wife may not allow.

## **Hourly Chart and Gravitational Pull**

*   Looking for price to eventually gravitate from the 13th up into that gap.
*   Let me scrub it.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining every detail, nuance, and the original tone while structuring it for better readability and comprehension:

# **Euro/USD Chart Analysis: Annotations, Market Dynamics, and Trading Strategies**

## **Chart Annotations and Precision**

*   When annotating charts, especially when journaling, anchor annotations and lines from higher timeframe charts.
*   When dropping down to lower timeframes, ensure these annotations toggle to very specific levels.
*   This ensures charts are neat and precise.
*   This obsessive-compulsive attention to detail prevents overlooking key levels and their references to specific times of day.
*   If you are going to learn, do it right; otherwise, you waste an opportunity.

## **Mitigation Blocks and Market Structure**

*   On the 13th, the market drops down, taking out sell-side liquidity.
*   Analyze the high: Is it a breaker or a mitigation block?
*   A **breaker** in a bullish scenario would show a low, a high, and then a lower low.
*   In this case, the market shows a low, a high, and a higher low, indicating it's *not* a breaker.
*   Therefore, the high is a **mitigation block**.
    *   A mitigation block's definition relies on this distinctive feature.
*   Take the range of the mitigation block into account.

## **Precision in Price Action: The "Mohawk" Concept**

*   The low of the identified candle on the chart is 1.07746.
*   The subsequent candle's low is 1.07741, respecting the level.
*   Price "colors outside the line" slightly, but rallies, respecting the bodies of the candles.
*   Remember the distinction between *wicks* versus *bodies*: **Wicks do the damage.**
*   Account for these "Mohawks" or slight deviations.
*   A **Mohawk** is defined as:
    *   A price action with a small wick that extends just outside the expected lines (high, low, range defining an imbalance).
    *   It represents price coloring outside the lines and is permissible.
    *   The term "Mohawk" allows for spread.
*   This concept allows for spread, so minor wicks outside a level or fair value gap are acceptable if price quickly returns.
*   Don't panic if there's a one- or two-tick deviation.
*   Allow for these minor deviations when executing trades.
*   Seeing these deviations repeatedly builds trust in observations and price reading.

## **London Open Kill Zone and Judas Swing**

*   The market accelerates during the London Open Kill Zone (2:00 AM) on the 14th.
*   Sell-side liquidity is taken out.
*   This is a **Judas Swing**.
*   The market rallies quickly up into levels communicated on the 13th.
*   The speaker indicated that the market would move all the way up to the high of the day and through it.

## **Dollar Index Correlation and Managing Uncertainty**

*   If you trade Euro/Dollar, constantly refer to and compare it with the Dollar Index.
*   Everything seen in the Dollar Index should mirror Euro/USD.
*   Constantly get feedback relating your market to the Dollar Index.
*   If the Dollar Index is expected to go lower, and you're struggling to hold a winning trade, manage uncertainty by:
    *   Setting a stop loss at a comfortable level.
    *   Moving the stop loss to half of the open profit.
    *   Referring to the Dollar Index.
*   Look for signatures to support a complete run-off and further downward movement.

## **Time of Day and Profit-Taking**

*   Upon entering **London Close**, take the majority of the trade off.
*   London Close is generally the time when the market makes the opposite end of the daily range.
*   Consider these factors:
    *   It's Friday.
    *   London Close (10:00 AM to 12:00 PM New York Local Time)
*   Between 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM, currency trading volume starts to decrease.
*   While afternoon fluctuations can occur, the bulk of volume is between 2:00 AM and 12:00 PM New York local time.
*   Avoid afternoon trading in currencies.

## **Trading Rules and Partial Exits**

*   Have rules to ignore potential blow-off moves.
*   Close up shop between 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM New York local time, especially if targets have been hit.
*   Leaving a very small portion of the trade running is acceptable, but understand it might get stopped out.
*   Be okay with being wrong and realize that you're never going to be fully satisfied with exits.
*   The goal is to find profitability in every trade.
*   Partial exits are always available.
*   Allowance for partial exists is a personal aspect of trading.

## **Personalizing Trading Strategies**

*   Taking speaker's information and concepts and making them your model is uniquely yours.
*   Engage with price action in a way you are comfortable.
*   Never trade outside parameters defined for yourself.
*   Apply time and price theory.
*   This approach is consistent over time and has been taught for years.
*   These patterns repeat every week.
*   "Every week, every day, and it won't stop because this is the marketplace."

## **Five-Minute Chart Analysis and London Open**

*   Review how the market traded up on the 15th using a five-minute chart.
*   On the 15th, sell-side liquidity was present.
*   A classic London Open signature involves a stop run, seeking sell-side or buy-side liquidity.
*   It's difficult to confidently buy the sell stops.
*   It is easier to wait for the run and then judge if it has displacement higher.
*   Look for a swing high after stops are taken.
*   Does it drop down into it and rally energetically?

## **Silver Bullet for Euro and Objectives**

*   Once the market clears the high at 3:55 AM (between 2:00 AM and 5:00 AM), the fair value gap is the Silver Bullet for Euro for that day.
*   Trading to that level is sufficient.
*   The time the market is at that level is 4:20 AM.
*   It rallies up to the low of that fair value gap.
*   The low of that fair value gap is the "low-hanging fruit" objective (as discussed on June 13th).
*   It's not necessary for price to reach the mean threshold (half of the shaded area representing the order block on the daily chart).
*   Frame the trade based on getting into that fair value gap.
*   The inefficiency (gap) takes precedence over the order block.
*   This is where you would see it reach for the minimum target.

## **Breaker Blocks and New York Open Kill Zone**

*   Does the market react there? Yes.
*   The market trades back down into a low, high, and lower low, which forms a bullish breaker.
*   Extend it in time.
*   The New York Open Kill Zone (7:00 AM to 9:00 AM) offers a sweet spot.
*   The market rallies.

## **Fulcrum Points and Measured Moves**

*   Determine a **fulcrum point**.
*   The fulcrum point is crucial because if price runs through this high, you can start making measurements using standard deviation.
*   From the low to that high, project standard deviation levels (negative two, negative one and a half, one).
*   This is a measured move.
*   Take the largest portion of the trade off at standard deviation levels.

## **Order Blocks and Standard Deviations**

*   The standard deviation levels are in close proximity to the high of the order block.
*   The shaded area represents the up-close candle.
*   Measure from the low to the high.
*   The fulcrum point means that when price trades to it and through it, it has to go through it before you can get any of these measurements.
*   At the high of the order block, it could easily stop and consolidate into the rest of the day, then continue on Sunday into Monday.
*   Consider taking partials there.
*   Negative one and a half and two standard deviations represent a very extended move.
*   Two standard deviations represent Asian range or Central Bank Dealers Range extension.
*   Have a small piece on if you're going to leave a runner on, especially at two standard deviations.

## **Time of Day and Market Expectations**

*   By 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM New York local time (London close), you usually see the move peter out.
*   When markets are going down or expecting a daily down-closed candle:
    *   Between 2:00 AM and 5:00 AM, the high generally forms.
    *   Between 7:00 AM and 9:00 AM New York local time, the New York session creates a continuation pattern.
*   Sometimes, there's a reversal where London creates a high and sells off, but New York runs out to London's high and then reverses, making a lower close in the day.
*   Those reversals are usually driven by higher medium-impact news.
*   How do you know when the low won't be taken out or the high will be taken out in London?
*   You can trust the New York session.

## **Running Down Equity and Market Symmetry**

*   There's a lot of consolidation in the market.
*   If long on Euro, taking profit as price moves higher is called **running down equity**.
*   This is where you sell at new highs.
*   If long and the position has been running for a long time (e.g., since 8:00 AM), it's good practice to sell every time it makes a new high.
*   Euro makes higher highs while the dollar doesn't make lower lows simultaneously.
*   Market symmetry suggests the US dollar should make a lower low in concert with the higher high in Euro.
*   This is a USDX SMT divergence.
*   This makes one cautious to expect higher prices.
*   Be content with closing all long positions on Euro/Dollar and going into the weekend.

## **Study Resources**

*   For study, watch the June 13th live stream on the speaker's YouTube channel.
*   Go to the 7 minute and 22nd mark on that video.
*   You'll hear an outline of the mentioned levels and the entire range.
*   This explains the draw and liquidity mentioned on the 13th.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining every detail, nuance, and the original tone while structuring it for better readability and comprehension:

# **SMT Divergences, Time-Based Trading, and Market Analysis**

## **SMT Divergences: Understanding Correlated Asset Relationships**

*   The speaker discusses **SMT (Smart Money Technique/Tool) diversions**.
*   The speaker states they have never really settled on a consistent name for the idea; using the terms *smart money technique* or *smart money tool* interchangeably.
*   It involves analyzing the relationship between:
    *   Closely correlated assets.
    *   Inversely correlated assets.
*   Example: Euro/Dollar usually moves *higher* when the Dollar Index moves *lower*.
*   SMT Divergence occurs when these assets *disagree*.
*   **Symmetrical Market Conditions:**
    *   Euro/Dollar makes a higher high, Dollar Index makes a lower low.
    *   Euro/Dollar makes a lower low, Dollar Index makes a higher high.
*   **Asymmetrical Market Conditions (SMT Divergence):**
    *   Euro/Dollar higher high, Dollar Index *doesn't* make a lower low.
    *   Euro/Dollar lower low, Dollar Index *doesn't* make a higher high.
*   Crucially, these divergences must occur during **key times of day** for Forex and currency pairs:
    *   London Open
    *   New York Open
    *   London Close
*   While Asian session trading is possible, this workshop focuses on higher volatility opportunities during the specified key times.
*   The aim is to identify where algorithmic price swings are likely to occur.
*   Every institutional price level formed in Forex and Dollar markets will primarily occur within the described timelines.
*   The speaker notes that when they first began teaching these concepts, skeptics dismissed them as "nonsense" or "hindsight."
*   However, consistent observation and pattern recognition will build trust in these predictable time-based reactions.
*   The foundational information shared allows traders to determine how price will react and trade towards specific levels.
*   Understanding *how* and *why* these patterns form, and what price is reaching for, reduces uncertainty.

## **Time-Based Trading: Rules and Personal Weaknesses**

*   The speaker emphasizes the importance of being "done" trading Euro/Dollar by a certain time.
*   Specifically, they mention closing trades around 11:24 AM.
*   Even if Euro/Dollar continues higher while the Dollar Index makes a lower low, the speaker would *miss* the move.
*   The speaker admits a personal struggle: an obsessive-compulsive tendency to re-enter trades and attempt to "justify" their actions.
*   **Therefore, rules are essential**:
    *   Once the speaker concludes that the time of day suggests the opposite end of the daily range is forming.
*   This means:
    *   For Dollar, the low is likely forming between 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM New York local time.
    *   For Euro/Dollar, the high is likely forming between 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM New York local time.
*   While Forex and currency pairs can "bleed over" into the afternoon New York session, the speaker *avoids* trading them then.
*   Their focus transitions from Forex to stock index futures.
*   A typical trading day involves:
    *   Forex overnight.
    *   Bond trading in the morning.
    *   Overlap with index futures *or* finishing the day in Forex at London close.
    *   New York lunch hour trading of stop runs in stock index futures.
    *   Afternoon bond trade, potentially Market on Close.
*   The speaker switched from Forex back to their roots in index futures trading.
*   They emphasize that everything taught in this context, including concepts already on their YouTube channel, is applicable to index futures as well.
*   The teaching approach mirrors one-on-one mentorship, focusing on:
    *   Reviewing previous week's predictions.
    *   Establishing a foundational understanding.
    *   Mid-week, guiding the student to identify their preferred trading style: hourly timeframe, scalping (15 minutes or less), short-term (daily chart, Power 3).
    *   Framing a model tailored to the student's chosen style for them to work with.
*   The speaker also plans to cover trading the FMC, non-farm payroll, and CPI data later.

## **Pound/Dollar Analysis and Fair Value Gaps**

*   The speaker transitions to analyzing the Pound/Dollar (Cable) market.
*   Reference is made to the **June 13th, 2023 live stream**, specifically from **14 minutes 25 seconds to 16 minutes 10 seconds**.
*   The speaker emphasized that what they were showing was foresight, *not* hindsight.
*   In that live stream, the speaker mentioned that Pound would likely move higher.
*   This expectation was based on the Dollar Index being expected to go lower.
*   As with Euro/Dollar, constantly refer back to the relationship between the Dollar Index and the market being traded.
*   It's essential to view *both* charts and cycle through different timeframes.
*   On June 13th, 2023, the speaker discussed how the British Pound would need to:
    *   Move into a Fair Value Gap.
    *   Go *above* it.
    *   Treat it as *support*.
    *Before a meaningful move up could occur.
*   The speaker specifically wanted to see it trade up into a shaded area representing a weekly gap.
*   This area represents an **inefficiency** defined by:
    *   A large down-closed candle.
    *   The high of the candle to the *right*.
    *   The low of the candle to the *right*.
*   Moving to a 60-minute chart, the speaker highlights the importance of the levels discussed on June 13th.
*   The speaker wanted to see the market trade up into the gap (which appears on the daily chart) and have it act as support.
*   There's a down-closed candle (order block) near the top end of that range.
*   Price expands outside of it, comes back down into the order block, and respects the level.
*   The speaker pinpoints the exact candle that touches the top end of the daily Fair Value Gap, referencing the specific timeframe in the June 13th, 2023 live stream for verification.
*   The speaker stated they wanted to see it trade, using the Fair Value Gap as support.
*   This permitted it to trade as much as consequent encroachment (the midpoint).
*   Because of the down-closed candle and the breaker pattern (low, high, lower low), a bullish breaker forms.
*   There's an order block that price traces down into, respecting the old daily gap as an inversion fair value gap.
*   The speaker cautions against oversimplification, warning against assuming it's just another optimal trade entry based solely on a Fair Value Gap.
*   Instead, the speaker emphasizes the need to see price trade *outside* of it and then come back *down*, as demonstrated on the daily candlestick.
*   The speaker reminds the audience to consider **Power 3** (accumulation, manipulation, and distribution).
*   Power 3 represented a major transition from relying on Larry Williams' teachings.
*   The speaker mentions that they used to try to apply *everything* learned from Williams, which was a mistake.
*   They advise viewers *not* to do the same with the speaker's concepts.
*   Instead, viewers should:
    *   Find their own model.
    *   Determine their trading style (swing, short-term, day trading, intraday, scalping).
    *   Focus on a specific asset (futures, index futures, currencies/Forex, crypto).
*   The speaker has no affinity for cryptocurrency and believes Bitcoin is going to zero; therefore, it will not be discussed.
*   The speaker shifts focus to using levels from core content for day trading (referencing a specific module month on their YouTube channel, but unable to recall the exact month).
*   If the speaker is bullish, they look for the market to create up-close candles and draw into a predetermined level.
*   On the 14th, there was buy-side liquidity, and the speaker wanted to see price move up into unfinished business.
*   The 14th was the actionable day, using information shared live on the 13th.
*   From the open, price trades down into the high of the gap.
*   This isn't about supply and demand or trading back to a down-closed candle (order block).
*   The Fair Value Gap was permissible to the extent that price could trade down to half off (consequent encroachment) or the opening price of the down-closed candle.
*   The focus was on using the Fair Value Gap as support before any meaningful run higher could occur.
*   This signature needs to be present.
*   The initial movement down from the open is referred to as a **Judas Swing** (a fake move).
*   All of this occurred on Wednesday, the 14th.
*   The speaker addresses why they keep mistakenly referring to it as "Friday."
*   It's due to having "Friday Workshop" written in their notes, causing their subconscious to repeat it.
*   The live stream continues...

*   Mentions learning about **Larry Williams'** death and wondering if he ever resolved his uncertainty about buying below the opening price before large ranges.
*   Explains that Larry Williams was his first real mentor, learned from his books and VHS tapes.

Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining every detail, nuance, and the original tone while structuring it for better readability and comprehension:

# **Market Analysis: Pound/Dollar, NASDAQ, and News Event Considerations**

## **Pound/Dollar (Cable) Analysis: Unfinished Business and Liquidity**

*   The speaker refers to buy-side liquidity and previous discussions about the Pound/Dollar (Cable) potentially trading up into a specific area due to "unfinished business."
*   References teaching this in a prior stream.
*   Discussion about gradients
*   What levels are above this buy side
*   Explains that the levels can be found in a previous livestream.
*   Notes the "gradient levels":
    *   The low end of a fair value gap (shaded area).
    *   The lower quarter gradient level of the entire range.
    *   Consequent encroachment (midpoint).
    *   **127.754**: A static, finite number.
*   Advises factoring in spread when targeting this level for partial profit-taking, deducting the typical spread for the Pound/Dollar pair from the target.
*   Explores scenarios for holding over the weekend, *not* as an encouragement, but as a thought exercise.
*   Considers a potential scenario:
    *   The market makes a high, then gaps open higher on Sunday.
    *   It then trades down to fill the gap.
*   Reminds viewers this is how the speaker used to think about weekend holds when trading positions from Friday's close into Sunday's opening.
*   Emphasizes the continued exposure of inefficiency on the weekly chart.
*   Explains that all the movement from high to low in the shaded area was one weekly candle going down, creating an inefficiency that price is now addressing on the upside.
*   Stresses the importance of revisiting the weekly chart section of the video to understand the explanation of inefficiencies.
*   Highlights the benefit of having higher timeframe annotations on weekly charts and displaying them on all timeframes, to avoid surprises.

*   The London Open Killzone Starts at 2:00 AM and runs until 5:00 AM (local time).
*   Describes a gap up followed by a rally.
*   Points to the bodies of candles respecting the low of the weekly imbalance (fair value gap).
*   Highlights this respect as a significant signature.
*   Stresses the importance of higher timeframe weekly and daily inefficiencies, defining them as "real" support and resistance.
*   Discusses attempts to determine retail support and resistance levels, often unsuccessfully.
*   Explains the effort to bridge the gap between traders' expectations of support/resistance and what truly qualifies.
*   Identifies the highest degree of precision around inefficiencies.
*   Acknowledges that gaps and inefficiencies are commonly known but emphasizes holding onto them for months as the algorithm refers back to them.
*   Maintains a 60-day lookback on charts, referring to any old PD array (fair value gap, breaker, etc.) within that timeframe if relevant.
*   The relevant array must be in the proper context of what the speaker is looking for.
*   Restates the bearish outlook on the dollar from June 13th, anticipating the British pound trading up into the weekly chart's inefficiency due to "unfinished business."
*   Notes that the market energetically expanded upward.
*   Observed that it started on the 14th at the London session, then rallied.
*   Notes there is a wick.
*   Asks, "what is the wick doing here? damage."
*   Notes the wick trades down outside of the gap and goes to consequent encroachment, calling this a signature.
*   Asserts continued bullishness despite the move, explaining it doesn't change their mind or cause concern.
*   Refers to the downward excursion outside the shaded area as a "Mohawk."
*   Explains the "Mohawk" analogy: when mowing the lawn and distracted, accidentally cutting too far and leaving a small strip of uncut grass.
*   This "Mohawk" in price action is permissible within price delivery.
*   Points out the proximity of candle bodies to the shaded area, indicating it is permissible.
*   Considers it "no problem" even with a close approach to the low due to the wick's damage and return to the fair value gap at consequent encroachment.
*   Describes watching this area without trading, anticipating retail traders seeing a bear flag and expecting a drop, which is referred to as a "fake" bear flag.
*   Whenever doing examples and talking about what retail traders see, it's in relationship to what he is showing in order flow.
*   Uses no Level 2 or Market depth data.
*   Relies on reading inefficiencies and liquidity from higher timeframes transposed to lower timeframes.
*   Maintains the premise that a lower dollar equates to risk-on sentiment, allowing stock indices and Forex pairs to move higher.
*   Notes the Thursday two o'clock (AM) trading at the low of the weekly inefficiency/gap.
*   The market begins to rally and take off.

## **Refining the Analysis: 15-Minute Timeframe and Order Blocks**

*   Drops into a 15-minute timeframe for more granular detail.
*   The weekly inefficiencies and fair value gaps have been refined.
*   Notes consequent encroachment on the 15-minute chart.
*   Market treats right at that point.
*   Short term high is broken which indicates a shift in market structure at the low of the weekly inefficiency and fair value gap.
*   Poses the question "Is there a gap?"
*   Identifies the lowest down close candle.
*   Addresses why only using one candle.
*   Emphasizes that the candle is outside of the shaded area, and so it should be used.
*   States that you want to see the price repel.
*   Observes that it does repel price, which is the key.
*   You can take this entire range now for entry.
*   Explains that the lowest down close candle is used for support, indicating institutional sponsorship and continuous work off that level.
*   The speaker states that they already hear the people hissing.
*   Reclaimed order block:
    *   Down close candles are being reclaimed.
    *   The opens and closes are supportive.
*   Observes one more wick through it, stating "the wicks do the damage."
*   Advises against rushing a stop loss.
*   The market breaks above and clears buy-side liquidity.
*   Points out a small remaining range.
*   Ultimately aims for the previously defined target, deeming it "perfect delivery" if reached.
*   Doesn't need to see if it is going to happen today, as not trading.
*   Reminds viewers of having identified it on June 13th.

## **NASDAQ Analysis and CPI Considerations**

*   Transitions to NASDAQ analysis, referencing a trade executed on a cell phone yesterday.
*   The speaker apologizes for not recording the entire process.
*   The speaker was being taught how to use setups and did not want to worry about the setup.
*   Mentions the speaker's wife was present for at least a portion of the stream.
*   On June 13th, ahead of the CPI number.
*   The speaker generally is not accurate ahead of the CPI number.
*   Highlights that this accuracy is a rare occurrence publicly.
*   Reminds students *not* to trade ahead of CPI due to the high degree of risk.
*   Frames attempts to predict CPI as gambling, including their own.
*   The speaker sets parameters up like on the 13th, where they shared where the buy side and sell side were.
*   And a fair value gap
*   As each was traded, they told you what would be delivered to next.
*   Favored how it went down into the sell side quickly.
*   It went for the buy side quickly.
*   Then was followed by a pull back into the middle and the consequent encroachment of the range.
*   Allows for potential sell-side wipeout due to CPI as a classic FMC type thing.
*   States daily liquidity can clearly be seen being relatively equal, which indicates a lot of sell stops resting.
*   CPI could potentially use that as a smoke screen.
*   The market could use that smoke screen to drop down and clear out all the sell side, just on a wick.
*   That is a reason to be cautious.
*   Admits being wrong about expectations for Nasdaq ahead of CPI, reinforcing why it is important not to trade ahead of news events.
*   There are so many variables that could take place.
*   Explains that nobody really knows what it is going to do when these events happen.
*   If you didn't see it live, it's in the recording.
*   The movement is moving and traversing so fast that there is no way you are getting filled.
*   Brokers pull liquidity, as they are not allowed to trade that due to opening them up to unnecessary risk.
*   They claim there is an absence of liquidity; traders are not willing to trade it.
*   There are a lot of people trying to gamble, but Brokers don't want to get booked with an over-leveraged trade.
*   B booking is when a broker trades against you, but if you learn how to trade well you don't need to worry about that.
*   Highlights the muted downside movement and continued upward trajectory.

## **60-Minute Chart Analysis and News Driver Characteristics**

*   Drops into a 60 Minute chart.
*   Explains how this type of move, FMC, CPI, non-farm payroll all have a characteristic of those types of news drivers.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining every detail, nuance, and the original tone while structuring it for better readability and comprehension:

# **Market Analysis: News Drivers, Trading Psychology, and NASDAQ**

## **Understanding News Drivers and Market Sentiment**

*   **High Impact News Drivers:**
    *   The speaker expects the "worst-case scenario" regarding retail traders' positions.
    *   This expectation applies generally, not just to the current market.
    *   If the market has been trending upwards, most long positions should be in profit.
    *   The speaker anticipates the news driver will either reverse the market against these positions *or* trigger trailed stop losses, using them as a counterparty before continuing the uptrend.
    *   The primary goal is to "unseat" profitable positions before resuming the existing trend.
    *   Reversals are only confirmed at the time of price delivery.
    *   Examples of news events: **CPI**, **FOMC**, and **Non-Farm Payroll.**

## **ICT MythBusters: Clarifying Trading Rules**

*   **Mondays:**
    *   The speaker clarifies that they advise *new* students *not* to trade on Mondays to observe market behavior.
    *   Experienced traders can trade Mondays.
    *   The goal is for new students to use the information they get.

*   **Non-Farm Payroll:**
    *   New students should *not* trade *during* the Non-Farm Payroll release.
    *   Trading is possible *after* the release (approximately 30 minutes) by capitalizing on gaps, inefficiencies, and liquidity.
    *   The challenge for new traders is a lack of confidence and consistency *during* the event.
    *   The purpose is to guide new students away from potentially harmful situations.

## **CPI and the Realities of High-Impact News Events**

*   **CPI Warnings:**
    *   The speaker uses vivid language to describe the potential consequences of being wrong during CPI releases, emphasizing the violent and unforgiving nature of the market at these times.
    *   Brokers are *not* lenient; worst-case fills are common.
    *   Stop losses may be ineffective due to extreme volatility and lack of liquidity.
    *   The resulting fill price can be the "most ill position."
    *   The speaker emphasizes avoiding these painful experiences, wishing someone had given them similar guidance earlier in their career.
    *   New students can develop overconfidence and believe they have "cracked the algorithm," only to be humbled by a losing trade during a news event.
    *   The speaker admits to making the same mistakes, attempting to "outperform" their own algorithm due to human error.

## **Trading Rules and Frameworks**

*   **Importance of Rigid Rules:**
    *   The speaker emphasizes the importance of simple, rigid rules to maintain discipline.
    *   Example of a simple rule: Look for a specific level to act as a premium, distributing price lower to a discount.
    *   Time is also a critical factor.
    *   The speaker provides a framework that requires patience and specific times.
    *   In stock indices, the morning session runs from 8:30 AM to 11:00 AM.
    *   New traders should *not* trade during the lunchtime hour.
    *   New traders should focus on one good setup per week.

## **Avoiding Overconfidence and "Drunken" Trading**

*   **The Dangers of Winning:**
    *   The speaker cautions against becoming "drunk on winning," which leads to overtrading and giving back profits.
    *   It's easy to feel like you can get in there again.
    *   The speaker says that it can lead to traders getting mad at themselves and at the speaker.
    *   It emphasizes listening to the "dry points" and "boring parts" of lectures to stay disciplined.
    *   The speaker is highlighting the need for discipline and adherence to the rules.

## **NASDAQ Analysis: Hourly Chart and Price Action**

*   **Hourly Chart Analysis:**
    *   The analysis begins at 8:00 AM.
    *   The speaker identifies a "big wick" on the hourly chart.
    *   The discussion involves "body to low" and gradients.
    *   Reference to gradients is used to analyze price movement.

*   **Wicks/Tails and Gaps:**
    *   The speaker treats wicks and tails similarly to gaps, with the algorithm referencing these areas as inefficiencies.
    *   The midpoint of a wick/tail is considered "consequent encroachment."

*   **Maintaining Bullishness:**
    *   For bullish continuation, price should *not* close below the consequent encroachment level (15,054.5).
    *   The ideal scenario is price action from the high of the wick/tail down to consequent encroachment.
    *   The bodies of candles respecting the upper quadrant of the wick/tail range is a positive sign.

*   **Reading Price Action:**
    *   When reading price action live, the speaker is "eyeballing" and "roughing it."
    *   Observing whether candle bodies stop at or near the upper quarter or half of the wick/tail range is crucial.
    *   A candle body moving into the 50% level (consequent encroachment) is a warning sign of potential weakness.
    *   The speaker considers the "willingness" of bodies to close and/or open at the upper quadrant, avoiding revisits to the lower quadrant.

## **Balanced Price Range (BPR)**

*   **Definition and Characteristics:**
    *   A balanced price range occurs when a market has delivered both upside and downside within a defined range.
    *   The speaker contrasts this with a "key reversal" or "island reversal" from older trading methods, where price gaps create separation.
    *   A BPR is essentially that element of separation.
    *   An extreme low is reached, followed by a large candle and then a return "all the way back over top of that again".
    *   It involves a "single pass down, single pass up".

*   **Range Definition:**
    *   The BPR is defined by the highest and lowest extremes between the up-close and down-close candles.

*   **Equilibrium and Algorithmic Significance:**
    *   Bodies of candles often respect the midpoint of the balanced price range.
    *   The speaker asserts this concept is *not* taught in retail trading and is based on his own "authorship."
    *   When the speaker refers to a balanced price range, there is a defined boundary beyond which a candle's body should *not* breach.
    *   In the current example, the speaker looks for a lower dollar movement, which equates to "risk-on" sentiment (higher foreign currencies and stock indices).
    *   The speaker knows that The dollar Index and index Futures are not locked step.

*   **Limitations and Wicks:**
    *   The speaker codes in a limitation of how far the Market's going to go.
    *   Wicks are permitted to do a certain measure of damage.
    *   The speaker emphasizes that candlestick patterns are supporting the principle he is teaching.

*   **Equilibrium and Order Flow:**
    *   A balanced price range represents a return to equilibrium (not consequent encroachment or mean threshold).
    *   The speaker wants to see the market move up, then create more power.
    *   Ideal order flow: open down close rally close on the high.
    *   The question at that time is "is it bullish or is it bearish".


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining every detail, nuance, and the original tone while structuring it for better readability and comprehension:

# **Advanced Fair Value Gap Analysis, Balanced Price Ranges, and Breakaway Gaps**

## **Identifying Bullish Opportunities: Utilizing the 15-Minute Chart and Power Three**

*   **Setup:**
    *   The speaker identifies a bullish setup on a 15-minute candlestick chart.
    *   The bullish condition is recognized "right here, right here, okay on this candle's close."
*   **Power Three Application:**
    *   The very next candle, on a 15-minute basis, can be analyzed using the **Power Three** concept.
    *   As the candle opens and drops down, buying opportunities exist "anywhere in the upper 50%" of that candle's range.
*   **Expectation of Range Preservation:**
    *   The expectation is that this range will "stay open."
*   **Rationale:**
    *   This expectation stems from a similar pattern occurring earlier in the chart, but with more candles in between.
    *   The speaker refers to this as "time distortion."
*   **Addressing Potential Frustration:**
    *   The speaker acknowledges that this level of analysis may be complicated for some viewers.
    *   He understands some may prefer a simpler approach, like using a moving average.
*   **Transparency in Methodology:**
    *   The speaker emphasizes that he's teaching "how I do these things," specifically how he determines when live executions will be successful.
    *   He states, "I say this is going to stay open, it's optimal for this fair value, you have to stay open."
*   **Compression Analogy:**
    *   To simplify the concept, the speaker asks the listener to "imagine this one candle" representing the compressed price action of multiple candles.

## **Comparative Analysis: Identifying Lower Fair Value Gaps**

*   **Comparative lows:**
    *   The speaker prompts a comparison: "Which is higher, this low or this low?"
    *   The lower low serves as a reference point, but the speaker advises against anchoring to it.
*   **Comparative highs:**
    *   Another comparison: "Which is lower, the high of this candle or the high of this candle?"
    *   The speaker removes a visual obstruction ("the dog") to improve clarity.
*   **Reference points:**
    *   The identified low and high serve as reference points.
*   **Expansion for Encapsulation:**
    *   Similar to the **Balanced Price Range (BPR)** concept, the speaker aims for "full encapsulation."
    *   The goal is to define a **Fair Value Gap (FVG)** that is "lower than this one."
*   **Degree of distinction:**
    *   The degree to which it is lower is that candle.
*   **Visual Representation:**
    *   The speaker describes mapping out the FVGs, using the higher high and dragging it down.
*   **BPR should never:**
    *   All of this is a balanced price range it should never come back down and through the midpoint of that meaning there would be a small portion of this Gap left open.

## **Overlapping Fair Value Gaps and the Island Reversal**

*   **Playing Devil's Advocate:**
    *   The speaker considers a scenario where price moves down into the defined range.
    *   Even in this case, he wouldn't be concerned about a complete closure.
*   **Overlapping Gaps:**
    *   The reason for this lack of concern is the presence of overlapping FVGs in that range.
    *   The speaker notes, "we have this fair value gap in this river you got that basically overlap in this range right there."
*   **Island Reversal Formation:**
    *   This overlapping creates "an island reversal," characterized by "multiple candles that are segregated from all the movement here and here."
*   **Manipulation Perspective:**
    *   The speaker internalizes all of this action as "manipulation."
    *   The purpose is to offset existing liquidity.

## **Liquidity, Smart Money, and the Market Rally**

*   **Offsetting Existing Liquidity:**
    *   The speaker says the purpose of manipulation is "to offset existing liquidity for the purposes of anyone that would be profitable once we get above this high."
*   **Smart Money Acquisition:**
    *   The speaker continues that if the market spends time down there to allow offset longs to be taken out and who would assume that position if they're getting knocked out, that will be smart money.
*   **Anticipating the Rally:**
    *   The market rally is expected upon.
*   **The BPR Caveat:**
    *   The speaker admits that BPRs "are going to be requiring a lot of education, a lot of teaching."
    *   He preemptively acknowledges that some viewers may find it unnecessary: "I promise you that you don't need it."

## **Transparency in Identifying Fair Value Gaps**

*   **Demand for Knowledge:**
    *   The speaker reminds the audience that he's sharing this advanced concept because they asked him "to tell you how I know certain fair value gaps are going to stay open."
    *   He emphasizes his transparency: "I'm not hiding it from you, I'm telling you these, this is it, this is what I'm doing to do that."
*   **Principles and Concepts:**
    *   The speaker emphasizes that these are "all principles and concepts that I'm using to implement to determine when fair value gaps are going to stay up."

## **Live Execution Examples and Breakaway Gaps**

*   **Real-Time Trading Demonstrations:**
    *   The speaker references numerous live trading examples where he executes trades, manages stops, takes partials, and hits targets.
    *   He notes that many of these examples are shared on Twitter with music overlays.
*   **Compressed Execution Videos:**
    *   The speaker mentions the use of compressed videos (two minutes or less) on Twitter to showcase his execution process.
*   **Fair Value Gap Functions:**
    *   The speaker identifies two primary functions for FVGs: acting as a breakaway gap.
*   **Optimal Scenario for Breakaway Gaps:**
    *   For a breakaway gap, "it should not close fully," meaning "it's the best-case scenario to see this stay open."

## **The Significance of Balanced Price Ranges in Breakaway Gaps**

*   **Application to Specific Gaps:**
    *   The speaker applies this principle to a specific gap, stating, "I would say that about this one regardless because it would be treated as a breakaway gap."
*   **Balanced Price Range Confirmation:**
    *   The reason for this classification is the presence of a balanced price range, indicating that the market is "in equilibrium."
*   **Body Support of Equilibrium:**
    *   He notes that "the body's supporting that idea is seen here."
*   **Anticipating Price Movement:**
    *   Following the equilibrium, price moves, leading to "this big extrapolation but yet to take out this high."
*   **Liquidity and the Draw:**
    *   The speaker identifies this untapped high as the "draw," indicating where price is likely to move to capture existing "buy-side" liquidity.
*   **Swift Gap Movement:**
    *   He also notes that "this Gap is moving quickly away from all this consolidation around equilibrium based on that balanced price range."

## **Advanced Concepts and Continued Education**

*   **Acknowledging Complexity:**
    *   The speaker recognizes that these concepts are complex and may be overwhelming for some viewers.
    *   He uses the phrase "some of your heads are swirling right now like what the hell is he talking about?"
*   **Commitment to Education:**
    *   Despite the complexity, he commits to continuous education: "example after example, spend time with me, every time there's a balanced price range I will bring your attention to it."
*   **Multi-Platform Reinforcement:**
    *   He reinforces these concepts across multiple platforms: "I do it in live executions, I talk about it in advance, I talk about it in tweets, I talk about it in reviews."
*   **Exposure and Understanding:**
    *   The goal is to increase exposure and understanding through repeated examples.

## **Breakaway Gaps Defined and PD Array Matrix**

*   **Breakaway Gap Definition:**
    *   He proceeds to define a breakaway gap, stating that it is "expected to form when for instance say we're bullish on the market and you have identified a key level that would support us or be presented as support and that is acting as a discount array."
*   **Balanced Price Range at Equilibrium:**
    *   The key level identified in the definition is "balanced price range at equilibrium."
*   **Beyond the Core Content:**
    *   The speaker states that balanced price range is "one of the PD arrays that is not taught in the mentorship core content where I show you the pdre Matrix."
*   **Location Flexibility:**
    *   A balanced price range "can exist in any place in a discount or a premium," unlike the PD arrays in the matrix, which "nest in that order."
*   **Event Horizon Similarities:**
    *   The speaker compares the BPR to "Event Horizon," noting that both can exist anywhere within the discount/premium spectrum.

## **Guidance for New Traders and Overcoming Overwhelm**

*   **Addressing New Viewers:**
    *   The speaker acknowledges that these concepts may be overwhelming for new viewers: "if you're brand new that just completely win over your head."
*   **Focus on Core Content:**
    *   He advises them to "dig into the the content and it's there," and to avoid trying to learn everything at once.
*   **Necessity of BPRs:**
    *   He reiterates that understanding BPRs is not essential for profitability: "you don't need to know a fair value Gap that stays open, you don't need that to be profitable."
*   **Sharing Knowledge:**
    *   However, he's making the information available to those who "want to know everything that I'm willing to share."

## **Fair Value Gaps and Order Flow Confirmation**

*   **Absence of Gaps:**
    *   Even without the BPR, if a move "creates the Fairway Gap," notice there are no gaps through the close of the gap and new candle formed.
    *   This indicates "efficiently delivered" price action.
*   **Extrapolation and Liquidity:**
    *   The speaker continues that there is this big extrapolation of The Upside, so this Gap here even if this wasn't here as a fair value got this Gap that's shaded here, the draw on that is liquidity.

## **Treating Breakaway Gaps and Timeframe Considerations**

*   **Breakaway Gap Classification:**
    *   He would "treat that regardless of the gap on the other side here whether that's there or not this is classified to me as a breakaway cap."
*   **Closure Expectations:**
    *   For a breakaway gap, "I don't want to see it completely close in, it can come back down to half of it."
    *   However, with a BPR present, he wouldn't want to see even half of it traded through.
*   **Remaining Open:**
    *   Thus, he would prefer for it to "remain open," considering it "optimal for this to remain open."
*   **Overlapping Highs:**
    *   The speaker points out that the very next candle here the same thing you would expect it to do what you can see it open and then the previous candles High over here overlapping this one that would be otherwise a fair value Gap if this would make the low as low as it did here this low completely returns back to debt the candle's High.
*   **Multiple Timeframe Perspective:**
    *   The speaker reveals that he's "looking at other time frames," particularly when viewing one-minute or three-minute charts.
*   **Trusting Order Flow:**
    *   This multi-timeframe perspective helps him "trust that the order flow is being supported by every candlestick."
*   **Absence of Indicators:**
    *   The speaker emphasizes that "there's no trend line required, there's no moving average required, there's no v-wop required, nothing, it's pure price, just pure price."
*   **Balanced Price Range within Equal Highs:**
    *   The speaker discusses balanced price range with overlapping equal highs.
*   **Exploration of By-Side Liquidity:**
    *   He emphasizes that it is more likely to explore buy side that's existing where would that be above here and keep pressing higher.

## **The Intersection of Understanding and Opportunity**

*   **Divergence of Paths:**
    *   The speaker acknowledges a point of divergence: "this is where we depart, where you're like okay this is too much, I'm not interested."
*   **Honest Self-Assessment:**
    *   He encourages viewers to be honest about their level of interest and understanding.
*   **Hindsight Perspective:**
    *   The speaker admits that there will be conjectures it is hindsight.
*   **Continuous Learning:**
    *   He acknowledges "the things the same things that I'm looking at are continuous discount or premium inefficiency or liquidity."
*   **Adaption and Mastery:**
    *   He emphasizes that the only separation from those things for analysis purposes is the relationship to the balance price range or the lack of a balanced price range.

## **Power Three**

*   **Power three:**
    *   Speaker references the Power Three and his teachings of buying at the opening price in a bullish market.
*   **Discounted Premium:**
    *   He got the idea of stripping down the market and looking for discounted premium the opening price when it's bullish.

## **Larry Williams**

*   **Speaker references Larry Williams:**
    *   Speaker references Larry Williams's comments and idea, but also shares his experience of his style did not work for him.
*   **Trust in Teachers:**
    *   Speaker speaks of the trust and love he had for Mr. Williams in the past.
*   **Individual Application:**
    *   The speaker recommends doing due diligence and back testing and seeing what one of these PD arrays that makes sense to you.
*   **Fanfare:**
    *   It's like the the Fanfare that comes around somebody that you have a lot of affinity for but don't do that with my Concepts you know.

## **Model Building and Profitability**

*   **Model Building:**
    *   The most of you are going to determine your model is linked to that In Bloom where you're planted don't try to Tinker with it too much.
*   **Repeat Risk Reward:**
    *   All you're trying to do is find something that separates from where the market is right now where it's likely to go and measure risk that you can afford to take as a loss and then you repeat that over and over again and that's profitability.
*   **Consistent Continuity:**
    *   That's consistency that's continuity which brings longevity you don't want to be a one-hit wonder get a five figure withdrawal from a funded account say hell yeah I'm balling here that's not that's not success that's what everybody's treating it like right now they want to get funded and get a lottery win.
*   **Lottery Trader:**
    *   He emphasizes that he is not teaching how to be a lottery Trader he is teaching how to be long-term consistently profitable Trader.
*   **Best thing:**
    *   Some of you think you can make it happen like that it doesn't work like that it doesn't because you're going to bring in all kinds of things that you have to wrestle with then you're gonna you're gonna swear up and down that you know something I'm gonna teach or talk or will teach is the replacement for what you think is the the best thing.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining every detail, nuance, and the original tone while structuring it for better readability and comprehension:

# **Advanced Trading Concepts: Model Perseverance, Silver Bullets, and Intermarket Analysis**

## **Sticking to Your Model and Trusting Evidence**

*   **Avoid Overthinking New Concepts:** "Every time I bring something new, you're going to question the thing that may be showing you evidence that this is your model right now."
*   **Do Not Abandon Success:** "Wherever you start seeing success, even in the early stages, don't abandon that."
*   **Time and Foundation:** "You have to give yourself time, and you have to stick with something long enough to know that you have a foundation in it."
*   **Interconnected PD Arrays:** "You're going to see that all these PD arrays lean and lean on one another; it's like a web that all it's a whole entire structure."
*   **Holistic Price View:** "When I look at Price, I'm seeing all of it at one time."
*   **Waiting for Manifestation:** "Some of the things I want to see, I have to wait to see if they're going to manifest, and that's usually on the heel end or backside of a high impact or medium impact news driver."

## **ICT Silver Bullet: A Deep Dive**

*   **Chart Setup:** The speaker shifts focus to a five-minute chart to illustrate the **ICT Silver Bullet** concept.
*   **Elements Present:** "We have all the balanced price range equilibrium, we have the Breakaway Gap, we traded above, we have a down closed candle."
*   **Identifying the Bullish Order Block:** "So what is this? What's this down close candle? Bull shoulder block."
*   **Fair Value Gap Confirmation:** "Does it have a fair value Gap right there?"
*   **Timing is Crucial:**
    *   **Time of Day:** "What time of day is that? 10:05."
    *   **AM Session:** "That's your am session Silver Bullet."
*   **Trading the Gap:** "You can trade this Gap right here, which would be encapsulated here."
*   **Timeframe for ICT Silver Bullet:**
    *   If trading within the 10 AM to 11 AM hour, start from a 15-minute chart.
    *   Refine the search by going down to 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1-minute charts.
    *   For adamant searches, "drop down into the seconds charts if you're adamant about finding one it will be there it will absolutely be there."

## **The Rationale Behind Silver Bullets**

*   **Partial Profits Always Pay:** "Here's the why behind a solar bullet okay there is always folks just like a partial profit pays every time it's a hundred percent profitable when you take a partial profit it never fails to pay you that's why I teach you to do it you're always winning taking a partial."
*   **Always Winning with Partial Profits:** "It never ever ever fails to put more money in your account."
*   **Addressing Skeptics:** The speaker addresses critics who consider taking partial profits as foolish due to incurring initial risk for smaller gains.
*   **Uncertainty in the Market:** "You don't know if that Market's gonna go there Yahoo and you as a new developing student you have no idea is going to do that either so when it gives you the opportunity to take money out you do it any over time doing that you learn more about yourself you learn more to trust."
*   **Gradual Expansion and Comfort Zone:** "Let me just take a small portion and move myself to break even and graduate in my experience and seeing what it feels like to go into these scary moments but still taking profits."
*   **No Overnight Success:** "Nobody no Buck Rogers jumped out there and said I know how to trade this is the model I'm going to do and it's full bore full pool no partials and I'm doing it all the time that's an okay that's an that tells you that and it's an that's telling you to trade like that."
*   **Unpredictable Market Intervention:** "You don't know when these markets are going to have manual intervention you have no idea when it's going to turn on you nobody does that if I didn't if I didn't have the respect of the risk that's available in these markets I wouldn't use a stop loss and I'm the guy teaching you I'm telling you."
*   **Importance of Stop Losses:**
    *   The speaker emphasizes his concern when students send screenshots of open trades without stop losses.
    *   He deems it as "gambling" to assume being always right.
    *   "I'm cringing because you're not using a stop loss that means you're gambling you you assume that you're absolutely right there's no way you can be wrong and I don't even think that I authored all this and I still have to use a stop loss because you don't know when chaos is going to show up you don't know when uncertainty enters the chat some unexpected event some bomb drops somewhere someone declares w-a-r-u paying attention."

## **Why Silver Bullets Work: Displacement and Market Dynamics**

*   **The Core Principle:** "So why do silver bullets work why will they form because there's always going to be displacement between 10 o'clock and 11."
*   **Key Note-Taking Time:** "Why this is the part where you take notes folks okay in the hour of 10 o'clock and 11 o'clock in the morning New York local time what has happened already The Market opens at 9 30. they're opening bell."
*   **Market Open Dynamics:**
    *   The market opens at 9:30 AM EST.
    *   Initial reactions involve retail traders ("John Q public") reacting to opening prices.
    *   "I mean we've been trading all night long but the opening bell happens ding ding ding everybody's now paying attention everybody's clapping their hands I've never understood what the they're clapping for but the bottom line is is that the Market's open 9 30 bills of ring now everybody's rushing out there to buy and sell stocks great retail trader John Q public is watching the ticker tape and he's saying okay my stock opened up two dollars more where it closed yesterday this is amazing I'm making money well that Gap is going to close likely and then it drops down then after that Gap fills if it fills at all then there's new sentiment that shifts."
*   **Gap Theory and Sentiment Shift:**
    *   Opening gaps tend to close.
    *   Post-gap-fill, market sentiment shifts, leading to potential continuations or reversals.
    *   "Okay it either overlaps that Gap and breaks down then it treats the low of the Gap as resistance and keeps going lower or it fills the Gap rallies up treats the higher the Gap is support and then continuously moves higher there's your Gap Theory right there use that with new week opening Gap new day opening Gap any Gap any fair value Gap any real liquidity void that's how you treat it now what separates the support behind that Gap is the consequent culture in the midpoint how we trade there at time of day."
*   **Consequent Culture and Midpoint Significance:** "How we trade there at time of day."
*   **The 30-Minute Window:**
    *   By 10:00 AM, 30 minutes have passed since the opening bell.
    *   "At 10 o'clock we have 30 minutes behind us which is why I tell you the 30 minute opening range that's important every every algorithm uses that first 30 minutes every one of them they use that to refine a very specific range to look for inefficiencies and allow sometimes liquidity to form below or above it and they'll do another path go back below take stops out and then run through or don't return back into it at all but just half of it and then it runs higher or lower in deference to whatever the bias would be for that day but the main takeaway is at 10 o'clock you have 30 minutes of trading after the opening bell so that initial flurry of rush to do something John Q public is doing their trading then and they're usually apt to be wrong."
*   **Algorithm Refinement:** Algorithms refine a specific range, seeking inefficiencies and liquidity above/below it.
*   **Waiting for Clarity:** Traders should avoid pre-emptive biases and wait for price delivery between 9:30 AM and 10:00 AM.
    *   "So we allow for that to take place we don't have any bias ahead of time okay we don't care and we wait and see where price delivers from 9 30 to 10 o'clock now at 10 o'clock we refer to where we think price is going to go anyway where we've been calling price for."

## **Drawing Liquidity and Market Bias**

*   **NASDAQ Analysis:** The speaker uses the continuous contract for NASDAQ to gain a higher timeframe perspective.
*   **Buy Side Liquidity:** Identified as a potential drawing point.
*   **Order Block Reference:** The speaker points to an order block, using a lower one due to "lower hanging fruit objective."
    *   "NASDAQ I'm going to use the continuous contractors to get a higher time frame perspective okay buy side liquidity here [Music] there and we have a order block there why this one Michael this one stretches down it's relatively equal lows also I'm using that as a reference point you wouldn't be wrong by saying this one okay I'm just using it because it's lower so it's a lower hanging fruit objective it doesn't mean it's going to go there it just means that that's how I would look at it like that."
*   **Focus on ES and NQ:** Focus remains on ES and NQ with emphasis on their respective relationships.
*   **Trading Bias Confirmation:**
    *   "So if we have this by side liquidity here as a potential drawing liquidity and then drop down into that with Tony Green we're on was it 15 minutes right yes we have this as a buy solid liquidity and go back into what we're looking for higher prices nonetheless lower dollar risk on your dot higher pound dollar higher and equities are permitted to trade higher our Focus was on ES that's the one I've been teaching through there was an on filled or re traded to uh weekly imbalance of volume and balance on the e-mini s p NASDAQ has been the upside performer so even though NASDAQ has already moved up you could take trades in the ES but if you're trying to take a trade like if you want to use relative strength analysis and you want to do longs the one you want to be trading is the one that's showing the outperformance on the upside which has been clearly the leader in Tech so NASDAQ is in the upside leader BS will follow in suit by sympathy."
*   **Sympathetic Price Action:** NASDAQ's outperformance can lead to ES following suit.
*   **June Contract Reference:** For clarity, the speaker uses the June contract to highlight inefficiencies.
*   **ES and NQ Inefficiencies:**
    *   NASDAQ has already worked inside its inefficiency.
    *   ES has yet to trade up into its inefficiency, suggesting more upside potential.
    *   "Okay so here's the NASDAQ remember I told you there's the inefficiency we've already worked inside that one if we look at it from the perspective of the ES we only went to this high and we have yet to trade up into this inefficiency so in my opinion you know we have much more room to go up on the outside now if you take that insight and you add it to the new front month based on the volume we have this here okay so that's the this is the month that we're trading in for ES and then we add it to NQ again we can't pull that out because of the the data is not being there so I'm referring that to the previous month that will be expiring knowing that we're likely to continue but I fall away from the analysis from NASDAQ and we're like more so on the es because es should move sympathetically higher to try to catch up that's the theory of Six Sisters."

## **Six Sisters Theory and Market Leadership**

*   **NASDAQ as Leader:** NASDAQ is identified as the leader among the "Six Sisters."
*   **ES Catching Up:** ES is expected to move sympathetically to catch up with NASDAQ.
*   **Possible Scenario:** Potential consolidation or lack of leadership in NASDAQ, followed by a bigger move in ES.
    *   "So we may see in the future a uh a consolidation or a lack of leadership on NASDAQ and then more upside offered on a bigger day move on like ES it might not happen but that's how I treat the six sister so as long as the leadership issue goes higher which is NASDAQ that should pull up looking for instance all boats rise in high tide that's the that's the moniker I'm using here this everything goes up when the tie goes up."
*   **Dow's Lagging Performance:** The Dow is described as lethargic and not joining the market rally.

## **Historical Analysis and Market Expectations**

*   **CPI Commentary Reference:** The speaker references a live stream on June 13th where he discussed the potential impact of the CPI number.
*   **Anticipated Sell-Side Liquidity:** He anticipated the CPI number potentially causing a sell-off to take out stops before resuming the rally.
*   **ES and NASDAQ Similarity:** Similar expectations for ES.
*   **Specific Liquidity Target:** At 18 minutes and 49 seconds of the live stream, he identified 39,628 as the draw on liquidity for ES.
*   **Dow as a Barometer:** The speaker uses the Dow as a barometer, similar to how he uses the Dollar Index.
    *   "But if you contrast that with with the the Dow is doing this thing's lethargic it just doesn't want to join the party at all but we were able to see it in a while our Run Tour High here on NASDAQ I told you I was waiting for CPI on the June 13th live stream um I was aware that the CPI number could potentially cause a big dive lower for the person to sell side but it would just be the purpose of taking out stops and then resume that was the whole premise when I talked about NASDAQ you can go and watch live stream that's there in the commentary and it was a similar idea with es it was probably wait and see the only thing I was definitive on on stock indices at the time of that live stream uh at the 18 minute and 49 second time period I pulled up this chart here and I said that 39 628 would be the Drone liquidity which is in the first High and that's where we saw it draw up into and it stopped pretty much right after that retrace lower and now we're piercing it again um I don't trade the Dow I use it as a barometer like I use the dollar Index so I'm looking at the relationships between the three averages."

## **Dow Theory and Market Confirmation**

*   **Confirming Averages:** Averages should confirm one another, a concept derived from Dow Theory.
    *   "So if this is typically you understood as Dow Theory which I think in obviously using stock indices it works it's a proven method and it's comparing the averages they should confirm one another and I'll show you what I mean by that let's pull up the es chart and we'll pull it up on a."
*   **ES Target:** The speaker anticipates ES reaching 4500 or just below it.
    *   "This is what I'm thinking we're going to reach up to so that way we know if in case I lose track of what I'm saying I think es is going to pull up into 4500 or just below it so there you go you have an expectation of what I think we're reaching for I know someone's reached out and told me that Larry Williams is calling for you know retracement or moving lower I don't see that happening until we get up to here for at least yes and I'm happy to be wrong to you know against his analysis but you know I'm sharing what what I think."

## **Multi-Timeframe Analysis and SMT Divergence**

*   **15-Minute Chart as Bellwether:**
    *   The speaker considers the 15-minute chart as a crucial timeframe.
    *   "All right here's a 60 Minute chart and I still want a 15 minute chart I failed to mention earlier a 15-minute chart is a Bellwether chart like it's to me like if I was forced to do anything less than a a daily chart and I couldn't do anything below a daily chart and just use one time frame it would be the 15 minute chart like it gives you the best of the best in terms of short-term entries and targets because everything you can find on The Daily you'll see it on this if you compress enough you'll you'll have better refinement of those level levels too you can get short-term trades you can day trade you can scalp you can enter into long-term position trades it's the the it's the time frame it does all I'm not limited or satisfied with that because that's why like I go into lower lower time frames even sub one minute like in the seconds charts I don't advise the new people to do that because you can read into 15 and 5 and 10 and 30 second charts thinking you see something there that on an hourly chart is like Rocket Fuel and boom you know these things can move like 40 handles on something on a higher time frame basis on a news driver and you're thinking you're seeing a fair value gap on a 30 second 15 second you chart and get roasted all right so anyway."
*   **Dangers of Low Timeframes:** New traders are cautioned against relying on very low timeframes due to potential misinterpretations.
*   **Intermarket Analysis:** How to setup charts for intermarket analysis.
*   **Chart Overlay Method:** Speaker recommends against overlaying charts and plotting new pane for intermarket analysis instead.
    *   "Yes here on a 15 minute basis you click on this little thing up here for com compare and you're going to type in or find it in here but I'm going to show you how to do because assuming you don't have it on your chart yeah NQ u2023 if you do it like that it's going to plot it right over top of your chart I don't like that okay what I do is I go over here and I set it to and I know some of you are going to say well if you do this you do I know I know foreign candlesticks you can do it on a line basis but I'm going to show you the Candlestick version okay yeah I did it wrong I have it set up as a template I've been spoiling myself with it you can create little templates over here and we'll set this on new pane new pane puts it down below the price and you want to do it with a dow also and I don't see the Dow here so now if you're going to use it as a as a line chart since we're looking at lows okay this is how you back test you study it and get your screenshots of it if we're bullish and you're expecting it to see a rotation higher in some Divergence which would be smt diversion you're plotting on the low so you're comparing the relationship of the low of es or whatever when you're using this will be my trading instrument and then for Nasdaq I'm plotting this line chart on the basis of the close I'm sorry on the low rather and same thing with the the down you're going to do it on the well and then squeeze it up a little bit and you want to compare the low do we see a lower low here on the NASDAQ we do and it looks like we see a lower low on the Dow so there's no smt diversions there same thing here lower low respectively lower low respectively so if we see a time when there's a lower low in your trading instrument whether say you're trading es or you're trading NASDAQ when you compare the other averages against it if you're long or wanting to go long you want to plot this and if it gives you a Divergence it acts as a qualifier I can you can take and you will take trades without smt but when smt forms or Divergence against the averages or if you're using it against"
*   **SMT Divergence as a Qualifier:**
    *   SMT divergence against the averages serves as a qualifier.
    *   Trading is possible without SMT, but its presence improves confirmation.

# **Advanced Trading Concepts: SMT Divergence, Intermarket Analysis, Silver Bullets, and Gold Trading**

## **SMT Divergence and Correlated Pairs**

*   **Correlated Pair Examples:** "The uh the dollar against the Euro or the pound versus the URL which is a correlated pair smt that versions when you're looking at two closely correlated which is essentially what we're doing here it's this is a uh correlated pair smt but with index features if they were considered payers of correlated pair smt the versions would be euro dollar making a lower low while pound dollar makes a higher low when Dollar is bearish that would mean dollar goes lower and the one that makes the failed lower low that's the relative strength leader that was the one you would be going long in in either Euro or pound whichever one makes the the failed lower level."
*   **Measuring Price Action:** "So there's a lot of measuring that goes on when I'm watching price actions if you heard me many times mention I have a lot of monitors okay you don't need a lot of monitors but you need to be able to have at least two charts open that could be done on the laptop like I was showing you here earlier or it could be a secondary monitor you know in your system."
*   **Cell Phone Trading Limitations:** "It's very very difficult to trade on your cell phone okay it's not impossible I mean I've done it but you are literally looking through a very small window of what is going on and it's very easy to get fixated on whatever you're seeing in that small little four inch universe or whatever your instrument is or tablet or phone is you're missing out on a lot of information and the way I trade is I look at all these other things I'm showing you here today each monitor has its own real estate what it's responsible for What markets to follow what time frames I have on here all of those things I'm monitoring I'm constantly getting a new refreshed view of everything from the higher time frame down across a lot of markets that are closely correlated so I'm using inter-market relationships and intra Market relationships so that way there's a relationship between how markets are either positive correlated or inversely correlated and they should agree on the most part I'm allowing for this discrepancy or cracking correlation where it's expected to form."
*   **Identifying SMT Divergence:** "I do not look at charts okay this is very important I never look at charts for the purposes of finding an smt diversions look at the lows here we have a higher low here we have a higher low here but we have the lower low on Dow see that okay here that's a Divergence as SNT diversions I used to when I was younger when I was first dabbling into this I would only look for it to form and trade based on that and I had my hands handed to me it's only when you know where the Market's likely to draw to it creates a real measure of accumulation and distribution."
*   **Larry Williams and Accumulation/Distribution:** "Larry Williams has a accumulation distribution formula which when I first learned about it I fell in love with it and and for Commodities in uh you know higher time frame price moves four hour and daily I found that it was really good but eventually you know it's just didn't work as well as I wanted it to and didn't form enough but I was using it as a means of getting into some of my trades when I would look for something to go along the qualifying thing was the 50-day moving average would be bullish in other words it's sloping up and then I would look for an oversold condition on an hourly chart with a stochastic and the Williams percent are being oversold than the very next day I would look at the opening and as long as it dropped from the opening price damn I would chase that going into longs so I would be on there buying it buying it I would never want to go short I was afraid to short I didn't know him I didn't understand how to short so everything I did was primarily gone long so my model would be supercharged if I saw a accumulation distribution bullish Divergence."
*   **SMT Divergence is Not a Magic Bullet:** "So I don't want you thinking that it's a Magic Bullet okay where all you have to do is look for a Divergence and that's your entry because Divergence is as you saw earlier when I was showing you the euro dollar events against the dollar Index um there was a smt diversions at the time that would have been a qualifying thing for me to say I'm done and I wouldn't hold for the trade anymore but you watched the dollar rotate go lower and the euro dollar make it even higher high so I would have missed whatever that movements and if it's even going higher I don't know I haven't seen it since we talked about it but the just for the purpose of smt alone that Divergence does not mean anything coupled with profit taking when it meets the time of day where you should be trying to you know close up shop or at least try to get the majority of your trade in in real profit and not open profit where you actually take partials and now you're booking that profit that to me is more meaningful in the sense of using it or if it does form an entry with the smt diversion at the time of day and it fits the criteria and your drawing liquidity hasn't been reached or targeted has been reached for yet then then it's more meaningful to use it but being uh in and of itself it's useless okay it has to be used at the proper context and I see a lot of new folks that have just recently gone through some of my stuff they're like you know I don't hear you or see you talking about smt it's not required you know it's really not it's just one of those things that if it's there wonderful you know um I don't look at cot every single day I take a trade you don't need it it's just a qualifying thing that just adds more support to it if you're a long-term position Trader and you want to trade that way commitment of Traders and seasonal Tendencies coupled together with what I was showing you here that is a that's a winning recipe like that that is a really good model and just use the entry models that I've taught like with the 2022 model or even the Silver Bullet trades."

## **Silver Bullets and Market Dynamics**

*   **Silver Bullets and Price Delivery:** "And you thought I wasn't going to answer the thing you started to talk about why silver bullets form and how how the deforming why is it there they're always going to be there because of the first 30 minutes of price delivery you have 30 minutes now in the marketplace The Rush The Mad Dash to get in and do something to buy and sell that's already in the marketplace now the initial the initial surge of institutional orders being thrown out there for their clients or their own that's in the market now too so now we have 30 minutes behind us the initial impulsiveness that usually comes into the marketplace is now behind us and now we're in the First full hour of trading after the bow the first 30 minutes is done that's like the Asian range okay now we have the real move London think about it in the 24-hour cycle kind of probably confusing some of you but the long-term students know what I'm talking about I'm looking at that that range of the intraday movement on the morning session as the same impulsiveness that comes into London where there's a lot of volume that comes in in Forex that same thing occurs in that first full hour of 10 to 11."
*   **Algorithmic Influence:** "They all want to make a Mad Dash to find profitability and a lot of the algorithms wait for that first impulsiveness to run higher or lower and that inefficiency that you find on the time frames and the models I'm showing you they all dog pile on it they're all dog piling on that one there so it's not a measure of the selling or buying pressure that's pushing it it's the algorithm itself is offering it to them it's going to move from that fair value Gap to wherever it's going to go regardless of how many people buy or sell into that guy it's it doesn't make a difference everything in price is scripted it's completely manipulated it's absolutely controlled and the only thing you're trying to do is look for that small little inefficiency when you know where you're aiming for you're aiming for some higher time frame Target like we outlined for a euro dollar and the dollar Index if you have a higher time frame bias and we know that that's a directional bias that's looking for a reason to go higher it would make sense for us to expect some kind of run higher from 9 30 going into 10 o'clock in looking backwards in seeing in that price run higher was there any inefficiency or fair value you got if there is then we can use that as an entry that has to happen at 10 o'clock till 11 o'clock the fair value Gap doesn't have to form in itself inside of that one hour period it can refer back to some Fairway Gap that formed you know in the run-up if it's bullish between 9 30 and 10 o'clock and if you're bearish and you're expecting it to move lower the fair value Gap could form in the move from 9 30's opening down to 10 o'clocks low so that price leg wherever the fair value would reside there it can return up into that."
*   **Documented Trades:** "Many times you're going to see a lot of the trades that I've taken in the past if you go I I was one of the things I want to ask you as a community I know some of you out here save everything I do and I love you for that has anybody got a full collection of every single execution I've ever made public because I I don't know where they're at once I put them out on Twitter like I don't know how to find them there's a lot of them I just don't know where they're all at if someone could like create a I don't know maybe uh a thread and throw them on that that'll be awesome I'll retweet it if you do it but the uh I would like to see them all and you can see a lot of things I'm teaching you will make much more sense to you now that I'm I'm teaching you like this you'll go back and say oh there it is I can see he just talked about that there it is he's doing it but in the early stages I wasn't trying to teach a lot of that because you know I even told my private mentorship groups I said look you know I'm gonna demonstrate it but I'm not gonna go into into detail about what it all is until some jackasses want us to go out there and start selling my videos so now I killed that whole show and put the core content videos up on my YouTube channel that's known that's another reason why it's not coming down when I leave in November so anyway."

## **Gold Trading and FOMC Setups**

*   **Gold Analysis:** "We talked about uh gold too and when I do gold and I'll I'll teach you the FMC setups and we're done for today let's go into gold let's go to a daily chart and I always use forex.com I don't have an account with them that's just the feed I go with and I trust that one I don't look at Orlando or pepperstone I don't use any of these other ones it helps provide uh a consistent medium for everyone because especially if we're using Forex if you look at different Brokers they're going to have a different opinion about what the high and low was right all right so uh anyway gold I at first when I opened it up I said you know I wouldn't touch it I wouldn't I don't know but like I always do I say gun to my head I said I think we're gonna go below the sell side here these relative equal loads so again you can find that at the 20 minute and five second marker of the June 13th 2023 video with analysis okay so let's go into this and we'll segue into the four oh not the Forex but the fomc how to trade it and it's the same premise that I'm going to teach you that it's the same application whether you're trading uh non-profit payroll or um FMC they're treated the same way fomc generally is a much more larger magnitude of a move but there's they're using the same macro they use the same thing it always happens the same way it's just a much more muted event when it's non-farm payroll so anyway I took your attention into these relative equal lows I said okay I think it's going to go there so that's what I thought was going to be the draw that's where I thought we would reach for and I didn't say anything beyond that okay I didn't say anything lower I didn't say anything higher I said you know this is we're going to reach for so that was said to you on the 13th of June so let's go into a 15 minute chart we'll get through this one pretty quick [Music] take a 10 minute break and then I'll come back and teach you how to trade fomc and non-farm payroll and then we'll bid each other farewell [Music] okay all right so this line is that level from the daily chart which is the relative equal lows it's the 1938.20 level okay and we would be looking for a drop down when you're going lower and I should have dropped into a 60 Minute chart when I drop into a 15. okay so those are those relative equals from the daily but now seen on an hourly chart and you can see on the 13th we created another low here so resting below here was a large pool of what kind of stops sell stops why would they be sell stops down there because look at the movement from here up Traders are going to chase that it goes down they see it doesn't go here and it rips one more time so what are they what are they trying to sell the idea of when I say they it's the real market makers it's the folks that are controlling price and yes gold is one of the highest manipulated instruments there is it's literally a joke and that's why I don't like trading it I know a lot of you like to ask about all the time but this one is extremely manipulated it's like the Japanese Yen like I can't stand it okay it's so absolutely ridiculous how controlled it is I choose not to touch it and just like the Swiss franc too good grief he's leaving everything the weather this low and this low their cell stops below this low sells though so they were selling the idea that this is a trading range and buy everything think about it there's so many people out there on YouTube they're still making videos like this today I have a range here every time I get to the low end of the range you got to buy it and you can make money every time and all of a sudden I did that kind of stuff at 20 years old I did all that the indicators and the oscillators will tell you every single one of these loads at the perfect oversold condition and that's what tricks you so when I stopped looking at the market like that and looked at it from liquidity or inefficiency then I didn't rely on the Uber oversold I could see a robot oversold relative to the range that we're trading in which is really what mathematically is being done and tortured in in indicators like you're defining a look back period generally 14 period 10 period nine period and then you're basing that range as high as high and low is low and where you're at in relationship to that so you need an oscillator to tell you that like this right here we're above 50 of this High to that low below these lows is sell side liquidity the gun to my head I told you that's where I think we're going to trade to so is it higher after the 13th when I told you that no it only went up to go to a short-term premium the short-term premium is relative to this high down that low at equilibrium or higher as a premium we're definitely in a premium okay so we don't need to see an oscillator tell you it's over bar oversold it's defined by that if you pulled up a Williams for sonar 10 period or a stochastic it's going to show you overbought right there I don't need to see that I already know it's there once you understand how to read price and read what range you're in presently it's easy to identify what is a robot or result and you don't need any indicator to tell you that you don't need to see a moving average crossover or a macd to tell you where Market flow or Market momentum is."


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining every detail, nuance, and the original tone while structuring it for better readability and comprehension:

# **Gold Trading, FOMC Setups, and NQ Analysis**

## **Analyzing Gold Price Action and Liquidity**

*   **Building a False Narrative:** "Looking at what it's doing, it's building a narrative that this is supposed to be trusted as support, and that's building and engineering sell-side liquidity."
*   **Wiping Out Traders:** "I'm sure some of you watched it rallying up here and thought, you know, on the 14th, ICT's got it wrong, and the only thing I did is trade up into a premium and then wipe out. They ran right for those sell stops."
*   **Reaction After Sell Stop Run:** "What was the reaction after it did that? Look where we're at now."
*   **Opportunity in Market Environments:** "Now I'm not suggesting that there isn't opportunity in this market or there wasn't an opportunity, because there really was. I don't want to trade in these Market environments."
*   **Past Trading Approach:** "There was a time as a young man in my 20s, I wanted to capture these moves from here to here and here to here and here to here. I wanted to be in everything, and I discerned that while it's possible, I didn't have the aptitude to be able to do that yet, and I lost money in blue accounts trying to do that trying to learn how to do it with real money. It does not work. You have to know what you're doing and be bored with the things that you're doing in that process over and over and over again before you even think about putting real money in there."
*   **Closer Look with 15-Minute Time Frame:** "Anyway, let's take a closer look with the 15-minute time frame now we have that context."

## **FOMC Trading Strategy: A Two-Stage Approach**

*   **FOMC Event Timing:** "At two o'clock yesterday there was an event that took place and what event was that? **FOMC**, right?"
*   **Two-Stage Treatment:** "At two o'clock whenever there's an **FOMC** event it's to be treated in two stages okay this is going to be a general rule of thumb it will serve you more times than not you will lose money on it eventually if you push it every single time I promise you that but if you go back and study old moves you'll be quickly convinced that what I'm about to tell you my long-term students know this and we expect it all the time."
*   **Addressing Negative Mindsets:** "I had two folks tweeted me yesterday who I unfor I I can't I can't deal with people if you're going to come in and you show me this type of perspective or mindset you are not ready to learn from me so I I just block them it's not because I don't want to take heat from people because I'm my best trolls my biggest trolls are not blocked by me so it's not a thin-skinned type thing I I don't have time or energy to deal with people that are close-minded and if you're brand new and you come to me on Twitter and I share an example of me executing I hate seeing all after the fact again or someone supporting that idea immediately you're showing me that you are not there to learn or you're not in the proper mindset so I broom you quick I get rid of you um if you think you know everything or if you think I owe you an execution to put you into a trade that you can copy me you don't know who I am I'm not promising you that and that's one of the biggest things a pet peeve I don't want anybody being able to copy me I got people constantly asking me what's the color of your candles I know why because they want to take the videos like this one that doesn't have a watermark on it and anytime I do an execution unless I have my watermark in it you know they invariably find their way on to tick tock they're on Instagram they're on Facebook they're on YouTube under somebody else's thing saying they took the trade so I don't like that okay I know I know my own trades I don't need the like they can you can block out everything I know who who's trading that if I'm looking at I know it's me and everybody else can recognize when I'm trading because you know it is what it is but I don't want people copying me so if you're new like this is the first time you listen to me I call things before it happens and people will tell you it's easy to do that anybody can do that but these same people are all day long saying well we gotta watch and see what's going on up here oh well it could go down here you got to be careful oh no it's getting tight in here and all of a sudden after the fact they'll say I did not call this stuff no I say gun to my head this is what the gonna happen and there it is even if I'm not certain I will tell you what side I'm on and I'm comfortable being wrong in those instances but when I don't say a gun to my head and I say this is where I think it's going to happen bet your ass is going there okay that's what's happening so I'm not in this business to try to have an opportunity for all of you to copycat me I am in this business to tell you how to do this I don't need to be doing this but I want you to succeed but you will not succeed by copying me or trying to get money right now because you're short on change and that'll inspire you to do if you don't want to learn how to do this by what I've already shown or taught or see my students doing nothing's going to convince you so that's why I I distinguish the the grade of student that comes to me the people that just simply want to listen learn and practice and put the time into it they're not going to complain and they're not going to ask for more than I've already given and that's the people I'm teaching that's the people that keeps me coming back here I broom entitlement I get rid of that I don't want I don't have any tolerance for it and you can have the opinion of me whatever you want I don't care but I'm the only out here that's telling you where it's going to go precisely every single week and I'm asking nothing for it nothing I'm I'm here all day today so just know that you're not obligated to be here and not sure as and I'm going to teach you any of this I love doing it but I if if you come to me on social media and you talk that nonsense to me with an entitlement mindset or oh it's after the fact and you didn't go through the process of hearing me explain how all these things happen I've already taught how this works and the reason why I'm saying this because I'm about to teach you how to trade fomc and it's the same thing with non-farm payroll same macro that's being utilized okay it's a two-stage macro that means it's a first run and then reversal okay it doesn't happen every single hundred percent of time but most of the time unless they intervene that's what the macro will do it will go to levels as you watch me call out on the CPI I told you where the fair value Gap was I told you where the two pools of liquidity the very specific elements that led to that delivery at CPI it happened you can't trade it it's happening too fast and the broker will not let you get filled anybody that shows you them getting filled that is a white label fake mt4 horseshit it's fake it's fake it's fake I don't give a who you are it's fake you are not getting filled on those things it's not happening period but if you wait until these reports come out in that first initial Surge and they put the the availability of the trade back in place all Brokers pull their they don't they don't want to be getting caught on the the wrong side of some goober that got lucky that's the reason why it happens folks it's not because nobody wants to trade it or they're scared they the broker doesn't want to have that incurred risk that's the reality that's it that's what's going on okay but they caught something else because think about when you look at that perspective it's like you you know I could be making money right here and you're preventing yeah that's exactly what they're doing they're saving their own ass they're protecting themselves and guess what I'd be doing the same thing because you can get lucky I got lucky I got lucky for months early on I did and then found out I didn't know so would it make sense for someone that has millions of dollars available and you customer deposits and they are over leveraging that 30 to 1. and they get right on an over leverage position on a big fast runner 100 Handles in NQ you know 50 Handles in the ES come on man like you wouldn't take that risk on either so you can't fault them but it's just the reality of this business it is what it is but you don't need that first initial search it's better for you to wait and they paint all these scenarios with the first initial run oh it's going to keep going lower or what's going oh it's going to keep going higher so think about it like this at two o'clock we see gold do this run here rips lower remember this is the low I told you it was going to go to did it go to it at two o'clock it's a 15 minute Candlestick by the way it drops down but falls short of the objective and then leaves this low in this low as relative equal lows and then it rips up higher What's Happening Here what's occurring it's setting the stage for traders that suspect that this is support we can go long it's going to Rally that's not what we want to see go into the the expectation I'll teach you where the fair value Gap or the imbalance it drops leaves this inefficiency right here when it drops it comes back up into it there to offer an opportunity to go short and then it delivers where I sit on the 13th which is that relative equal lows on the daily chart it digs into it here lower lower one more good time and then rips higher today all of this price action in here I I'm telling you I would not be in any of that I didn't at all if I was looking at Gold real time I would have told you that it's possibly going to go here but I wouldn't touch it and that's the honest God truth I ask any of my long-term students I say this all the time about gold I don't know what it is this fascination with trading gold but there are better markers to trade than this but that two stage or a second stage of delivery after 2 30. see the first move is like a a red herring hey pay attention over here look at all this okay and then at 2 30 that's the real move that's the real one okay so it can it can come in two forms it can go rally up suck everybody in thinking it's going go lower and then wipes them completely out and goes lower a lot or it can drop lower get everybody thinking at two o'clock that it's going lower and then at 2 30 it rips and takes out the height it was formed prior to drop okay that's the buy or sell in that way the other thing is where it drops down a lot leaves a fair Bay Gap and at 2 30 it'll go back to the fair value Gap then the real run comes most times most times it does not do this usually it creates a run One Direction and that direction is a complete Judas swing where it runs creates a high it doesn't come back to that high and just makes a lower low in the day ES two o'clock I know I've got people sending me messages saying that the title is wrong I know it'll be changed I mislabeled my notes Friday and everything since then I mentioned that earlier in the recording of the uh two o'clock is the initial leg of fomc we dropped rallied higher fair value Gap drops down rips up higher and then one more time drops lower if you look at the first move going into a clock what is the first move it's dropping down so it's setting what what's the expectation what's retail going to think it's going to keep doing lower this fair value Gap is utilized twice two times trades into here rallies they dig into it again today one more time and then they send it higher on NQ this will be much more impactful because I actually executed on it it's all I'm sorry all right so we have yeah um we started where should yeah so this is the NQ and I want to take everything off this [Music] strip it down to nothing all right so here we have NQ NASDAQ delivery contract month is September 2023 inside this drop okay think about what I've talked about here think about what I've been talking about for weeks in relationship to es even the s p and the NASDAQ futures contract which of those two has been the leadership on the upside which one has the strongest price delivery for being bullish and Q NASDAQ so if we consider trading fomc doesn't it make more sense if we want to go long why would we want to go along what was the move that took place on the drop down into two o'clock it's dropping at two o'clock so here's your fake move so this drop down here and then they hold it here holding it holding holding holding it and at 2 30 the macro begins so when you're Trading fomc if you're not writing this down you're completely wasting your time you have to know which of the indices that you're going to trade because of relative strength which one's stronger there's always going to be a leadership issue whether it be NASDAQ or ES Dao okay if it's Dao I just go to ES if it's NASDAQ I will trade NASDAQ over ES if it's anything leading to the weaker or the stronger for the Dow I always elect to use the Es as a deferment I defer myself to trading only yes not the uh the down so if it's a matter of picking which entity I'm trading it's either decision of whether trading the NASDAQ and it has to be the leadership on the upside that means it's been going up longer Harder Faster than ES if es is going up longer Harder Faster than NASDAQ if it was reversed in its role I would have taken this trade in es and not NASDAQ so the first delivery at two o'clock was seeing price do what drop down I want to go into a five minute chart when this Market dropped here what was the where was the uh most energetic price leg beginning from here at this big move here I'm not saying that you can't see this one as a high or this is a higher this is a high but this is the most energetic so all of this starts the Run going into fomc so anyone that's in this move wears their stop loss right about that short-term High I'm aware but remember I'm listening to this guy tell me how to run my pool and I'm not really paying attention to him and I'm trying to get an example on fomc and I'm doing it with my phone which is what you see on my Twitter feed okay tools playing in the background it's what it is okay so I think it's going to go up here but I can't pretend to be listening to this guy and watch all this watch all this stuff happen as it's going on so I picked a very easy target low hanging fruit objective which is going to be the buy stops resting Above This short-term High why was I going long in here what was I looking at this move here I'm sorry this movie this down closed candle here all of this movement in here back and forth I'm treating that as like a very small little bounce price range it's going back and forth back and forth so I'm trusting that there shouldn't be any more meaningful run below that if we take out that candle's High we have it here so we take it out High that low now becomes that's it there's no more need for any more risk going lower the the stage is set because what time is it 225 the first stage of that delivery in the strongest of all the indices which is the NASDAQ I'm not looking at or caring about es I'm not looking or caring about the Dow I'm not looking at relationships between the smt I don't care about that it's time the macro will run on time it's going to favor this Market because it's been outperformed on the upside so it's its sponsorship is heavily on this one going up versus the es like it's been doing for weeks and"
*   **The Importance of Studying Old Moves:** "But if you go back and study old moves, you'll be quickly convinced that what I'm about to tell you, my long-term students know this, and we expect it all the time."
*   **Blocking Close-Minded Individuals:** "If you're going to come in and you show me this type of perspective or mindset, you are not ready to learn from me, so I just block them."
*   **Not Promising Trade Copies:** "I don't want anybody being able to copy me."
*   **Calling Moves Before They Happen:** "I call things before it happens."

## **Understanding the Macro: First Run, Then Reversal**

*   **FOMC and Non-Farm Payroll Similarity:** "The reason why I'm saying this because I'm about to teach you how to trade FOMC and it's the same thing with non-farm payroll. Same macro that's being utilized."
*   **Two-Stage Macro:** "It's a two-stage macro, that means it's a first run and then reversal."
*   **CPI Example:** "As you watch me call out on the CPI, I told you where the fair value Gap was, I told you where the two pools of liquidity."
*   **Broker Behavior During Reports:** "If you wait until these reports come out in that first initial Surge and they put the the availability of the trade back in place all Brokers pull their they don't they don't want to be getting caught on the the wrong side of some goober that got lucky that's the reason why it happens folks it's not because nobody wants to trade it or they're scared they the broker doesn't want to have that incurred risk that's the reality that's it that's what's going on okay but they caught something else because think about when you look at that perspective it's like you you know I could be making money right here and you're preventing yeah that's exactly what they're doing they're saving their own ass they're protecting themselves and guess what I'd be doing the same thing because you can get lucky I got lucky I got lucky for months early on I did and then found out I didn't know so would it make sense for someone that has millions of dollars available and you customer deposits and they are over leveraging that 30 to 1. and they get right on an over leverage position on a big fast runner 100 Handles in NQ you know 50 Handles in the ES come on man like you wouldn't take that risk on either so you can't fault them but it's just the reality of this business it is what it is but you don't need that first initial search it's better for you to wait and they paint all these scenarios with the first initial run oh it's going to keep going lower or what's going oh it's going to keep going higher."
*   **Gold's Two O'Clock Move:** "At two o'clock we see gold do this run here rips lower remember this is the low I told you it was going to go to did it go to it at two o'clock it's a 15 minute Candlestick by the way it drops down but falls short of the objective and then leaves this low in this low as relative equal lows and then it rips up higher What's Happening Here what's occurring it's setting the stage for traders that suspect that this is support we can go long it's going to Rally that's not what we want to see go into the the expectation I'll teach you where the fair value Gap or the imbalance it drops leaves this inefficiency right here when it drops it comes back up into it there to offer an opportunity to go short and then it delivers where I sit on the 13th which is that relative equal lows on the daily chart it digs into it here lower lower one more good time and then rips higher today all of this price action in here I I'm telling you I would not be in any of that I didn't at all if I was looking at Gold real time I would have told you that it's possibly going to go here but I wouldn't touch it and that's the honest God truth I ask any of my long-term students I say this all the time about gold I don't know what it is this fascination with trading gold but there are better markers to trade than this but that two stage or a second stage of delivery after 2 30."
*   **Gold's Red Herring:** "See the first move is like a a red herring hey pay attention over here look at all this okay and then at 2 30 that's the real move that's the real one."
*   **Two Forms of Move:** "It can come in two forms it can go rally up suck everybody in thinking it's going go lower and then wipes them completely out and goes lower a lot or it can drop lower get everybody thinking at two o'clock that it's going lower and then at 2 30 it rips and takes out the height it was formed prior to drop okay that's the buy or sell in that way the other thing is where it drops down a lot leaves a fair Bay Gap and at 2 30 it'll go back to the fair value Gap then the real run comes most times most times it does not do this usually it creates a run One Direction and that direction is a complete Judas swing where it runs creates a high it doesn't come back to that high and just makes a lower low in the day."

## **NQ Analysis and FOMC Execution**

*   **ES and NQ:** "ES two o'clock I know I've got people sending me messages saying that the title is wrong I know it'll be changed I mislabeled my notes Friday and everything since then I mentioned that earlier in the recording of the uh two o'clock is the initial leg of fomc we dropped rallied higher fair value Gap drops down rips up higher and then one more time drops lower if you look at the first move going into a clock what is the first move it's dropping down so it's setting what what's the expectation what's retail going to think it's going to keep doing lower this fair value Gap is utilized twice two times trades into here rallies they dig into it again today one more time and then they send it higher on NQ this will be much more impactful because I actually executed on it it's all I'm sorry all right so we have yeah um we started where should yeah so this is the NQ and I want to take everything off this [Music] strip it down to nothing all right so here we have NQ NASDAQ delivery contract month is September 2023 inside this drop okay think about what I've talked about here think about what I've been talking about for weeks in relationship to es even the s p and the NASDAQ futures contract which of those two has been the leadership on the upside which one has the strongest price delivery for being bullish and Q NASDAQ so if we consider trading fomc doesn't it make more sense if we want to go long why would we want to go along what was the move that took place on the drop down into two o'clock it's dropping at two o'clock so here's your fake move so this drop down here and then they hold it here holding it holding holding holding it and at 2 30 the macro begins so when you're Trading fomc if you're not writing this down you're completely wasting your time you have to know which of the indices that you're going to trade because of relative strength which one's stronger there's always going to be a leadership issue whether it be NASDAQ or ES Dao okay if it's Dao I just go to ES if it's NASDAQ I will trade NASDAQ over ES if it's anything leading to the weaker or the stronger for the Dow I always elect to use the Es as a deferment I defer myself to trading only yes not the uh the down so if it's a matter of picking which entity I'm trading it's either decision of whether trading the NASDAQ and it has to be the leadership on the upside that means it's been going up longer Harder Faster than ES if es is going up longer Harder Faster than NASDAQ if it was reversed in its role I would have taken this trade in es and not NASDAQ so the first delivery at two o'clock was seeing price do what drop down I want to go into a five minute chart when this Market dropped here what was the where was the uh most energetic price leg beginning from here at this big move here I'm not saying that you can't see this one as a high or this is a higher this is a high but this is the most energetic so all of this starts the Run going into fomc so anyone that's in this move wears their stop loss right about that short-term High I'm aware but remember I'm listening to this guy tell me how to run my pool and I'm not really paying attention to him and I'm trying to get an example on fomc and I'm doing it with my phone which is what you see on my Twitter feed okay tools playing in the background it's what it is okay so I think it's going to go up here but I can't pretend to be listening to this guy and watch all this watch all this stuff happen as it's going on so I picked a very easy target low hanging fruit objective which is going to be the buy stops resting Above This short-term High why was I going long in here what was I looking at this move here I'm sorry this movie this down closed candle here all of this movement in here back and forth I'm treating that as like a very small little bounce price range it's going back and forth back and forth so I'm trusting that there shouldn't be any more meaningful run below that if we take out that candle's High we have it here so we take it out High that low now becomes that's it there's no more need for any more risk going lower the the stage is set because what time is it 225 the first stage of that delivery in the strongest of all the indices which is the NASDAQ I'm not looking at or caring about es I'm not looking or caring about the Dow I'm not looking at relationships between the smt I don't care about that it's time the macro will run on time it's going to favor this Market because it's been outperformed on the upside so it's its sponsorship is heavily on this one going up versus the es like it's been doing for weeks and."
*   **NASDAQ Leadership:** "Which of those two has been the leadership on the upside? Which one has the strongest price delivery for being bullish? NQ NASDAQ."
*   **FOMC Trade Logic:** "So if we consider trading FOMC, doesn't it make more sense if we want to go long?"
*   **Two O'Clock Drop:** "What was the move that took place on the drop down into two o'clock? It's dropping at two o'clock. So here's your fake move."
*   **NQ and ES Preference:** "If it's NASDAQ, I will trade NASDAQ over ES."
*   **Most Energetic Price Leg:** "When this Market dropped here, what was the where was the most energetic price leg beginning from here at this big move here."
*   **Buy Stops as Objective:** "So I picked a very easy target low hanging fruit objective which is going to be the buy stops resting Above This short-term High."
*   **Down Closed Candle:** "What was I looking at this move here I'm sorry this movie this down closed candle here all of this movement in here back and forth I'm treating that as like a very small little bounce price range it's going back and forth back and forth so I'm trusting that there shouldn't be any more meaningful run below that if we take out that candle's High we have it here so we take it out High that low now becomes that's it there's no more need for any more risk going lower."
*   **2:25 PM and Macro:** "The stage is set because what time is it 225 the first stage of that delivery in the strongest of all the indices which is the NASDAQ I'm not looking at or caring about es I'm not looking or caring about the Dow I'm not looking at relationships between the smt I don't care about that it's time the macro will run on time it's going to favor this Market because it's been outperformed on the upside so it's its sponsorship is heavily on this one going up versus the es like it's been doing for weeks and."

I have done my best to capture every detail and nuance in a well-structured format. I hope this is helpful.


Okay, here is the reorganized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining every detail, nuance, and the original tone while structuring it for better readability and comprehension:

# **FOMC Execution, Liquidity Analysis, and Market Relationships**

## **NQ Trade Execution Details**

*   **Focus on NASDAQ:** "The **Dow** has already proven it's lethargic; it's not interested in performing like the **ES** and, or not even close to **NASDAQ**, so all focus would be on **NASDAQ**."
*   **Long Entry Point:** "So buying, going long right here, what am I keying off of? Look at the arrow where I entered and what I've already told you, this body of this candle, the last down closed candle, I'm using as 'Bella' by the way."
*   **Buying the Dip:** "This movement down into here, I'm buying that right there, right there bought that."
*   **Pyramiding Strategy:** "Then I'm using this right here, this opening price, and inside this little area here, I want to use that as a means of wanting to go long on a pyramid, so I went along with five contracts, which is not a lot, and I added another one, which is, I'm pilloring."
*   **Profit Target:** "What am I aiming for here? Just before we get to this high because during **FOMC** it could do this wild whip saw still and then deliver up, I want to get in, or I'm sorry, I want to get out of my trade as it approaches this high, low hanging fruit, I don't need it to go to the high or higher to get a fill."
*   **Exit Point:** "There's my exit on this candle here, all this rundown is completely wiped out, ultimately taking out that high here over here."

## **Two-Stage Macro Explained**

*   **Non-Farm Payroll Parallel:** "Two stages, non-farm payroll is the same way, it either gives you a drop, come back to a fair bag Gap and continue, or it gives you a drop and completely reverse and rip higher everything reversed."
*   **Identifying the Pattern:** "The difference in knowing which one it is is how it trades at the time, which is why I have to wait, I have to see what it's doing, how it delivers and compare it to the other averages, that's what I'm looking for, I'm looking for that relationship between the other."
*   **Not SMT Divergence:** "It's not **SMT**, I'm looking at how who's been leading the pack higher or lower whenever these reports come out."
*   **Liquidity Consideration:** "And then I'm looking for where the liquidity is, traders that were trying to chase this, they're trapped down here, they're hoping it's going to go lower back up it goes."
*   **Historical Analysis:** "Go back and look at your calendar and every time there was a **FOMC** radio announcement and non-farm payroll, study how that liquidity is taken, study that it's always a two-stage macro, it always does something initially that gets people thinking it's going to do something specific and then it rips their face off."
*   **CPI on Steroids:** "**CPI** is that macro on steroids, on crack, on meth, okay it's it's literally like cocained up the same macro and you can't trade that you can't okay you can't."

## **Navigating High Impact News Events**

*   **Post-News Waiting Period:** "So all these high impact news drivers and or medium impact news drivers, if you're afraid of those, just wait 30 minutes minimum, make wait 30 minutes after they form and then see what liquidity resides in the marketplace still in any inefficiency and if it offers you a range that presents potential to see 10 handles, then you probably have a good chance of making five out of it or maybe even more."
*   **Patience is Key:** "So it's a there's a lot of waiting around to see what happens on these big impact news drivers because you don't know and I don't know before it happens how they're going to use that information to manipulate it because they want people chasing this idea at the moment."
*   **Broker Liquidity Management:** "And they know that Brokers are pulling liquidity not that there is an absence of trading or interest it just means that all the Brokers are collectively saying the hell with this we are not getting caught on the wrong side because if they get a client or a large base of their clients that are over leveraging and everybody predominantly over leverages you know you do it too what happens if they're right on a big move day the Brokers are out they're not trying to do that."
*   **Trust the Delay:** "So wait wait for that initial shock and Trust the fact that you don't need that first move to make money, you don't need it, wait for the the first move in two o'clock at **FOMC** and then 225 230 then it's going to rip the other direction that's that's what it is that's exactly what happens."
*   **Two-Stage Analogy:** "It's kind of like uh well I don't want to say it in the live stream because I think my channel might get flagged but I've said the analogy before on **Twitter** and stuff and I'll talk about it this weekend in a **Shotgun Saturday** I'm sure you're all wondering what it is it's not a big deal it's just it's a analogy I use that has something to do with uh making individuals run to a specific area and then attacking that once they get there for a larger impactful you know event that's that's what I mean by two stage."
*   **Corral and Break:** "So it's designed to Corral Traders into one big area make them think it's going to do a specific thing so that way there is a pool of liquidity that's being sacrificed and then that liquidity is being used for a counterparty so it's tricking traders to go in the wrong direction and then breaking them across the coals the other direction."

## **Closing Remarks and Key Takeaways**

*   **Session Wrap-Up:** "That is going to be it for today, we went through my entire hit list of everything and I was a little bit short on my time two o'clock that's pretty good isn't it, you got some uh got some value today."
*   **Addressing Misunderstandings:** "I talked about a lot of things that hopefully will amplify some of the misunderstandings or or shortcomings in terms of your learning and I amplify the own things that I know I get a lot of requests for Breakaway gaps and introduced more insight about a balanced price range and uh preached that we focus on understanding which one is the leadership and when does it matter when does it really matter to be in the the one that's a leadership."
*   **Learning from Both Right and Wrong:** "Because you see **ICT** trading the yes even though I told you **NASDAQ** weeks ago was a strong one so why aren't you trading that one because I'm teaching you how you can still find profitability if you did it wrong if you found something as a setup and you didn't confer with the relationships between the averages okay."
*    **Forex Pair Relationships:** "Or if you're a Forex repair Trader you didn't do the relationships between which is stronger the British pound versus the US dollar or the euro versus the US dollar you want to be in the stronger one if you're going long you want to be in the weaker one if you're going short well when it matters most is when we have these high impact news drivers because they're going to really capitalize in Wind these markets out when they are the leadership issue."
*   **Visual Example NASDAQ vs ES:** "Look at the relationship between the **NASDAQ** here in **ES**, you see it right away don't you, it was not able to climb as high look look at here here to here okay I'm going to take you back to the **NASDAQ** see that higher that's why **ICT** was buying this one and not **ES**."
*   **Funded Account Traders:** "And you know funded account uh traders that have you found their way into I guess the part where they can make money and then take the money that people pay in and call themselves you know paid out whatever that is a trade right here that they could do it's not the maximum number of contracts available that they can trade it's less than and that run right there is equivalent to twenty three thousand dollars so you you tell me is it worth the gamble of trying to guess before the fact or waiting for the initial you impact crater to form and then you go over there and find the people that you can pick the pockets of that you know they're dead already you don't know it and you go there and you take their money from their accounts and get out and walk away."
*   **Rambo Perspective:** "I'll leave you with the idea of that being a good analysis or not but I'm usually the action guy that you know sees things from a Rambo perspective that's just the way I look at things but the if you want to look at it as ballerinas dancing around yeah whatever whoever whatever whatever suits you that helps you understand you know what the Market's doing it's wonderful but uh yeah my audience predominantly is male so and I'm a guy so I I kind of like lean to that."
*   **Weaker ES Displayed:** "One more time you can see the difference between the two much much weaker on **ES**."

## **Dow Analysis and Market Manipulation Concerns**

*   **Hunger Mention:** "So it's two o'clock and my stomach is growling so the only thing I had today was bone broth so I'm somewhat hungry."
*   **Dow's Inefficiency:** "Real quick I just want to show you the down okay so we have a drop the Fairway Gap it trades into here and they reclaim it there today and then they sent it higher so it's a little bit of a delay to take out the relative equal highs we mentioned this high on the 13th of June and that's where it hit it and just retraced lower and now we're climbing above it here I'm not really excited about the **Dow** still."
*   **Six Sister Application:** "If even I was willing to trade it I still wouldn't be interested in trading where it's at you might be thinking well wouldn't six sister apply to that because it has a lot of ground to gain to try to catch up with **NASDAQ** or even **ES** maybe I just don't trade down it's it's a a real spotty index and it's only 30 stocks that make it up so it's very easily manipulated okay."
*   **Dow vs Gold:** "And I want to say it in the same way like I mentioned but gold because it's nowhere near the degree of manipulation and endowed that is in Gold but **Dow** is very thin okay meaning there isn't a lot of trading that takes place in it versus the **ES** in the **NASDAQ** and **NASDAQ** is a fast Market because it's thinner too so that's really what makes the the **ES** a little bit slower but sometimes there's a little bit of a inversion where **ES** will outperformed the **NASDAQ**."
*   **Currency Pair Analogy:** "But uh most of the time the **NASDAQ** acts like the British pound versus the Euro okay **ES** will be equivalent to like a Euro and **NASDAQ** is equivalent to how British penetrates British pound always exaggerates the move that would be seen in Europe which is why I always predominantly like to trade the cable which is pound dollar but there are times when euro dollar will outperform cable and you have to know the things I'm teaching here the relationships of measuring when to look at it and when not to consider it and you can't learn that in just one video you have to see it experience it see analysis see things called in advance watch how it performs also back test all those things should be included when you're looking at Price moves."
*   **Forex Journaling Adive:** "Like when you're looking at Forex price runs and you're logging them for your Journal you want to be looking at other closely correlated pairs not just the one that you see the setup in so that way you're getting a a real clear depiction of what everything else around that pair was dealing at the same time so that way it's not this in and of itself an island of itself saying I'm doing whatever I want to do no it's being subordinate to the macro that's under underway in all the markets."

## **Parting Words and Weekend Plans**

*   **Enough for Today:** "Anyway I think I've given you enough today to give myself a day off and a three-day weekend."
*   **Title Change and Upcoming Content:** "And I understand yes it's not Friday so I'll be changing the title of this and I will catch up with you I'm sure somewhere on **Twitter** I don't know but if I don't talk to you tomorrow on on **Twitter** I will talk to you **Saturday** morning at nine o'clock for a **Saturday shotgun with ICT** so I'll talk to you next time be safe."

I have done my best to capture every detail and nuance in a well-structured format. I hope this is helpful.

Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, formatted for readability and detail retention:

# **The TGIF Setup: A Day-Based Algorithmic ICT Trading Model**

## **Introduction**

Welcome! This lesson focuses on the **TGIF setup**, an algorithmic ICT (Inner Circle Trader) trading model.  "TGIF" stands for "Thank God It's Friday." This model can be applied across all assets.

*   This is a day-specific model, meaning it appears only one day per week: **Friday**.
*   The name "Thank God It's Friday" is a pun on the common expression used in the United States, "TGIF," which celebrates the end of the workweek and the beginning of the weekend.
*   The pattern is characterized by a retracement into the current weekly range.

## **Weekly Power 3 and Distribution Phase**

We will discuss the **weekly power 3** concept and its distribution phase.

## **Top-Down Analysis: NASDAQ Futures Contract (One-Month Chart)**

Let's examine the NASDAQ Futures Contract using a one-month chart. A **top-down approach** is crucial for analysis.

*   The **TGIF trade** is highly precise when anchored against higher timeframe premium or discount arrays.
*   We are currently describing a **premium distribution** scenario.
    *   The assumption is that the market has been rising.
    *   We're seeking measures of exhaustion for the weekly range.
    *   Anticipating a pullback into said weekly range.

As you can see here is the monthly chart for Nasdaq, and for those that are just watching this video in the future you can go through and look at the dated analysis and commentary videos I placed on my YouTube channel that we're focusing on how NASDAQ and all the stock index features were called higher

### **Monthly Chart Analysis: Fair Value Gap**

*   A small imbalance is visible as a **fair value gap** (sell-side imbalance, buy-side inefficiency).
    *   Defined by range extremes.
    *   This month's low and this month's high.
    *   Downside delivery (sell-side) requires buy-side delivery.
    *   Buy-side delivery is seen here in June 2023.
*   This is a **premium fair value gap** on the monthly chart.

## **Moving to the Weekly Chart**

With these monthly levels identified, let's move to the weekly chart.

### **Weekly Chart: Relationship to Monthly Levels**

*   The weekly chart displays levels derived from the monthly chart.
*   Price reached up into a **monthly premium fair value gap**.
    *   The high and low of the fair value gap are identified directly on the monthly chart.
*   The weekly chart *alone* might not show a clear fair value gap, highlighting the importance of top-down analysis.

### **Disregarding Current Week's Data**

*   It is currently Monday. (last week of trading this is represented by that week here)
*   This is a brand new week.
*   Please disregard the current week's candle (we don't have a way to remove it from the chart).

### **Weekly Chart: Premium Fair Value Gap Interaction**

*   Price reached up into a premium fair value gap.
*   This often leads to a pullback.
*   Price moved up to the upper end of the monthly premium fair value gap (shown on the weekly chart) and then retraced towards the low end of that range.
*   The range refers to the monthly fair value gap.

## **Zooming In: Closer Look at Weekly Price Action**

Let's zoom in for a closer look at the price action.

### **Refined Weekly View**

*   Zoomed in on the weekly chart, a clear fair value gap may not be apparent.
*   The market trades just shy of the high, which represents the highest part of the monthly premium fair value gap.
*   There is a very small imbalance; commentary will be reserved on that. Focus on this specific area.

### **NASDAQ's Performance and Weekly Candles**

*   NASDAQ has shown multiple weeks of upward movement.
*   We have been anticipating NASDAQ's leadership on the upside compared to the Dow and S&P.
*   NASDAQ has outperformed the ES (S&P 500 futures) and the Dow.
*   Examine how each weekly candle is formed:
    *   They are all up-close candles.
    *   The close is above the midpoint of the candle's entire range.
    *   The close is near each candle's high.

## **Power 3 Concept**

Let's discuss the **Power 3 concept**. Detailed lectures on this are available on this YouTube channel. Repetition is key for mastery.

### **Power 3: General Principles**

*   Power 3 is not limited to a specific timeframe.
*   It was initially taught on a daily chart.

### **Power 3: Weekly Range Example**

Let's analyze this with reference to a weekly range.

*   **Open:**  The beginning of trading for the week.
*   **Candlestick Analysis:**  Most analysis uses candlesticks.  While I used commodity, S&P, and bond charts in the mid-90s, candlesticks are now easier to read.

### **Power 3: Bullish Scenario**

*   **Open:** Open price at midnight New York local time.
*   **Accumulation:**  Decline below the opening price.  This is *not* seen as bearish.  This is the *accumulation phase* below the opening price.
*   **Manipulation:** The open and the decline, used to accumulate long positions or for studying.  We anticipate it trading down into some discount array (a fair value gap, short-term sell stops, old high – something promoting a discount or “support” level).
*   **Expansion:** Rally higher, moving above the opening price. This is the *expansion portion* of power three. Returns into some kind of imbalance, such as a bullish fair value gap or a bullish breaker. Creates the extreme high of the week.
*   **Distribution:** Trading off the high to close. *This is the distribution phase of Power 3.*

### **Power 3 in Context of the Weekly Range**

Each weekly candlestick represents this pattern.

*   The market has been drawing upwards each week towards a certain area.
*   Each open high low and close bar is represented about each individual Candlestick here.
*   Each candle represents the open, then a trade down, a rally to make the high, and a close near the high.

### **Power 3: Bearish Scenario (Reversible Logic)**

Everything is reversible.  Apply the opposite logic to bearish scenarios.

*   **Opening:** Accumulation of short positions when you anticipate a weekly candlestick decline towards a discount array (sell-side liquidity).
*   **Manipulation:** Rally higher, tricking retail traders into thinking it’s going to break out. Smart money accumulates short positions here.
*   **Expansion:** Price moving down throughout the week towards some discount array.
*   **Distribution:**  Before the week's end, price comes off the low, closing near but off the low on Friday.

### **Power 3: Universal Application**

*   This concept isn't limited to weekly or daily charts. It applies to **every timeframe.**
*   Understanding accumulation, manipulation, and distribution helps identify setups and stick to institutional order flow.
*   Knowing the next draw on liquidity.

## **Focusing on a Specific Weekly Range**

Let's focus on the specific weekly range defined by the down and up arrows.

### **Importance of Higher Timeframe Context**

Without higher timeframe levels drawn (monthly), it's hard to determine likely targets.  That's why you should spend most of your time on higher timeframe charts. The Market's going to gravitate towards these higher time frame premium arrays or discount arrays.

*   The market gravitates towards higher timeframe premium or discount arrays.
*   If drawing towards a premium array, the bias is primarily bullish each day of the week.
*   Anticipate declines as opportunities to accumulate long positions.
*   Distribute long positions to the premium array.

## **Zooming In: Detailed Analysis of the Specific Range**

*   We're using a continuous contract for clarity.
*   Mid-June 2023, looking at the NASDAQ weekly candlestick.

### **Key Levels and TGIF Setup**

*   The low of this candle is *not* the opening price.
*   The opening price is slightly above the low.
*   We see a small separation between the low of the range and the open.
*   The price runs higher, makes the high of the week, and then closes.

### **TGIF: End-of-Week Retracement Concept**

**TGIF** is a codified setup for end-of-week range concepts. It is a reversal pattern *in the sense* that near the end of Friday's trading, you can anticipate some measure of retracement into the weekly range *if it hasn’t occurred yet*.

### **Defining the Weekly Range**

The **weekly range** spans from the lowest low of the week to the highest high of the week.

### **Timing Considerations**

Assuming it's 2 PM New York local time and you're studying index futures (NASDAQ).

*   There is a **PM session** between 2 PM and 3 PM.
*   This is the time for the formation I dubbed **ICT Silver Bullet.**
*   I have already shared an introductory lesson on my YouTube channel; more will be taught.

### **Books and Subscribers**

*   The first book will be released when I get to 1 million subscribers on the YouTube channel.
*   Six months after that, the second, then in perpetuity until we get to the fourth book.

### **TGIF and Premium Arrays**

**If** the market has reached some higher time frame premium array AND we are at 1:30 PM or so on Friday we can anticipate some measure of retracement into the weekly range.

**However:**

*   **If it hasn't reached a higher timeframe premium array**, it could continue into the close and close right on the high.
*   This is how you determine whether it will form a TGIF pattern or continue higher.

## **Range Measurement and Sweet Spot**

Assuming you can determine that a high has already formed…

*   Ignore the new week's data; focus only on the identified weekly range (high and low).
*   Measure the range from the lowest low to the highest high using a Fibonacci retracement tool. This should be done intraday as you approach the afternoon session.
*   It is more likely to form in the afternoon, especially if we had continuation on the upside in the morning session.
*   Place 0.20 and 0.3 levels on your Fibonacci.
*   These levels represent the **20% and 30% markers** for the entire weekly range.

### **Sweet Spot Levels**

*   20% level: 15326.75
*   30% level: 15252.5

These two levels define the **sweet spot** where TGIF is likely to draw into.

*   Sometimes, it can draw into 40% or more.
*   This deeper retracement is associated with reversals or market tops/bottoms, which will be discussed later.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, formatted for readability and detail retention:

# **In-Depth Discussion of the TGIF Setup: Algorithmic Price Delivery on Fridays**

## **Understanding Algorithmic Price Delivery on Fridays**

This discussion delves into how to observe **price delivery** on Fridays, whether in the morning or afternoon session. The key lies in identifying when a premium target has been reached, as exemplified by the monthly chart's fair value gap interaction.

*   The day of the week is **Friday**.
*   The market has been trending upwards throughout the week.
*   It's reasonable to anticipate a pullback.
*   The concept of "profit-taking" is discussed and refuted. The speaker argues that market movements are primarily algorithmic.
*   Markets are algorithmic, and price action is designed and engineered.

### **The Algorithmic Argument**

If an algorithm governs the marketplace:

*   It would execute specific actions.
*   The discussion proposes this idea for consideration during price action studies.

### **Measuring Repricing and the "Bullseye"**

*   The goal is to identify directives the algorithm might follow to reprice from the weekly high to a predetermined price.
*   The "**bullseye**" or "**sweet spot**" represents the anticipated retracement range.
    *   The market is not expected to close right on the high.
    *   If a pullback occurs before Friday's close, it will likely halt between the **20% and 30% range** of the weekly range.

### **Real-World Application and Long-Term Student Validation**

*   This isn't a cherry-picked example.
*   Long-term students have applied this successfully to daily and weekly ranges.
*   The speaker is teaching the core concept to enable further exploration.

## **Applying the TGIF Setup on TradingView**

This section explains how to implement the TGIF setup using TradingView.

### **Weekly Range Analysis**

*   The analysis focuses on the *previous* week's data.
*   Ignore the current week's candlestick (as it's a new week).
*   The intent is to show how this information could have been used *last* Friday.

### **Conceptual Framework**

*   The discussion aims to convey the thought process behind the setup.
*   It's a pattern that the speaker and their students actively look for.
*   Buttons were pushed on Friday and the discussion is to demonstrate the execution.

### **Key Levels: 20% and 30% Retracement**

*   **20% Level:** 15326.75
*   **30% Level:** 15252.5

These levels are derived from the high of the week.

## **NASDAQ Futures Contract: Daily Chart Analysis**

This section provides a detailed breakdown of the NASDAQ futures contract on a daily chart.

### **Candlestick Observation**

*   The specified candlestick reaches the high of the week.
    *   High: 15,475.5
*   Price subsequently retraces into the **20-30% range** of the weekly range.

### **TGIF Draw on Liquidity**

*   The 20% and 30% levels represent the **TGIF draw on liquidity**.
*   This is how to anticipate Friday's trading in terms of an intraday reversal or weekly retracement.

### **TGIF Trade Example**

*   **Monday - Thursday:** Regular trading days.
*   **Friday:**
    *   The market opens and makes the high of the week.
    *   It then trades down and closes within the 20-30% range of the total weekly range.
*   This constitutes a successful TGIF trade.

## **Hourly Chart Analysis: Refining the Setup**

The discussion transitions to an hourly chart to further refine the TGIF setup.

### **Short-Term Highs and Level Identification**

*   The market rallies, creating a short-term high.
*   These are levels to monitor *once* the high is established.
*   Anticipate the high forming around 1:30 PM, heading into 2:00 PM.

### **Assumptions and Controlled Retracement**

*   *Assumption:* The market has been bullish, reached higher timeframe premium arrays and targets.
*   A pullback is likely.
*   If a retracement occurs, it is controlled algorithmically.

### **Weekly High and Low Definition**

*   Define where the weekly high is, the low formed on Sunday at 6 PM.

### **Incorrect Terminology and Controlled Market Gravitation**

*   Retracement isn't due to "profit-taking" or an absence of buyers.
*   The market algorithmically gravitates towards 20%, 25%, or 30% retracement levels.
*   Breaching beyond 30% could indicate a more significant reversal.

### **Holiday Considerations**

*   Due to the current holiday, the trading session is shorter.
*   The high may not have been established yet.

## **15-Minute Candlestick Chart: Detailed Execution**

This section delves into the 15-minute candlestick chart, providing insights into trade execution.

### **Judas Swing and Liquidity Grabs**

*   The high forms around 9:00 AM on Friday.
*   The initial rally creates a **Judas Swing**.
    *   Entices traders to believe the market will continue higher.
*   An old high is broken, representing **buy-side liquidity**.

### **Smart Money and Counterparty Positioning**

*   Smart money uses breakout traders' pending orders as their counterparty to go short.
*   They trade with the **20-30% TGIF range** in mind.

### **ICT Order Block and Change in State of Delivery**

*   The last up-close candle before the move lower represents the **ICT order block**.
*   This signifies a change in the state of delivery.
*   It is not an "Fu candle" or an engulfing candle.

### **Assertive Tone and "Receipts"**

*   The speaker asserts their knowledge and provides supporting evidence.
*   The fair value gap on the monthly chart has been reached.

### **Entry Model and Time Distortion**

*   The 2022 entry model is highlighted.
*   Lunch hour time distortion is discussed.
*   All candles between the entry and low points are time distortion.

### **Fair Value Gap Interaction**

*   The market moves from a fair value gap (sell-side imbalance, buy-side inefficiency).
*   Sell-side delivery requires buy-side delivery, which is observed.
*   The market repeatedly interacts with the fair value gap due to the lunch hour macro.

### **Stop Runs and Reclaimed Bearish Order Block**

*   Stops are run above the high.
*   The market returns to the 15-minute bearish order block.
*   The high is respected, preventing an undermining of the scenario.

### **Sweet Spot and Algorithmic Trading**

*   Between 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM (the PM session), price runs seek liquidity.
*   It trades up into that shaded area defined on the hourly chart.
*   The reclaimed bearish order block and model 2022 sets up again.

### **Judas Swing Confirmation and Order Block Identification**

*   The market exhibits a willingness to create a Judas Swing in the morning.
*   Change in the state of delivery signifies the bare shorter block.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, formatted for readability and detail retention:

# **In-Depth Breakdown of Model 2022, TGIF, and ICT Silver Bullet Concepts**

## **Model 2022 and Fair Value Gaps (FVG)**

*   There is a **Model 2022** one-hour **Fair Value Gap (FVG)**, shaped like a city, represented by a shaded box.
*   The market hits the bearish 15-minute order block again.
*   It drops and creates a fair value gap, which is also a breaker (high, low, higher high).
*   The speaker has presented multiple models.

### **Complexity and Individual Preferences**

*   The speaker acknowledges the apparent complexity, but emphasizes they are not intentionally complicating matters.
*   The speaker is detailed but highlights that if a trader identifies a pattern they prefer within a premium array, they can focus on that specific pattern.
*   Other patterns become less important.
*   Traders can observe the speaker's teachings and adapt them to their own models.
*   The speaker isn't forcing anyone into a specific entry technique.
*   Traders should find their own model using the speaker's core concepts.
*   No single approach is inherently superior to another.

### **Avoiding Comparative Analysis of Entry Points**

*   Avoid fixating on whether selling at a higher point would yield greater profits compared to entering on a fair value gap or trading into a breaker.
*   A trader might not initially recognize a fair value gap but can identify the high, low, higher high pattern.
*   The down-closed candle, when extended, indicates trading into it.
*   This is a bearish breaker.

### **Alternative Interpretations and Entry Strategies**

*   Some students may identify a run-on stops and a subsequent break lower, leading them to trade a breaker.
*   Another student may observe a breaker and a fair value gap, dividing the range into four gradients and entering in the lower portion of the fair value gap.
*   The one-hour FVG (or SIBI) area could be traded off a gradient, specifically 25% of the range from the high and low.

### **Multiple Models and Premise of the TGIF Setup**

*   The speaker has presented numerous models.
*   The premise is that a high is forming after a bullish week, and trades are executed off that high, targeting a 20-30% retracement of the range.
*   This constitutes the TGIF setup.

### **Flexibility in PD Array Selection**

*   TGIF doesn't mandate finding a specific PD array in the move; it allows freedom in choosing which array to use.

## **Addressing Missed Opportunities and Lunch Hour Dynamics**

*   If one sees all these patterns in hindsight and misses the initial move, the market may have already traded outside the fair value gap.
*   The question is whether it has reached the 20% level after leaving the fair value gap.
*   Even if it touched it earlier, there's still time, as it might be shortly after 11:00 AM on Friday.
*   The entire afternoon and lunch session remain.
*   Lunch hour often involves running stops.
*   A rally is expected to clear out trailed buy stops.

### **Rejection Blocks and Liquidity**

*   It might not sweep the high, but it will run rejection blocks.
*   Rejection blocks serve the same function as running out liquidity.
*   The highest up-close candle before the high is the rejection block.
*   Extending it in time reveals it being swept.

### **Tolerance for Minor Deviations and Fair Value Gap Dynamics**

*   It doesn't need to take out the wick; trading inside the wick constitutes a gap.
*   A minor deviation outside the one-hour fair value gap is permissible.
*   Returning back to it is acceptable.
*   The bodies are inside the one-hour fair value gap, while the wicks cause the damage.

### **Simplifying Analysis and Utilizing Rejection Blocks**

*   If a run is anticipated, including a minor move outside the lines, focus on where the rejection block is.
*   Consult the PD array matrix taught in core content month four.
*   The highest up-close candle is the rejection block.

### **Time Distortion and Market Understanding**

*   Rejection blocks are crucial for utilizing time distortion.
*   The speaker promises more details later, but it requires understanding other factors.
*   The speaker advises against listening to others' time distortion lectures, as they are likely misinformed.

## **Applying TGIF and Anticipating Drawdown**

*   If utilizing the TGIF setup, anticipate a drawdown into 20-30% of the weekly range.
*   If the ideal entry inside the fair value gap is missed, one can still participate.

### **Refining Analysis with a One-Minute Chart**

*   The analysis drops to a one-minute chart.
*   The fair value gap from the five-minute chart is still visible.
*   The low end of the one-hour fair value gap (the shaded area) is tapped.
*   The market enters the 2:00 PM time period, indicated by a bullish candle.

### **ICT Silver Bullet and Order Flow**

*   The speaker taught about 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM as the **ICT Silver Bullet** for index futures.
*   Here, there's a high, low, higher high reacting off an hourly bearish fair value gap.
*   A fair value gap exists, indicating bearish order flow.
*   The algorithm respects every premium array.

### **Trading Opportunities and Time Considerations**

*   Small fair value gaps are rebalanced.
*   The bottom end of the hourly fair value gap is targeted.
*   Displacement lower is anticipated.
*   A breaker and fair value gap offer short entry opportunities, targeting 20-30% retracement.
*   The extent of the move depends on time.
*   The speaker shows the 2:00 PM ending at 3:00 PM.
*   The one-hour interval (2:00 PM to 3:00 PM) contains the fair value gap that forms the ICT Silver Bullet.
*   Multiple models and entry opportunities are presented.

### **Missed Entry Points and Time-Based Management**

*   If the initial entry is missed, another opportunity arises.
*   Even if it hits the 20% level, trading isn't necessarily over.
*   Time ends with the shaded area at the close (4:00 PM).
*   The bulk of trading ends at 4:00 PM New York time, unless earnings season affects after-hours trading.
*   Silver Bullet entries should be taken between 2:00 PM and 3:00 PM.

## **Additional Insights: One-Minute Chart and Order Flow Confirmation**

*   The lesson incorporates added value.
*   A zoomed-in one-minute chart shows the fair value gap inside the hourly fair value gap.
*   The bottom of the gap is tapped, reacting during the 2:00 PM hour.
*   The fair value gap with the breaker (high, low, higher high) confirms a bearish order flow.
*   The algorithm drives price down towards the 20%, 25%, and 30% levels of the weekly range.

### **Trade Execution and Outcomes**

*   A short entry is taken at 15357, ahead of the candle's high, for a guaranteed fill.
*   The trade is held to see how it performs in the last hour of trading.
*   The market trades into 3:00 PM, reaching half of the 30% and 20% range (25%).
*   A small retracement is followed by an anticipated drive lower.
*   The speaker wants to see if it takes out the low formed in the last hour of trading.
*   A limit order is placed as it goes down, resulting in a fill.
*   The trade is covered at 15280, for a full profit.
*   15357 short, covering at 15280.

## **TGIF: Defining the Pattern and Setup**

*   TGIF (Thank God It's Friday) uses 20-30% of the weekly range as the draw on liquidity on a Friday.
*   If there wasn't a Judas Swing at the 9:30 AM market open on Friday and it rallied higher without reversing, the high of the week could form during lunchtime or between 1:30 PM and 2:00 PM.
*   One of two scenarios will occur: either a Judas Swing forms at the open on Friday, or it forms later in the day.

### **Bearish Expectations and Range Targeting**

*   If bearish, anticipate a pullback into 20-30% of the weekly range, assuming the weekly range has been trending upwards.
*   Expect a false run at the open to lure traders into buying before trapping them near the high and driving the price lower into the 20-30% range.

### **Analyzing Range Proximity and Static Rules**

*   The speaker notes how close the market got to 30% of the weekly range.
*   Static rules can be applied to the 20-30% range of the weekly range, creating gradients.
*   The low, lower 25%, half, and upper 25% can be used.
*   A partial can be taken as it touches 20%, with another partial at the upper gradient level.
*   If it reaches 50%, most of the trade can be taken off, with the stop rolled to the most recent swing high.
*   The trade would have reached the next gradient level.

### **Trade Management and Market Dynamics**

*   The speaker chose to wait to see the low that formed in the last hour.
*   The retracement was comfortable, anticipating a rip lower to take out that low.
*   Trading to 30% wasn't necessary.
*   The speaker used the low that formed, allowing traders to think it was established.

### **Dispelling Misconceptions**

*   The "345/350 algorithm" is not an algorithm but a macro.
*   Without understanding the macro, its actions won't be clear.
*   It was pulling up against short-term buy stops at relative equal highs.
*   Staying within the 20-30% range was reasonable.
*   Attacking the sell side followed after hitting the relative equal highs.

### **Contrasting Perspectives**

*   Traders buying long, thinking they will catch a move into the 4:00 PM hour, are misguided.
*   There's a distinct difference between the speaker's teachings and other YouTube lessons.

### **Call to Action**

*   Study this and review every weekly candle on any market to observe this phenomenon.
*   Multiple potential entry patterns exist using the speaker's teachings.

## **Mastery and Execution**

*   Only one entry model is needed.
*   Ideally, all models should be understood, but few currently know how to do that.
*   Anyone claiming to know everything the speaker has taught would be executing like them, showing evidence and proof for their entries and logic.
*   They are simply familiar with the concepts, not masters of them.

### **Closing Remarks**

*   The speaker has more teachings for the year.
*   The speaker appreciates the audience's time.
*   The speaker wishes everyone safety and well-being.

# Algorithmic Trading with ICT Models: A Deep Dive into Finding Setups for Life

**Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuBRMFhFZAY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuBRMFhFZAY)

This lecture focuses on providing crucial information for finding setups in trading. It's based on questions frequently asked as a Forex and Index Futures mentor, but the principles apply across all asset classes. The goal is to eliminate uncertainty about where to look on charts and when to use Electronic Trading Hours (ETH) versus Regular Trading Hours (RTH), ultimately creating a setup applicable for life.

## Introduction and Expectations

This isn't a lecture on specific patterns or PD arrays. Instead, you'll learn *how* to find your own setups by understanding *when* and *where* they form. This is a constant that many struggling traders overlook. It's about knowing what to look for and when, incorporating Market Profiling using ICT's publicly shared schematics (found in the core content under day trading and market reviews).

**Important Note:** For those seeking a simple "1-2-3 easy" pattern, that material already exists on the YouTube channel. This lecture is for traders seeking a wider range of setups beyond a single strategy, while acknowledging the value of models like the 2022 model and the Optimal Trade Entry pattern.

**Lecture Structure:** This lesson will be to the point, covering details on trade executions. It's presented in a PowerPoint format to maintain focus due to time constraints. The goal is to understand the purpose of this study and what to glean from it.

## Premise: One Trade Setup for Life

The central idea is finding a specific, non-ambiguous setup that repeats consistently.

**Addressing Concerns:** The speaker addresses questions about trade executions appearing "too good to be true" or using delayed data. He is sharing knowledge he felt compelled to share on this specific day.

## Finding *Your* PD Array: The Starting Point

Focus on the PD array that you instinctively see in charts—the one that doesn't require straining your eyes to find. This is your baseline, the one that resonates with you *right now* as a new student. It doesn't have to be your only setup forever, but it's the best place to start.

Understanding one PD array and the principles discussed in this lecture will make it easier to identify other setups. Don't rush the process or place unrealistic time limits on your learning. Learning curves vary, so focus solely on the lesson at hand.

## Liquidity: The Driving Force of Price Delivery

**Key Concept:** Liquidity is the sole purpose of price delivery.

The speaker acknowledges Patrick Wiand for providing a screenshot from his live stream to illustrate a point about liquidity.

### Addressing Tools Like Bookmap

While not affiliated with **Bookmap** (and not suggesting or discouraging its use), the speaker believes its primary function can be made redundant with this lesson. Bookmap is useful for new traders as a crutch but focuses on levels of liquidity that may not be immediately pertinent to current price action or narrative.

**Important:** SMC refers to "Smart Money Concepts" as taught by ICT.

### Misconceptions and Focus

A common complaint is that ICT doesn't clearly explain *why* he picks specific highs or lows. He asserts that this information has always been present in his content, often overlooked because it's embedded within the "boring parts" of the discussion.

**Goal:** This lesson reveals where to focus your attention and *what specific liquidity* ICT refers to. Compare the information with resources like Bookmap to determine its validity.

**Disclaimer:** The speaker does not know if Bookmap offers a free trial, but other YouTubers promote it as affiliates. The key takeaway is that this lesson aims to provide insights into liquidity focus without requiring additional paid resources.

### Scope of Application

The discussion applies to all types of traders: day traders, scalpers, session traders, short-term traders, swing traders, and position traders. These concepts can be used to refine risk models, reduce risk exposure, and time market entries more precisely. Understanding these concepts enhances the ability to predict market movements.

## Identifying Key Areas: PM Session Ranges

### Definition: Previous Day PM Session Range

*   **Time Window:** 1:30 PM to 4:00 PM New York Local Time.
*   **Chart Setup:** Set your TradingView chart to New York Local Time to avoid confusion.

Identify the highest high and lowest low within this timeframe from the *previous* day. This is always referred to in terms of Regular Trading Hours (RTH). Toggle between RTH and Electronic Trading Hours (ETH) on TradingView (if your membership allows). TradingView was chosen because it was the preferred platform for the speaker's community when he departed MT4.

**RTH Importance:** The algorithm references these specific times after the start of regular trading hours.

### Bullish Scenario: Exploiting Sell-Side Liquidity

*   **Orange Line:** The opening bell at 9:30 AM (the start of regular trading for stock indices).
*   If bullish and trading near the opening, expect a run for the high or low.
*   **Ideal Scenario:** If bullish with a higher timeframe premise, anticipate a run *below* the PM session low (sell-side liquidity).

Selling below these lows (1:30 PM to 4:00 PM New York Local Time) presents an opportunity. Smart money accumulates these sell-side liquidity positions for buy-side opportunities. The "Judas Swing" (a drop) goes into this area of liquidity, absorbing it for later buy orders.

**Key Takeaway:** Focus on the previous day's PM session (1:30 PM to 4:00 PM New York Local Time), not just any random high or low. There's liquidity above and below this range.

**Expectation at the Open:** If looking for higher prices, expect a run to the buy-side. At the opening bell, anticipate (but don't always expect) a run *lower* – the Judas Swing that causes many traders to chase the market incorrectly.


# Algorithmic Trading with ICT Models: A Deep Dive into Finding Setups for Life (Continued)

## Exploiting Sell-Side Liquidity: A Bullish Perspective

The speaker explains the anticipated market movement when price action indicates a bullish sentiment.

*   "Going lower, no, no, no, no, it's only running down there to take sellers into the marketplace, and they're going to buy them, and then the market runs to the buy side."
*   A trader might consider taking a long position at this point.

    *   Requires a significant amount of conviction.
    *   Trusting the concept of buying below old lows and selling above old highs for entries (not targets) can be challenging initially.
    *   It requires a paradigm shift in thinking to anticipate these levels as entries.
*   **How to Gain Confidence:**

    *   Study old moves.
    *   Journal your observations.
*   **Simplified Model:**

    *   If bullish, wait for the sell-side to form within the previous PM session range. This is your buy signal.
    *   This implies an expectation of the weekly range expanding higher, targeting higher liquidity on the weekly timeframe.
*   **Anticipating Buy-Side Targets:**

    *   The market runs for the buy-side liquidity.
    *   Focus on specific highs within the 1:30 PM to 4:00 PM range.
*   **Recap:** It's not complicated, despite being taught repeatedly.

    *   The lesson is designed to eliminate any confusion.

## 24-Hour Market Rotation: The ICT Perspective

The speaker transitions to analyzing market behavior over a 24-hour period.

*   **ICT's Routine:**

    1.  Evaluate the PM session range.
    2.  If the price isn't in close proximity to the PM session range (1:30 PM to 4:00 PM) at 9:30 AM (opening bell), consider the London session raid.
*   **London Session Raid:**

    *   Time window: 2:00 AM to 5:00 AM New York local time.
    *   Annotate these levels on your charts.
        *   Manual annotation (high-touch) is preferred over automated indicators (high-tech).
        *   It encourages more thoughtful analysis.
*   **Analyzing London Session Raids with PM Session Context:**

    *   If the market isn't close to the previous PM session at 9:30 AM, look to the London session.
    *   Example:

        *   The market is near the London session buy-side liquidity pre-9:30 AM.
        *   This can be interpreted as a "Judas Swing."
        *   Remember to use Electronic Trading Hours (ETH) to see overnight trading.
        *   Otherwise, this information remains hidden when toggled to Regular Trading Hours.
*   **Utilizing London Session Information:**

    *   Identify the highest high and lowest low within the 2:00 AM to 5:00 AM range.
    *   If the buy-side has been raided:
        *   Anticipate a false run higher.
        *   Look for a shift lower.
    *   Tools for Identifying the Shift:

        *   2022 Model.
        *   Bearish Breaker.
        *   ICT Optimal Trade Entry (OTE).
        *   Fair Value Gap (FVG).
        *   Aim for London session sell-side liquidity.
    *   A retracement may be necessary.

        *   This retracement also forms a range that can be used intraday.
*   **Trading Day Routine:**

    1.  Open at 9:30 AM.
    2.  Wait 30 minutes for a potential run higher or lower or consolidation.
    3.  Wait for the 10:00 AM displacement.
    4.  Look for a silver bullet between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM.
    5.  Consider a run into the lunch macro (covered in future lessons).
*   **Two Key Ranges for Liquidity:** The PM session range and the London session range.

## Integrating Bookmap and ICT Concepts

The speaker revisits the earlier discussion of Bookmap and its potential utility.

*   **Bookmap and Liquidity:**

    *   Compare Bookmap's liquidity depictions with the levels taught in the lesson.
    *   If Bookmap's data aligns with the concepts being taught, then it validates the information.
    *   Focus on the major levels of liquidity taught in the lesson.
*   **Consistency and Accuracy:**

    *   The speaker references his consistent and accurate market calls on Twitter.
    *   This accuracy stems from the methods taught in this lesson.
*   **Actionable Steps for Traders:**

    *   If market direction isn't clear, refrain from trading.
    *   Instead, study the market.
    *   Journal your observations.
        *   Include chart annotations.
        *   This training and conditioning is key for your brain and subconscious to adapt to these concepts.
        *   It activates your reticular activating system.
        *   This will allow you to recognize key highs and lows.
*   **Important Note:**

    *   The methodology isn't based on supply and demand or Wyckoff.
    *   The material is unique to ICT's teachings.

## Opening Range Gaps: Definition and Application

The discussion shifts to the concept of opening range gaps.

*   **Opening Range Gaps Defined:** A specific event related to Regular Trading Hours (RTH).
*   **TradingView Setup:**

    *   Ensure you're toggled to Regular Trading Hours (RTH) to remove overnight trading.
    *   The separation between the close of the previous day's RTH session and the opening at 9:30 AM is the opening range gap.
*   **Distinction:** Not to be confused with the opening range, which is the first 30 minutes of trading (9:30 AM to 10:00 AM New York Local Time).
*   **Opening Range Gap Characteristics:**

    *   If there is a gap lower at 9:30 AM, it will be visible on the chart.
    *   Represented with an orange box.
    *   It doesn't necessarily mean the price will immediately run up to fill the gap.
*   **ICT's Perspective on Gaps:**

    *   ICT didn't invent gaps.
    *   He has refined how to use them effectively.
*   **Tonight's Focus:** Where the market reaches for liquidity and its subsequent targets.
*   **Example Scenario:**

    *   A low forms in the AM session (9:30 AM to noon).
    *   Below that low resides sell-side liquidity (sell stops).
    *   If the market gaps lower, it will run into that liquidity.
*   **Filtering Overnight Price Action:**

    *   When referring to the opening range gap, overnight price action is disregarded.
*   **Identifying Key Lows:**

    *   On a regular trading hours chart, lows are typically obvious.
*   **Methodology:**

    *   There's a method behind picking specific highs and lows.
    *   The methods are consistent and repeatable.

## Combining Opening Range Gaps, Liquidity, and Time

The speaker synthesizes several concepts to improve trade decision-making.

*   **Scenario:**

    *   The market runs to a pool of liquidity (e.g., inside of liquidity below old lows).
    *   It's now in a discount and in sell-side liquidity.
    *   Consider the economic calendar (e.g., Fed Chair Powell's testimony).
    *   **Guidance:** Avoid trading around Fed chair testimonies, especially if you're a new trader.
    *   Wait for the PM session (1:30 PM to 4:00 PM New York Local Time).
    *   The probabilities are higher during this time.
*   **Example Continued:**

    *   A low forms around 1:00 PM, then another at 1:30 PM.
    *   After the 1:30 PM low, the price runs up into the opening range gap.
*   **Avoiding Noise:**

    *   Ignore patterns and information from social media traders during periods of liquidity seeking.
    *   Focus on the "sweet spots" in the marketplace.
    *   Retail traders typically react after the fact.
    *   Focus on the logic shared by ICT.
*   **Conclusion:**

    *   The market runs up into the opening range gap after the New York lunch/morning session chop.
    *   This run targets a logical level based on the information taught.
*   **Time as a Factor:**

    *   The algorithm runs on time.
    *   It engineers liquidity in the morning session and during lunch.
    *   It then runs on that liquidity.
*   **Historical Context: Pre-Electronic Trading:**
    *   Describes the process of placing orders through brokers in the "old days."
    *   The speaker would have to contact brokers and wait for his fill.


# Algorithmic Trading with ICT Models: A Deep Dive into Finding Setups for Life (Continued)

## Historical Context: Pre-Electronic Trading and the Lunch Hour

*   The speaker notes that traders are now "spoiled" by the ease of pressing a button to enter trades, contrasting it with the past.
*   Describes the "old days" of open outcry in the pits and the typical **lunch hour** routine.
*   During the lunch hour (**noon to 1:00 PM New York local time**), markets would generally consolidate unless it was a strong trending day.

    *   **Reversal Profile:** In many cases, whatever happened in the morning would be completely reversed after lunch.
    *   **Trending Day Profile:** If it was a trending day, the market would repeat the morning's low up to the lunch high, then continue until 3:00-4:00 PM for the full daily range.
    *   **Bullish Day Profile:** The market would rise, consolidate during lunch (12:00-1:00 PM), and repeat the morning move in the afternoon (2:00-4:00 PM), potentially in half the time, creating a measured move (ABCD).
    *   **Bearish Day Profile:** The market would create the morning move, consolidate during lunch, and do nothing further.
*   The speaker emphasizes that this is how he became ICT and is providing this historical context for reference.

## Modern Application: Integrating Economic Calendar and Liquidity

*   To determine which profile to expect, traders must consider:

    *   **Economic Calendar:** Understanding scheduled economic events.
    *   **Draw on Liquidity:** Identifying where the weekly range is targeting.
*   The speaker stresses the importance of individual study to understand and implement these concepts.
*   **Guidance:** He states that he provides advanced notice and takes viewers to higher timeframe weekly charts, indicating where the market is likely to move.

    *   The speaker indicates that movements can be thousands of points, providing opportunities to align with the market.
    *   The trader does not have to get the lowest low or highest high.

## New York Lunch Raid: Defining the Range

*   The speaker defines a **New York lunch raid** as occurring between **noon and 1:30 PM New York local time**.

    *   He acknowledges the apparent contradiction, as he previously stated the lunch hour was from noon to 1:00 PM.
*   **Clarification:** He states the afternoon macro starts at 1:30 PM.
*   **Countering Skepticism:** The speaker addresses the argument that "the market doesn't care about lunch" and that "the algorithm doesn't take lunch."

    *   **ICT's Stance:** The algorithm operates on the liquidity available during this time.
*   Explains that **Market Manipulation** has existed since the dawn of the Market.
*   He states that Engineering of Market Direction was made much more efficient when electronic trading took over.
*   The speaker says we are not talking about dealers, we are talking about market makers.

## Algorithmic Efficiency: The Modern Market Maker

*   Describes how market manipulation has evolved with electronic trading:

    *   It's now algorithmic and highly efficient.
    *   The algorithm never gets sick or makes mistakes.
    *   It follows code and instructions precisely.
*   **Lunch Run on Liquidity:** It is essential to define the range between 12:00 and 1:30 PM.
*   **Afternoon Macro:** The afternoon macro, a short order of instructions creating a price event, starts at 1:30 PM.
*   The focus should be on the **highest high and lowest low** within this range.

    *   Example: Identifying the highest high between 12:00 and 1:00 PM and the lowest low between 12:00 and 1:30 PM.

## Navigating Market Noise During Lunch

*   **Strategy:** If expecting bullish price action and the market hasn't moved much in the morning, and there is an afternoon event (e.g., FOMC), avoid the morning session.

    *   Let other traders chase opinions on social media.
*   **Focus:** Trailblaze your own path using the information provided.
*   **Goal:** To become self-sufficient, confident, and not reliant on memberships or external opinions.
*   **Session High and Low:** The session high and session low for lunch are technically within a 90-minute window.
*   **Anticipation:** When expecting the market to move higher, anticipate the market dropping to take out New York lunch lows.

## Integrating Market Structure and Time

*   **Trading Strategy:**
    *   Wait for a shift in market structure and look for a Fair Value Gap (FVG).
    *   Don't rely solely on the five-minute chart.
*   **Time-Based Charts:**
    *   Price is price, and inefficiencies are visible on any time-based chart.
    *   Retail traders commonly use 15-minute, hourly, and four-hour charts, creating a taboo around lower timeframes.
    *   Do not heed naysayers saying not to use a time based chart.
*   **Algorithmic Delivery:**
    *   It runs on time, making time the primary factor.
    *   The speaker emphasizes specific time windows and liquidity references.

## Learning Commitment and Bearish/Bullish Scenarios

*   **Learning Curve:** The speaker acknowledges that learning these concepts takes time, patience, and repeated study.
*   **Bearish Scenario:**
    *   Wait for a run-up into the opening range gap, taking out a lunch buy-side liquidity pool.
    *   Observe how the market trades back below the New York lunch high and watch for a displacement.

## Displacement and the 2022 Model

*   **Displacement:** The speaker makes a point of explaining Displacement.
*   **2022 Model:**
    *   Identifies a candle's high and low, indicating a potential selling opportunity.
    *   Aim for the New York lunch low as a target.
*   **Afternoon Session:**
    *   The 90-minute lunch window often sees sell-side liquidity raided during the PM session.
*   **Targeting Liquidity:**
    *   Before reaching relative equal lows, look for the next logical liquidity target: the lunch hour (90-minute period).

## Addressing Critics and Emphasizing Practicality

*   **Addressing Critics:** The speaker addresses potential criticism, emphasizing that he's communicating as a friend, not talking down to anyone.
*   **Student Results:** He acknowledges that while he can create profitable traders, some students are lazy and make excuses for their failures.
*   **Advantage:** He emphasizes that viewers have a significant advantage after this lesson by focusing on what he's looking for.
*   **AM Session Ranges:** from 9:30 in the morning to noon.
*   **Referencing the Afternoon:** traders can always refer to the morning session in the afternoon of the same trading day, anticipating a market reversal profile.

## Market Profiles and Liquidity Pools

*   **Elongated Market:** If the New York morning session is consolidation, and the lunch hour is directional, refer to previous sessions.
*   **Previous Session Analysis (Bearish):**
    *   When bearish and using electronic trading, focus on specific lows.
    *   Look at the 9:30 AM to noon range, bypassing the PM session range if already trading below it.
    *   Focus on the AM session sell-side liquidity.
*   **Bullish Scenario:** The opposite of the above.
*   **Chart Settings:** Whether using regular or electronic trading hours, focus on specific liquidity pools and time.
*   **Consistency:** The speaker stresses the consistency of his logic, even when adapting to different market profiles.
*   **Anticipation vs. Reaction:** He emphasizes anticipating market movements based on his teachings.
## Practical Application and Recap
*   **Learning Commitment:** The speaker does not anticipate you knowing everything after one viewing.
*   **Repeated Study:** Reiterates the importance of repeated study of the concepts taught and going back through charts.
*   **Conviction:** the repeated study will give you conviction that the logic is sound and the way the market works every week and every day.
*   **AM Session Lows:** The speaker states the need to be specific about previous AM session lows and the sell-side liquidity.
*   **Time is Key:** he does not care about overnight highs and lows, he is looking at very specific regular trading hours that will be respected or blown out.
*   **Blending Techniques:** The speaker transitions to a chart, the E-mini S&P to look at on the 21st of June 2023.
*   **Opening Range:** The speaker also utilized the opening range in the PM session trade.
*   **10 O'Clock Testimony:** The speaker was watching Fed Chair Pal's testimony at 10 o'clock.
*   **Sideways Churn:** The market was churning sideways, beating up everybody and traders must wait till after lunch.
*   **The Cleanest Setup:** Waiting till lunch will get you the cleanest setup of the day, and will be a very obvious set up.


# Algorithmic Trading with ICT Models: A Deep Dive into Finding Setups for Life (Continued)

## Avoiding Action Hound Mentality and Account Blow-Up

*   The speaker emphasizes that he doesn't want students to become "action hounds" trying to trade everything.
*   **Account Failure:** Students who blow their accounts or fail funded account challenges exhibit this characteristic.

*   **Opening Range Gap Example:** The opening range gap was used to achieve a potential profit of $9,362 before commissions.
*   **Respectable Profit:** The speaker highlights that nearly $10,000 is a significant amount, enough for a vacation, a gift for a spouse, or Christmas shopping.
*   **Think Logically:** Focus on the logic being presented.
*   **Ignore the Noise:** Ignore comments like "Pal 10 o'clock trash Market."

## The Pitfalls of Being a "Neoy Trader"

*   **Neoy Trader Trap:** The speaker cautions against feeling the need to constantly trade, a characteristic of a "neoy trader."
*   **Experience Matters:** With 30 years of experience, he asserts that constant trading is unnecessary.
*   **Liberating Relaxation:** It's liberating to relax and acknowledge the high degree of manipulation in the market.
*   **Unpredictable Manipulation:** Manual intervention can cause unpredictable price movements, making it impossible to foresee.
*   **Avoid Torture:** Don't torture yourself trying to predict the unpredictable.
*   **Alternative Activities:** Engage in other activities like sleeping in, having breakfast with your spouse, working out, or pursuing hobbies.
*   **Shift Start:** The trading shift starts at **1:30 PM**, when the macro begins to run.

## New York Lunch Sell-Side Liquidity

*   **Market Behavior:** At 1:30, the market creates a low and trades below the New York lunch sell-side liquidity.
*   **Potential Sweep:** The market may sweep it again.
*   **No Requirement:** It's not required for the market to take out that low.
*   **Bullish Order Block:** A rally comes back down into a down-close candle, which is a bullish order block. (Note: The speaker isn't teaching order blocks in this lecture).
*   **Displacement and Fair Value Gaps:** The market rallies, creating displacement and fair value gaps.

## 15-Second Chart Example

*   **Example:** The speaker promises to show a 15-second chart demonstrating his strategy.
*   **Anticipation:** He anticipated the market dropping below the initial New York lunch sell-side liquidity and then moving up into the opening range gap.
*   **Low-Hanging Fruit:** The focus is on teaching the "low-hanging fruit," the easiest objective to learn initially.
*   **Modular Learning:** Learning should be modular, step by step.
*   **Pyramiding:** Students aren't yet ready for the pyramiding techniques he uses.

## Developing Independence

*   **Growth & Timing:** Students should develop independently from his personal timing.
*   **Realistic Mentorship:** He aims to be a realistic mentor, not someone who promises instant expertise.
*   **Terminus:** The "terminus" (target) for new learners is the easiest low-hanging fruit objective.

## Buying Scenario Based on Sell-Side Liquidity Sweep

*   **Buy Premise:** Buying occurs under the premise that the sell-side liquidity pool for lunch has been swept.
*   **Rejection of Low:** The market shows a willingness to repel back above the low, denying further downward movement.
*   **Ignoring Other Lows:** The focus is on looking past other lows to the specific low in question.
*   **PM Session Confirmation:** The low isn't taken out until the PM session.

## Addressing Potential Trade Failure and Transparency

*   **Potential for Error:** The speaker acknowledges that he sometimes makes mistakes and gets stopped out.
*   **Re-entry:** If the trade remains valid, he re-enters.
*   **Transparency:** He shares both successful and unsuccessful trades on Twitter.
*   **Trust:** The speaker stresses trusting the validity of the set up.

## Smart Money Accumulation and Targeting

*   **Rejection Block:** The market trades below the rejection block (lowest closing price in the swing).
*   **Accumulation:** He anticipates accumulation and smart money entering the market.
*   **Target:** The target is relative equal highs and, more specifically, the opening range from regular trading hours (4222.5).
*   **Runner:** He could have aimed for one tick below the high of the opening range gap, but it's not necessary.
*   **Avoiding Pressure:** He avoids setting unrealistic expectations for his students.

## Practicality and the "Low-Hanging Fruit" Approach

*   **Realistic Expectations:** It's unrealistic to expect the same results as someone with 30 years of experience in a short period.
*   **Focus on Logic:** If the market has taken sell-side liquidity, the afternoon should see a run-up into the gap.
*   **Deep Discount:** They traded into the previous session AM lows.
*   **Unfilled Gap:** The opening range gap hasn't been traded into since the open.
*   **Lunch Buy-Side Liquidity:** Relative equal highs created between 12:00 and 1:30 constitute lunch buy-side liquidity.
*   **Stop Losses:** Everyone shorting has their stop losses there.
*   **Deep Pockets:** Large funds with "Deep Pockets" are buying.

## 15-Second Chart Entries and Profit Taking

*   **15-Second Entries:** Every entry was based on a 15-second candle (demonstrated on a one-minute chart).
*   **Partial Profits:** Partial profits are taken above relative equal highs.
*   **No Requirement for Top:** He doesn't require the market to trade above the opening range gap high.

## Mindset and Avoiding Toxic Thinking

*   **Mimicking Success:** If you mimic the trade and profit $9,362, don't beat yourself up for not reaching the opening range gap high.
*   **Toxic Mindset:** Such thinking is toxic and detrimental.
*   **Filter Negativity:** Actively filter out negative thinking.

## The Dangers of Social Media for Developing Traders

*   **Social Media as Cancer:** Social media can be detrimental for developing students due to ego-driven competition.
*   **Focus on Learning:** The goal is to learn how to make money and stay in the game long enough to develop skills.
*   **Leaving the 9-5:** The ultimate aim is to leave your job and live life on your own terms.

## Leaving a Legacy and the Importance of Graduation

*   **Legacy:** The speaker is leaving a legacy of information for future generations.
*   **Graduation:** You need to "graduate" in your understanding and be realistic about market movements.
*   **Runner Strategy:** Leave a "runner" on only when you have a strong conviction about where the market is going.
*   **Internal Dialogue:** The worst that can happen when leaving a runner on is getting stopped out in profit.

## The Impact of Trading in Front of an Audience

*   **Applying Prior Knowledge:** The speaker emphasizes that he's using the concepts taught earlier in the presentation.
*   **Real-Time Annotation:** He's annotating the chart in real-time, showing reference points and explaining why the market should behave in a certain way.


# Algorithmic Trading with ICT Models: A Deep Dive into Finding Setups for Life (Continued)

## Understanding the 15-Second Chart and Lunch Macro

*   **Expertise Required:** You must thoroughly understand the concepts to annotate the chart, identify respected levels, and predict market movements.
*   **Beyond the Timeframe:** Forget the 15-second timeframe that everyone else on Twitter is using.
*   **Lunch Macro Focus:** Focus on the lunch macro, where the market runs down to the sell-side and then returns to the opening range gap to target the buy-side on the New York lunch high.
*   **PD Arrays:** Use every discount PD array as a potential entry point based on the teachings, even on a 15-second chart.

## Multiple Timeframe Analysis and Entry Opportunities

*   **Higher Timeframes, Fewer Entries:** Higher timeframes (1-minute, 2-minute, 3-minute, 4-minute, 5-minute, or 15-minute charts) offer fewer entry opportunities.
*   **Overkill Demonstration:** The speaker uses ultra-short-term timeframes to "rub their nose in it" for those who claim his strategies are fake.
*   **Commitment Required:** This requires a lifestyle commitment involving deep study and passion.
*   **Real Order Flow:** None of the things he showed violated any of the bullish order flow.

## Long Position Example and Pyramiding

*   **Long Entry:** The speaker goes long on the S&P, noting the run that didn't take out the 1:00 low.
*   **Pyramiding:** He's adding to his position (pyramiding).
*   **Inversion Fair Value Gap:** The speaker has already annotated the chart and identified a fair value gap that will act as support, anticipating a rally to the buy-side.
*   **Order Block Reclaim:** The order block is reclaimed, digging into the inversion fair value gap.
*   **Dynamic Support:** The fair value gap is expected to act as dynamic support.
*   **Stop Loss Placement:** The stop loss is placed below the inversion fair value gap.

## Trade Management and Execution

*   **Real-Time Execution:** The speaker emphasizes that this is not replay, but real-time trading.
*   **Partial Profits:** He takes partial profits and keeps his stop loss below the 4416 low.
*   **Avoid Inefficiency:** He avoids placing the stop loss too close to the price to account for potential retracements.
*   **Limit Order Execution:** A 10-lot limit order is filled, reducing the position to five remaining.
*   **Buy-Side Target:** The market runs for the buy-side.
*   **Trailing Stop Loss:** The speaker plans to trail his stop loss once the high is reached.

## Transparency and Logic

*   **Twitter Confirmation:** Everything shared was also posted on Twitter.
*   **Underlying Logic:** The trading decisions are based on the principles taught in the lecture.
*   **PM Session Focus:** As advised in the morning, he waited for the PM session to execute the trade.

*   **Contextual Entry:** PD arrays can be used for entries, but only with a clear narrative and understanding of liquidity targets.
*   **Weekly Candle Guidance:** The weekly candle indicates where the market is likely to gravitate.
*   **Harmonic Pattern Integration:** These concepts can enhance other trading styles, like harmonic patterns.
*   **Retail Concept Transformation:** Retail concepts can be made to work when combined with this understanding.

## Contrarian Approach and Psychological Warfare

*   **Retail Trader Mindset:** Retail traders often seek patterns and indicators to cut through market noise.
*   **Price Action Understanding:** Understanding *why* price moves is crucial.
*   **Time and Price Basis:** Price moves based on time and price.
*   **Setup for Life:** The combination of time and price provides a setup for life.

## Addressing Doubters and Sharing Knowledge

*   **Inversion Fair Value Gap Confirmation:** The speaker highlights the reality of inversion fair value gaps, demonstrating it on a 15-second chart.
*   **Liquidity and Time/Price Understanding:** Understanding liquidity and time/price dynamics makes it predictable.
*   **Lunch Hour Algorithm:** The algorithm runs on lunch hour liquidity, then reprices to the next liquidity pool.
*   **Price Movement Reasons:** Price goes up to take buy-side liquidity (buy stops) or to an inefficiency above market price.
*   **Economic Calendar and Consolidation:** The economic calendar indicates consolidation periods.
*   **Weekly Chart Direction:** The weekly chart indicates potential targets (fair value gaps or liquidity).
*   **Embrace Losses:** Losses are inevitable and create new opportunities.

## Challenging Conventional Trading Wisdom

*   **Challenging "Clowns":** The speaker criticizes those who perpetuate outdated and ineffective trading methods.
*   **Personal Authority:** He asserts his authority based on his extensive experience and understanding.
*   **Freedom of Entry Model:** Traders are free to choose their entry model (order block, fair value gap, etc.) based on this knowledge.
*   **Economic Calendar Influence:** The speaker highlights the importance of the economic calendar, pointing out that he teaches when the market consolidates, which in turn influences the other key actions of the market (up or down).


# Algorithmic Trading with ICT Models: A Deep Dive into Finding Setups for Life (Continued)

## Understanding ICT Concepts and Resources

*   **Consequent Encroachment & Wick Analysis:** Understanding the consequent encroachment of a wick is crucial.
*   **Individual Responsibility:** These concepts are in your hands, and you must study and understand them.
*   **Starting Point Recommendation:** If you're new, begin with the **2022 mentorship**, which consists of **41 videos**.
    *   This will provide the shortest route to finding something that works every single day.
*   **Universality of Models:** The models work every day across various markets.
    *   However, a specific setup may not be present in *every* market you're watching *right now*.
    *   The model is present in *every single one* of these markets
*   **Index Trading Application:** If you're an index trader, the setup will be present in one index. It might be in multiple, but possibly only one.
    *   That's why you should look at all three averages: **Dow, NASDAQ, and S&P**.
*   **Forex Trading Application:** It may not be in the Pound, but it *is* in the Euro.
    *   Intermarket relationships must be considered.

## Intermarket Relationships and Forex Triads

*   **Closely Correlated Markets:** Study closely correlated markets such as **Euro and Cable (Euro/USD and GBP/USD)**.
*   **Inverse Correlation with the Dollar:** Euro and Cable are inversely correlated with the Dollar. When the Dollar goes up, they go down.
*   **Nuances in Correlation:** Just because the Dollar is going down *doesn't* mean it's a good buy for the Euro.
    *   Sometimes Cable is a better buy than the Euro.
    *   Most of the time, its better in cable.
*   **Dollar Consolidation Scenario:** When the Dollar is going sideways, the Euro or Cable may outperform the other.
    *   This means the real trade might be in an exotic pair.
    *   For instance, if the Pound/Dollar is poised to rise more when the Dollar consolidates, then a long position in Pound/Yen might be a good trade.
    *   Consider this and study lessons on core content related to this.

## Future Content Availability and Learning Pace

*   **Content Retention:** Videos on this YouTube channel will *not* be removed after November.
*   **No Further Updates:** There will be no new content or updates after November.
*   **Sufficient Content:** More than enough content is available for your needs.
*   **Self-Paced Learning:** Study at your own pace. Rushing will only lengthen the learning curve.
*   **No Speed Learning:** This can't be speed-learned.
*   **Condensed Content Claims Debunked:** Dismiss claims of condensing ICT's teachings into shorter, more efficient formats.
    *   Condensing the information results in missing critical details.
    *   The nuances are often overlooked when rushing through the material.
    *   Those that condense miss so much information
*   **Appreciating the Content:** The full value of the content becomes apparent with real-money trading experience.

## Experiential Learning and Emotional Connection

*   **Real-Money Trading Impact:** The lessons become much more meaningful when trading with real money.
*   **Deeper Understanding:** "Droning discussions" and "jaw boning" will resonate more when you're prepared to hear it.
*   **Personal Connection:** "I'm talking to my children"; this content is intended for future generations.
*   **Legacy Building:** Similar to the movie with Michael Keaton, this is creating a legacy.
*   **Posthumous Resource:** After I'm gone, they'll have all this to listen to, and compare and contrast with notes I have for Enigma.

## Enigma Discussion

*   **Enigma Exclusivity:** Enigma is not taught in these presentations.
*   **No Cracking Enigma:** No one has figured out Enigma.
*   **Imitation vs. Reality:** What others call "Enigma" isn't even close.
*   **"I am Enigma."**

## Closing Remarks

*   **Appreciation:** Thank you for hanging out with me tonight,
*   **Video Engagement:** Give a thumbs up on the video (doesn't cost anything).
*   **Encouragement:** Your engagement encourages me to come back and do more like this.
*   **Farewell:** I'll talk to you next time, be safe.

# Market Review and Analysis (Saturday)

## Introduction

Good afternoon, folks. Happy Saturday! This is a market review, and I'll try to keep it concise.

## Dollar Index Analysis

### Weekly Chart Analysis

*   **Fair Value Gap (FVG):** There is a fair value gap present on the weekly chart, remaining from last week's trading activity, represented by the weekly candle.
    *   The key focus is whether this level holds as **resistance**.
    *   Observing the market reaction upon touching this level is crucial.
*   **Potential Scenarios:**
    *   **Scenario 1 (Breaching Resistance):** If the price moves above the FVG and subsequently returns *into* it, it is expected to act as **support**.
        *   Potential target: **Rejection Block** (highest up-close price) and eventually the high with the consequent encroachment of that wick.
    *   A patient approach is needed, awaiting **Sunday's opening** and allowing **Monday's trading** to unfold.
    *   **Global events** are significant, and awareness of news headlines is vital to avoid surprises.

### Daily Chart Analysis

*   **Weekly FVG on Daily Chart:** While the weekly FVG is prominent on the weekly chart, it's not immediately apparent as an imbalance on the daily candlestick chart.
*   **Support and Rally:**
    *   Previous support was found off the FVG (mentioned in earlier commentaries). Review past commentaries for reference.
    *   The area to watch was a **volume imbalance**.
    *   On Thursday, the market traded down into that volume imbalance, rallying up into the consequent encroachment of the wick.
*   **Monday's Trading:** A cautious approach is advised, keeping strategies confidential.
*   **Volatility:** High volatility is expected next week.

## Euro Dollar Analysis

### Weekly Chart Imbalance

*   **Weekly Imbalance:** There is a weekly imbalance present; users are encouraged to analyze this on their own charts.
    *   Avoid overwhelming the chart with too many indicators.
    *   This allows for individual investigation.
*   **Identification Technique:**
    *   Place a rectangle on the daily chart, extending from the low to the high of a specific candle.
    *   Refer to the weekly chart for clear visualization of the weekly FVG.

### Impact of Closing Price & Agricultural Issues

*   **Fair Value Gap Formation:** The FVG has formed due to the leak in the closing price.
    *   The question is whether the price will move above the weekly FVG and establish it as active support.
*   **Agricultural Concerns:**
    *   **Drought:** Issues exist with crops (corn, wheat, and soybeans) due to the current drought conditions.
    *   **Grain Market Impact:** This is expected to be bullish for grain prices.
    *   **Dollar Index Correlation:** This is usually correlated with a consolidating or lower dollar index.
*   **War in Ukraine:** Added uncertainty from the ongoing war needs consideration.

### Trading Strategy

*   **Current Approach:** Focus on **day trading** due to market uncertainties.
    *   Avoid longer-term analysis.
    *   Focus on intraday trading (morning, afternoon, and London sessions).

### Hourly Chart Analysis

*   **Model 2022:** A specific pattern is highlighted.
    *   **Buy-Side Liquidity:** A run above buy-side liquidity, followed by a shift in market structure (right there).
    *   **Rally & Entry:** Rally back up, entry point based on the 2022 Model.
    *   **Drawdown:** A drop down into an imbalance for a perfect 2022 model setup.
*   **Order Block:** Market trades all the act down into this low; a close look reveals a passing imbalance (buy-side inefficiency) within an order block, leading to a rally.
*   **Potential Scenarios**
    *   For bulls: Price must get back above the weekly FVG, find support, and rally.
    *   Otherwise: The possibility of dollar consolidation and a run for Euro sell-side liquidity exists.
*   **Weekly FVG Detail:** A deeper examination of the newly formed weekly FVG in a specific timeframe.
*   **Shift in Market Structure:** Noticeable after buy-side is taken.
*   **Optimal Trade Entry:** After imbalance selloff.
*   **Sell-Side Liquidity:** Frequently go for liquidity

### Breakaway Gap

*   **Definition:** A breakaway gap occurs near a swing high or low (in this case, moving lower).
*   **Strategy:**
    *   Optimal strategy to enter, expecting the price to drop.
    *   An aggressive drop is a positive sign.
    *   The gap should *not* be filled.
    *   Target: 108.45s.

## E-Mini S&P (ES) Analysis

### Weekly Chart

*   **Inefficiency:** We had our inefficiency here.
*   **Old High and Buy-Side Liquidity:** All mentioned elements should be repriced within the current structure (city = sell-side inefficiency).
*   **Volume Imbalance:** Volume imbalance suggests further upward movement in the coming week or later.
*   **Comparison to NASDAQ:**
    *   While NASDAQ has already reached its equivalent volume imbalance area, the ES only traded up into its sell-side inefficiency.

### Hourly Chart

*   **Regular Trading Hours (RTH) Chart:** Displayed in regular trading hours.
*   **Buy-Side Liquidity:** Price initially moves up to take buy-side liquidity outside the old inefficiency.
*   **Break Lower:** Price then breaks lower.
*   **Volume Imbalance:** Heavy volume imbalance.
*   **Liquidity Void:** A genuine liquidity void exists with minimal trading activity.
*   **Opening Range Gaps:** These gaps represent the difference between the closing price of one session (CNBC bell) and the opening price of the next (9:30 AM).
    *   Opening range gap, price trades up into it, treats it as resistance, and sells off.
    *   Opening range gaps occur for Thursday and Friday trading sessions.

### Opening Range Gaps - Continued

*   **Opening Range Gap Example:** A clear opening range gap forms, price trades into it on the 21st, and then breaks lower.
*   **Expiration:** A personal rule is that opening range gaps are only considered valid for five days.
    *   Beyond this, their relevance as support or resistance diminishes.
    *   **Exception:** New week opening gaps can be considered for months.
*   **Opening range gaps are short-term imbalances with an expiration date of five days.**

### Five Minute Chart Analysis

*   **Opening Range Measurement:** From settlement price to opening at 9:30 AM.
*   **50% Level:** The 50% level of the opening range gap is highlighted.
*   **Market Activity:**
    *   Price trades above short-term high during the morning session.
    *   Price drops back down to the opening price (9:30 AM).
    *   Price rallies to reach for buy-side liquidity and reprice into opening range gap.
    *   Full closure might not occur due to order flow.

### Daily Fair Value Gap (FVG) on ES

*   The user sent a tweet out on Friday morning about being interested in it, and the topic shifts into the information that will be shown later.
*   From Noon to 1:30, Price runs by-side.
*   The discount favored by the user was traded into by one tick.

### Noon to 1:30 PM (New York Lunch)

*   **Lunchtime Analysis:** Recent teaching on using this timeframe with a directional bias toward higher timeframe key levels.
*   **Friday Morning Bias:** A lower fair value gap on the ES chart was favored.
*   **Market Action:**
    *   The price rallies during lunch, taking buy-side liquidity.
    *   Price trades into half of the opening range gap.
    *   Consolidation occurs.
    *   The price runs into the mean threshold of a short-term order block.
*   **Behavior:** Note how it was used as support, and rallied.
*   **Inversion:** The market structure has an inversion application.

### Classical Support and Resistance

*   Classic Support and Resistance looks at the low and will draw a line on that time and price; but this doesn't stop there and consolidates and rips through it.
*   The ability to interpret order flow and market structure using specific, finite levels.
*   **Rules:** Specific rules exist that you must adhere to, which are learned throughout the year.
*   The market trolls anyone that was short in the big gap down with electronic trading hour.
*   **Eliminating Guesswork:** Get a range on that opening range gap.
*   With it being Friday, it is likely to draw down into its daily fair value gap.
*   It is only pulled back to give a short-term premium.

### Market Breaks Lower

*   Breaks lower into the opening range gap low and targets the daily fair value gap.
*   **Coloration:** Discoloration on the chart shows the framework for the Silver Bullet AM and PM sessions.

### Silver Bullet Framework (AM Session)

*   **50% Levels:**
    *   50% of the order block and convergence of the opening range.
    *   Dashed line represents 50% of the opening range gap.
*   **Silver Bullet Time:** 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM.
*   **Directional Bias:** Bearish (favored lower end).
*   **Gap and Entry:** Price trades up into a gap, with a small fair value gap on the one-minute chart.
*   **Drawdown:** Minimal drawdown.
*   **Rules:** Enter between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM.
*   **Exit:** Targets the low end of the opening range gap (approximately 10 handles, though only five are needed for a Silver Bullet).

### Lunch and PM Session

*   **Retracement into Lunch:** Price retraces into lunch, running on buy-side liquidity.
*   **1:30 PM Trap Move:** A minor trap move occurs, exceeding the relative equal highs (buy-side liquidity).
*   **Displacement and Short-Term Lows:** Fair value gap trades up into it, wait for displacement.
*   **Convergence:** This occurs at 50% of the opening range and at the old swing low (down-closed candle order block and mean threshold).
*   The market starts to work lower again.

### Silver Bullet Framework (PM Session)

*   **Timeframe:** Between 2:00 PM and 3:00 PM, find an imbalance to enter and align with the directional bias.
*   **Sell-Side Inefficiency (City):** Trades up into it between 2:00 PM and 3:00 PM.
*   **Targets:** Hold for the opening range gap low and the daily fair value gap.
*   **Outcome:** A run lower, penetrating relative equal lows and one tick into the daily fair value gap, retracing back into the range.

### Daily Fair Value Gap (FVG) on Daily Chart

*   **Highlighted Areas:** The user highlighted this area on the daily chart.
*   **Favored Level:** Specifically stated the favor of the lower for the day.
*   **Delivery:** Price moved one tick below the low at 4381.75.
*   The printed level today was 4381.50.

## Conclusion

Hope you found this insightful. I'll try to be as direct and to the point as possible. Enjoy your weekend, and I'll touch base with you next week. Be safe.

Okay, here's the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining all original details, tone, and intent:

# **Market Analysis and Trading Strategy (June 26, 2023)**

**Video Link:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf_uYZBWTrA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf_uYZBWTrA)

**(Note:** There was a thunderstorm at the time of recording, which influenced the pace and approach.)

## **I. Overview and Prior Forecast (June 23, 2023)**

*   Refer to the market review from **Friday, June 23rd, 2023**, for the original forecasts. The strategies and predictions discussed here were established *before* the market activity observed in the chart.
*   **Focus:** This analysis primarily focuses on **ES** (E-mini S&P 500 futures).
*   **Additional Content:** A link is in the description of the video, where live trading of both **ES** and **NASDAQ** was demonstrated that morning.

## **II. Weekly Candlestick Chart Analysis**

*   The market filled the **fair value gap** (sell-side imbalance, buy-side inefficiency) with an overshoot (“wick”) on the buy-side.
*   It was previously mentioned on **Twitter** and in the **market review** that this area was likely to be a draw for **ES**.

## **III. Daily Chart and Twitter Confirmation (June 23, 2023)**

*   The analysis zooms into a **daily chart**, referencing a **tweet** shared at **9:00 AM New York local time** on **Friday, June 23rd, 2023**.
    *   **Integrity Pledge:** The speaker does not delete or edit tweets. Typos are corrected, but the original content remains. No "blue check" editing.

*   **Key Tweet:**
    *   "I prefer the lower," referencing two fair value gaps on **ES**. The same pattern was evident in the **NASDAQ**.
    *   Both fair value gaps were filled in today's market activity.

*   **Market Review Slide (June 23, 2023):** The slide presented in the **June 23, 2023, market review** highlighted the target drawdown area around **4369-4370** ("4370-ish"). The eyeball icon indicates a static chart forecast.

*   **Hourly Chart:** The hourly chart shows the actual market price delivery reaching that target perfectly.

## **IV. 15-Minute Timeframe Analysis**

*   **Fair Value Gap (Sell-Side Imbalance, Buy-Side Inefficiency - SIBI):**  A fair value gap existed with a small area remaining unfilled.
    *   The market traded up to a certain point but didn't *completely* reprice the entire gap. This left an exposed area of inefficiency with buy-side delivery.
    *   **Implication:** The market would likely be drawn back up to deliver on the buy-side (upward motion). Buy stops (buy-side liquidity) would be resting just above.

*   **New Week Opening Gap:** New week opening gap high and low are clearly shown in this view.
*   **Initial Market Movement:** The market initially ran up to take the buy-side, attempting to completely reprice to the SIBI high.
    *   **Sucker's Play:**  This upward movement was characterized as a "sucker's play," trapping retail traders who bought in.
    *   The market then repriced down to the **4370** target predicted on **Friday**.
*   **New Week Opening Gap Relevance:** Emphasizes the significance and consistent usage of the new week opening gap.

## **V. 5-Minute Chart: Detailed Price Action**

*   **New York Opening (Midnight):** The opening price of the candle at midnight New York local time is crucial and extends to 11 AM.

*   **Price Delivery:**
    *   The market rallies at **9:30 AM**, trading up to the buy-side liquidity pool within the 15-minute fair value gap (previously highlighted).

*   **Algorithm Behavior:** The algorithm reprices to a premium to an old inefficiency.
*   **Optimal Short Entries:** The best short entries occur *above* the opening price at midnight New York local time.

## **VI. Liquidity and Setup Identification**

*   **Buy-Side Liquidity:**
    *   The speaker emphasizes the importance of identifying *specific* liquidity points.
    *   The lecture from the previous week taught how to find setups that are perpetually reliable. The lecture teaches how to look for liquidity.

*   **Friday’s Prediction Reiterated:** Before the market opened on **Friday** at **9:00 AM New York local time**, it was stated that the market would trade around **4370**, confirmed by **Twitter**.

## **VII. "Judas Swing" Explained**

*   All the upward movement is described as a "Judas Swing": a false run designed to entice traders and get them positioned incorrectly before a significant move.

*   The market moves to a specific **PD Array element** for the entry (a sell program).

*   The target level is a specific price level, *not* determined by harmonic patterns, Elliott Wave theory, or Wyckoff methods.

*   **Weekend Gap:** The weekend prevents trading on Saturday and Sunday. Upon opening, the market creates a new week opening gap.
*   **New York Opening Rally:** The market rallies after opening at **9:30 AM**, trapping traders into thinking the price will continue upwards.

## **VIII. Smart Money Strategy**

*   **Smart Money** goes short.
*   **Counterparty:** London session liquidity.
*   **Target:** London session liquidity.
*   **Key Factors:**

    *   Market opens at **9:30** and rallies.

    *   Moves above the New York midnight opening price.

*   **Highest Probability Shorts:** Form at the price, not the time, of the New York opening.

*   **Judas Swing Timing:** Expected to occur between **9:30-10:00 AM** (the opening range).
*   **Retail Trader Trap:** Retail traders see the rally and assume the price will continue upward.

## **IX. Opening Range Gap Analysis**

*   **Additional Learning:** More concepts are introduced beyond what's already been covered.

*   **Chart Setup:**

    *   Using **TradingView**.

    *   Display a **one-minute chart**.

    *   Disable **"electronic trading hours"** and enable **"regular trading hours."**

*   **Friday's Closing Price:** On **Friday, June 23rd, 2023**, hover over the last candle (4:14 PM) to see the closing price (**4388.00** in this case).
*   **Monday's Opening Price:** Note the opening price on **Monday, June 26th, 2023**, at **9:30 AM**.
*   **Opening Range Gap Definition:** The difference between Friday's closing price and Monday's opening price.

*   **Gap Types:**
    *   **Opening Range Gap Lower (Discount):** Monday opens *lower* than Friday's close.
    *   **Opening Range Gap Higher (Premium):** Monday opens *higher* than Friday's close.
*   **Consequent Encroachment:** The midpoint of *any* gap is always a point of "consequent encroachment."
*   **Order Block Midpoints:**
    *   Gaps or Wicks: Midpoint is "consequent encroachment."
    *   Other Order Blocks (Breaker Block, Bullish/Bearish Order Block, Propulsion Block): Midpoint is "mean threshold" (50% of the range).

## **X. Applying the Opening Range Gap to the Chart (ES September 2023)**

*   The rally at **9:30 AM** is visible.
*   **Judas Swing:** All the upward movement is a "Judas Swing," running above buy-side liquidity in the London session.
    *   Trading above the New York midnight opening price.
    *   The need to view this multiple times for maximum understanding.
*   **Market Structure Shift:** A definitive drop takes out a low.
    *   A fair value gap emerges.
    *   Entering at that gap would have necessitated a wider stop-loss above the short-term high.

## **XI. Trade Execution Strategy**

*   The speaker preferred to wait for the price to run up again and break down.
*   Because there was a shift in Market Structure, the trader could have used that low.
*   The algorithm runs up again to the New York midnight opening price and back inside the fair value gap, which is a premium.
*   Another breakdown occurs, with two gaps forming.
*   The speaker watched the recording to determine the measurement for the Stop Loss.

*   **Stop Loss Placement (Consequent Encroachment):**
    *   The distance between the low and high of that higher fair value gap was measured, and the stop-loss was placed *just above* the 50% level (consequent encroachment).
    *   Justification: It had already been proven algorithmically that the price wouldn't go higher.

*   **Entering Inside the Gap:** Anticipating the algorithm to reprice back into the opening range gap.
*   **Discount Array:** Below 50%.

## **XII. Specific Trade Details**

*   **Execution:**

    *   Shorting contracts: 4387.75, 4387.00, 4395.50, 4394.50.

*   **Target:** 4370.

*   **Day Trade Scenario:** If it were a day trade, additional entries/pyramiding would have been possible.
    *   The fair value gap was a mental marker for potential additional entries.
    *   The target remained at **4370**.

## **XIII. Recap and Visual Confirmation**

*   **Opening Range Gap:** Demonstrated again in zoomed-in one-minute chart.
*   **Buy-Side Liquidity:** Friday's New York session liquidity is another contributing factor.

*   **Trading Options:** You could have:

    *   Sold Long Positions, or

    *   Short positions.

*   **Target:** Given the forecast on **Friday, June 23rd,** at **9:00 AM New York time**, the objective was to short to **4370**.

*   **Ideal Scenario:** A run towards what liquidity, where there are two forms of liquidity:

    *   London Session Buy-Side

    *   Friday's New York Session Buy-Side.

*   **Actionable Steps:** The speaker emphasizes going back into the chart and annotating it.


# **Trade Analysis and Strategy: Silver Bullet Mentality & Liquidity (June 26, 2023)**

## **I. Trade Overview: Silver Bullet & Opening Range Gap**

*   The speaker used the **Silver Bullet mentality** to execute a trade.
*   The strategy focused on price action *below* the **new week opening gap low.**
*   It wasn't necessary to reach the bottom of the gap to achieve significant results.

## **II. Dual Market Execution: ES & NASDAQ**

*   The speaker simultaneously traded **short positions** on both **NASDAQ** and **ES**.
*   A trader mirroring these trades in a funded or live account could have potentially earned **$16,000** without a complete market run.

## **III. Core Teaching: One Setup for Life & Liquidity**

*   The speaker emphasizes teaching **liquidity concepts** and their importance.
*   The speaker stated that even though the market didn’t reach the **4370** target, they were still able to make a profit.
*   The speaker is bearish, referencing previous sessions.

## **IV. New York Lunch Hour Liquidity Analysis**

*   The discussion highlights the importance of understanding liquidity points during the **New York lunch hour**.
*   Opposite of New York lunch buy-side liquidity.
*   **Liquidity Points:**
    *   Noon High
    *   High
    *   **Opening Range Gap** (shaded area)
*   The market reached approximately halfway into the shaded area.
*   This movement is considered reasonable.
*   Traders who predicted a downward movement to **4370** on Friday were better positioned to capitalize on this.
*   **Smart Money** anticipated the algorithm repricing back into half of the shaded area or above relative equal highs.
*   The algorithm rapidly moved to that level and lingered until the **3:15-3:45 PM Market on Close algorithm**.
*   The market then moved towards the target previously identified on Friday at **9:00 AM**, targeting the opposing **sell-side liquidity** during the lunch hour.
*   **Recap:** Watch the "one trade setup for life" lesson.

## **V. Recurring Strategy and Execution**

*   The speaker asserts that the logic taught in the "one trade setup for life" lesson is consistently applied in every trade and execution they demonstrate.
*   Many people ask about the following:

    *   Teach Me liquidity
    *   Teach me how to pick the right liquidity
    *   Teach me bias
    *   Teach me how to know where the Market's going to go next

*   Understanding this logic leads to:

    *   Endless setups.
    *   The ability to amaze others with results.
    *   Consistent success in funded accounts.
    *   Opportunities for profit in live accounts.
    *   The capacity to "destroy" any market, asset class, or timeframe.
*   The speaker encourages viewers to study the strategy thoroughly.

## **VI. Audience Engagement and Twitter Content**

*   The speaker encourages viewers to give the video a "thumbs up."
*   A link in the video description (above the disclaimer) leads to content not shown on YouTube.
*   Content on Twitter includes music-inspired executions of shorts in both **ES** and **NASDAQ**.
*   The content showcases stop placements and trade management from beginning to end.

## **VII. Artistic Expression on Twitter**

*   The speaker uses music on Twitter as a form of artistic expression.
*   They credit the music artist and do not monetize Twitter content.
*   Twitter content includes execution, trading, and inspired songs related to playback analysis.

## **VIII. Specific Details on Twitter Execution**

*   You can watch the speaker execute both the shorts in **ES** and **NASDAQ** on Twitter.
*   The videos show where stops are placed and how the trade is managed from start to finish.

# ICT Breaker Review and Tutorial

**Video URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HtRfFYiwO0

This is a brief review and tutorial/amplification of my ICT breaker concept.

## Dollar Index Analysis

*   **Timeframe:** Weekly Chart

*   **Observation:** Inefficiency noted between two candles (specific candle references implied).

*   Worked up inside of that inefficiency, resulting in an indecisive candle.

*   **Overall:** Lackluster trading session for the dollar last week.

### Range Analysis

*   Defined by low and high points.
*   Current state: Indecisive.
    *   Not clearly favoring either upward or downward movement.
*   **Strategy:** "We sit still. We try not to force our will or impose a bias that's not necessarily predetermined yet."

### Key Levels

*   **Resistance:** Rejection block (close of a specific candle).
    *   A trade above this level would signal a likely resumption of upward movement.
*   **Support:** Taking out the low would lead to targeting liquidity below.

### Daily Chart Observations

*   **Weekly Fair Value Gap:** Bodies of candles slightly outside the range.
*   **July 4th Effect:** Potential impact on volume due to the U.S. holiday.
    *   Expect cleaner price action in the latter part of the week (post-Wednesday).
*   **Downside Draw:** Daily fair value gap reached.

### Liquidity and Inefficiency

*   Liquidity taken below a specific low.
    *   Rationale: "Price only goes down for one of those two reasons [liquidity or inefficiency]."
*   Rally back into the short-term premium relative to high and low midpoint.
*   Weekly inefficiency transposed to the daily chart.
    *   Providing a backdrop for shorts.

## Euro Dollar Analysis

### Weekly Chart

*   **Observation:** Weekly inefficiency (opposite of the Dollar Index as expected).
*   **Consequent Encroachment:** Wick treated as a gap by the algorithm.
    *   Weekly high formed at the previous week's consequent encroachment of its premium.
*   **Indecisive Weekly Range:** Trading down into a discount (buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency).
    *   Framed by the high and low of a specific candle.
    *   Traded down into the inefficiency and then back into the weekly range.
*   **Important Note:** Weekly ranges apply to the daily chart.

### High of the Week Formation

*   Observed on Tuesday (bearish scenario has a 70% likelihood).
*   Formed at the previous week's consequent encroachment on the weekly candle.

### Hourly Chart Analysis (Euro)

*   Movement lower observed.
*   Run onto the previous week's consequent encroachment (wick on the weekly chart).
    *   Creating the high on Tuesday.
*   Breaks down, finding support at the old fair value gap (orange).
*   Rally and subsequent failure, breaking lower.

### Breaker Identification

*   Breaker present (described as "rather sloppy").
*   Extended run hitting the upper end of the inefficiency.
*   Blending of inefficiency and buy-side liquidity concepts.
    *   Buy-side liquidity resting above a short-term high.

### Premium Array

*   Trades up into it and aggressively sells off.
*   Attacking sell-side liquidity below a specific low.
*   Moves down into discount fair value gap.
*   Quick return back into the premium after reaching the discount.

### Higher Timeframe Information

*   Important for understanding lower timeframe movements.
*   Euro was handled beautifully with these elements.
    *   Short-term premium high
    *   Short-term discount low
    *   Inefficiency of both marketplace inefficiency below the marketplace
    *   Day of the week
*   Opposite end of the range forming on Friday.

### 15-Minute Timeframe Observations

*   Nice drop and rally observed.
*   Back-and-forth movement in the range is not a primary concern.

### Breaker Discussion

*   Rejection of the notion that a simple high-to-low-to-higher-high constitutes a breaker.
    *   Importance of the time of day when highs are forming.
    *   Algorithm prioritizes time.
*   Focus on the "Secret Sauce": Movement down after the high-low-higher high sequence.
*   Down-closed candle as the "sweet spot."

### Application of Concepts

*   Trading up into a premium relative to the range from high to low.
*   Reaching into the upper portion of the shaded orange inefficiency breaker.
*   Cut through candles because it's not supply and demand.
*   Hit perfectly at New York open.
*   Aggressively runs for the sell side.

### Sell-Side Liquidity Targeting

*   Focus on higher timeframe and discount fair value gap.
*   Algorithm pulls back up into the middle of the range (high and low of the week).
*   Consolidation inside of that premium for Vega.

## E-mini S&P Analysis

### Weekly Chart

*   Mentioned previously attempt to reach up into a weekly volume balance.
    *   Fell short but acted as a drawing of liquidity.
*   NASDAQ previously reached its volume balances.
*   Waiting for the "sixth sister effect" on S&P to draw it higher.
    *   Delivered "like gangbusters."
*   **Bias:** Starts on the weekly chart.

### Prediction vs. Reaction

*   "We need to predict the likely expansion in the weekly chart... We don't react to price."
*   Not aiming to predict the closing price, but the likely expansion higher or lower.

### Inefficiency Observation

*   Small inefficiency between the previous week's low and this week's high.
*   Traded down into it and rocketed up, taking out the short-term high.
*   Suspect that this still will be a factor this week.

### Daily Chart Inefficiencies

*   Two inefficiencies identified (specifics described as per the tweet).
*   Tweet sent out stating these were the two reference points.
    *   Initially favored the lower end.
    *   The top of the market not called.
*   In Primary Buy Models we look for Longs reaching for Discount.

### Long Opportunities

*   Looking for longs, reaching for discounts, and expanding into inefficiencies or buy-side liquidity.
*   Buy-side resting above and inefficiency above market price at the beginning of the week.
*   Throughout the week each day you were focusing on longs
*   Higher timeframe weekly chart suggesting price may go ultimately we stay with that bias each day every session we go in looking for a reason to be long when there's a buy program underway.

### Delivery

*   Beautiful delivery into a specific candle's high.
*   Perfect delivery and rally.
*   Premium area identified.

### Anticipation

*   Expecting to take out the high and gravitate towards the weekly volume imbalance.
*   Buy program sending price into discovery of buy-side and premium volume imbalance.

### Range Grading

*   Using 25%, 50%, and 75% levels as targets within the range.
*   Only reached the buy-side, falling short of the weekly volume imbalance.

### Market Maker Model Reference

*   Referencing knowledge of a market maker buy and sell model.
*   Area not seen as Wyckoff.

### Inversion Fair Value Gap

*   Referencing textbook explanation
*   Expecting to expand through that level.
*   Will become an inversion pair value gap.

### Trend Lines and Lower Timeframe Analysis

*   Market trading down into the lower fair value gap.
*   Expansion higher observed.
*   Range defined by the last up-close candle within low-high-lower low sequence.
    *   Trades into the inefficiency.

### Bullish Breaker

*   If aggressive you can use that high
*   Between this low and this low which is a bullish breaker.
*   Aggressive to conservative traders.

### Premium Fair Value Gap

*   Traders that simply look at gaps and price charts lose the idea of knowing where prices are ultimately trying to reach for which is the #1 rule.
*   Looking for periods where there is accumulation.

### Consolidation

*   Taking out sell-side; when a stop run occurs, the market should expand higher.
*   Breaks through the premium fair value gap.

### Inefficiency

*   The inefficiency trades down into the open rips higher
*   In the 15 min time frame.
*   We settle on the day.

### Key Takeaway

*   Looking for that area right in here to provide support.
*   The high of that fair value gap.
*   Want to see this be treated as a measuring gap or breakaway gap.

### Transposing Levels

*   Important to transpose levels from higher timeframes to lower timeframes.
*   Otherwise, the plot narrative will be lost.
*   Identify areas to add to long positions.

### Focus on the Draw on Liquidity

*   The video explains that focus should be the draw on liquidity to be successful.
*   It takes time understanding price action what is it reaching for and this is enough to warrant an expansion higher.

### S&P 15-Minute Candlestick

*   Illustration of a run into the inversion fair value gap.
*   Hitting it and rallying.
*   Inefficiency trades down into.

### Shared Link on Twitter

*   Was a showed you execution on Twitter.

### Accumulation

*   For obvious higher prices on NASDAQ and ES focusing primarily ES and been teaching conceptually the sixth sister Concepts.

*   ES showing been drawn higher in sympathy trying to catch up to what was delivered with the Run higher in NASDAQ.

*   Looking for periods where there is accumulation of logs.

*   We can see low and lower low in es on NASDAQ.

# Divergence, SMT, and Liquidity Runs

## NASDAQ and S&P Divergence Analysis

*   **Observation:** Divergence between **NASDAQ** and **S&P**.
    *   **NASDAQ** did not make a lower low, unlike **S&P**.
*   **SMT Divergence:** Expectation for price to move higher, assuming market leadership.
    *   If **NASDAQ** hadn't already established upside dominance, the divergence would favor trading **NASDAQ**.
*   **Sixth Sister Approach:**
    *   Using sympathy, **S&P** will attempt to trade higher.
    *   **S&P** may be more reliable because **NASDAQ** has already achieved its upside delivery.
    *   **Rationale:** **NASDAQ** has already demonstrated significant upside movement.

### Stop Run and Turtle Soup Entry

*   The taking out of the low is viewed as a stop run.
    *   Trusting a **Turtle Soup** entry involves buying sell stops.
*   Buying stronger leadership (**NASDAQ**) is valid.

### Comparison of Delivery

*   Delivery comparison between **S&P** and **NASDAQ**.
*   **S&P** exhibits a stronger willingness to move higher.
    *   Rally, pullback to the high end of the fair value gap (red level).
    *   Breaker extending forward within that range.
    *   Significant discount support for the entry area.
*   **NASDAQ**: Muddier, less certain footing.
    *   Lacks a higher low; presents a slopping consolidation.

### Detailed Price Action

*   **S&P**: Rips higher, revisits, shows strong upward intent.
*   **NASDAQ**: Higher low not evident; slopping consolidation.
*   **S&P**: Touches inversion fair value gap, aligns with bullish breaker low, rallies.
*   **S&P**: Consolidates for the rest of the day.
*   Confirmation of higher price delivery.
*   Low, lower low: Stop run below the lows (run on sell-side liquidity).
    *   Touches bullish breaker.

### SMT as Confirmation

*   **NASDAQ**'s unwillingness to create a lower low represents SMT.
*   Indicates accumulation and a cracking correlation.
*   Markets will consistently exhibit these inefficiencies when prices are making highs and lows.
*   **SMT's Role**:
    *   Confirmation tool, not a timing or selection tool.
    *   Qualifies the idea of being bullish.
*   Using **SMT** as a qualifier confirms a buy program.

### Turtle Soup Application with SMT

*   **SMT** helps to qualify bullish bias.
*   Aids **Turtle Soup** traders in buying sell stops or selling buy stops.
*   Without the understanding of where the market is going, it's very difficult to trade a false breakout pattern.
*   Months of analysis are necessary to learn this pattern.
*   **SMT's Primary Function**: Supports the idea that we are in a buy program.
    *   Okay to keep focusing on longs.

### Higher Lows and Liquidity

*   Another area showing a higher low (or low).
*   Reaching for relative equal lows (sell-side liquidity).
*   Run on sell-side liquidity.
*   **NASDAQ** could be used as a long entry.

### Weekly Targets and Volume Imbalance

*   **S&P** showing strength.
*   Market seeks finale, reaching for June 16, 2023 high.
*   Gravitating towards the weekly volume imbalance (blue shaded area).
*   Top end of inversion fair value on daily chart acts as resistance, leading to rallies.
*   Benefitting from knowing the weekly volume imbalance acts as a magnet for the algorithm.

### Points of Reference

*   Downside areas are reference for long entries or adding to existing positions.
*   Good for short-term or swing traders, confirming bias.
*   Lower timeframe order flow (Silver Bullet) can be used.
    *   10 AM-11 AM or 2 PM-3 PM time windows.

### Model Flexibility

*   Use information with a specific model.
*   Entry multipliers: Optimal trade entry, bull/bear block, buying sell-side liquidity, inversion fair value gaps, institutional order flow, etc.
*   Provides framework to assess the market's direction and confirm upward momentum.

### Divergence Example

*   Divergences (lower high, lower low) indicate upward intent.
*   SMT is a qualifier.
*   It gives you confirmation.
*   Order flow is probably not in the direction that you see the lower low being made when a higher low is being formed in a market that you're anticipating to be bullish anyway.
*   Looking for a specific area for weeks, calling it a draw for ES.
*   Bullish on ES for months.
*   Expecting continued upward movement.

## E-mini S&P 5-Minute Chart Analysis

*   Showing regular trading hours, highlighting the gap.
*   Settled on Thursday; opened at 9:30 AM on Friday.
*   **Tweet Reference:**
    *   Posted on June 30, 2023, at 9:52 AM (New York local time).
    *   High of 4493.75 is the daily June 16, 2023 high.
    *   Buy-side is "Juicy" (attractive target).

### Using Information

*   Use with fair value gaps, bull/bear blocks, buying sell-side liquidity.
*   Potential for opening range gaps to draw price down.
*   Market tendency for large range gaps during rapid movements.
    *   Target: Weekly volume imbalance (shaded blue).
*   **Bias:** Indicated earlier.

### Price Action Breakdown

*   Drop during lunch, taking out sell-side liquidity.
*   Rally, creating a fair value gap.
*   Market drops into gap perfectly, rallies away.
*   Attacks relative equal highs (initial buy-side liquidity).
*   Larger liquidity pool at June 16, 2023 daily high.
*   Gravitation towards the level and short by falling short of volume imbalance.

### Key Target

*   Looking for a draw to 4493.75 (buy-side).
*   This level represents the high on the daily chart.
*   Avoid short positions due to the large opening range gap.
*   No lower target given for Friday.
*   Weekly volume balance as the draw on liquidity, with a specific level.

### Stop Run and Inefficiency

*   Expecting higher prices.
*   Stop run on sell-side liquidity observed, followed by price increase.
*   Inefficiency, market returns to it.
*   **Lunch Time:** Buy-side is above.
*   4487.5 (buy-side).

### 11:50 to 12:10 Macro

*   Time for algorithm to initiate price run.
*   Runs for liquidity.
*   Drops down, then goes higher.
*   Run up targets the June 16, 2023 high.

### One-Minute Chart

*   Run to reach higher.

### One-Minute Chart Inefficiencies

*   Cycle through timeframes because you'll see the inefficiency that the market will reprice to, which isn't shown in the longer term.

### Run on Liquidity

*   We're blending not only is the lunch hour macro reaching up for the buy side but it's also this would be a run in the same direction of our higher time frame bias reaching for the June 16th High because in normal instances like say little bearish we would see the market rip up into here take out the buy side and then work lower because we're embarrassed cell program on the higher time frame charts we're not in a bearish Cell program we're in a higher time frame bullish buy program meaning that that shaded Blue Area up here that Weekly volume imbalance and the old high on June 16 2023 about that high is going to be buy side someone went short large funds have liquidity above there what kind buy side buy stops they're protecting they were holding shorts the algorithm runs against that it's not running against you okay it's not looking for your order it's going for where the large fund liquidity is or it's running for a higher time frame inefficiency which is also conveniently allowing that algorithm to reprice against the buy side liquidity resting above June 16 2023.

### Final Partial

*   "If you look at the diagram here this is my bearish breaker this is not a break and retest okay it's not an Fu candle it's not a like off it is a schematic in terms of understanding how runs on liquidity and then a repricing lower occurs so what we need to know is where is liquidity and there's two ways to use the breaker this is a bearish breaker and what we're understanding with this diagram is there's obviously when you have a market that is predisposed to go lower if you're anticipating the market going lower if you're looking for a bear Market to provide a additional entry or a point of reference for pyramiding new short positions this is what you're looking for okay this is one of the strongest PD arrays I have because the characteristic behind this PD array is that it is acting on pending orders so if you've ever traded and had your stop run hit and then see it run in your favor after your stop loss was hit that's what this pattern capitalizes on it really takes you into the marketplace in terms of a narrative to attack the ill-informed or retail Trader that tries to look for continuations some kind of trend following model if they have no idea where liquidity is and what narrative is and why that market should be going lower they get many times trapped by this move they will be caught being a buyer of a breakout above a short-term High and then it only goes up to a higher time frame Buy sell liquidity where the actual reversal occurs there's two stages of liquidity for the highest form of precision with my breaker you'll always have the short-term by side liquidity of all the short-term High but it's going to want to reach into a higher time frame by solid liquidity and then you're waiting to see if it runs away from that and then inside of this price Lake from A to B that right there is what you're looking for for targeting now I haven't taught this before this is the first time even my charter members and my private mentorship which nobody can join anymore and I don't even make videos for them anymore okay the only thing they get to do is ask me questions so this A to B leg we're ignoring all this this is market for traction okay this is the manipulation so with this out of the equation okay think of this as time distortion it's running from the low to the high to get that liquidity but once it does that ignore it"

# Advanced Breaker Pattern Analysis and Liquidity Dynamics

## Breaker Pattern Amplification: Beyond the 2022 Model

*   **Clarification:** This analysis is distinct from the 2022 model, which utilizes the price leg differently.
*   **Price Leg (A to B) Usage:**
    *   **Bearish Scenario:** If anticipating lower prices, the price leg from A to B is trusted when the market creates a run and starts to decline.
    *   Going short occurs when it runs above the buy-side liquidity; scaling in is a potential strategy.

### Scaling In Example (ES Trading)

*   **Example Position:** A 10-lot position might be built as follows:
    *   Initial: 6 contracts.
    *   Add 1: 3 contracts.
    *   Add 2: 1 contract.
*   **Application to Breaker Pattern:**
    *   Initial: 1 contract.
    *   Add 1: 3 contracts within the run.
    *   Add 2: 6 contracts on a strong run into the breaker.
*   **Rationale:** This approach mitigates drawdown if the market reverses quickly. The initial smaller position is augmented as confirmation increases, with larger positions added in high-probability areas.

### Addressing Misguidance and Correcting Misconceptions

*   **Purpose:** This lesson aims to provide more details and correct misconceptions about the breaker pattern prevalent in online content.
*   **Detailed PD Arrays:** More information will be available in forthcoming books.

## Bread and Butter Breaker Approach

*   **A to B Price Leg:** Take the leg from high to low.
*   **Fibonacci Application:** Apply Fibonacci retracement to this leg and use standard deviations lower.
*   **Standard Deviation Target:** One standard deviation lower from the range is the "easiest bread and butter approach."

### Trading Within Fair Market Value

*   Entry can occur before the price trades back up to a specific level, if you're on-side and know you're looking for it, and you're in a fair market.
*   The level is not needed to come down into to trade back up.
*   Entering in the price leg running lower, *before* it even breaks out that low is possible.
    *   Because not a breakout trader, and not a break and retest trader.

### Addressing Fear of Loss

*   **Scenario:** What if going short results in the price moving higher, triggering a stop loss?
*   **Response:** Accept the loss.
    *   If the analysis still indicates lower prices, re-enter the trade with half the initial position size.
*   **Key Principle:** Losing trades are inevitable; focus on managing risk and adapting to market conditions.

## Experience and Market Dynamics

*   **30 Years of Experience:** Informing advance insights and executions shared on Twitter.
*   **Experience Factors:** Leaning on 30 years of experience that you don't have.
*   **Key Considerations:**
    *   Market narrative.
    *   Drawing on liquidity.
    *   Day of the week, time frame, and session.

### The Pitfalls of the "Kitchen Sink" Approach

*   **Avoid Overcomplication:** Trying to use everything all the time leads to frustration.
*   **Focus on Best Scenarios:** Experience helps identify optimal setups.

### Time and the Ruthless Nature of Financial Markets

*   **Time Requirement:** Learning to use these tools effectively takes time—longer than anticipated.
*   **Market Reality:** The financial markets are ruthless.
*   **Language of Opportunity:** The teachings provide a language to identify and exploit market inefficiencies and imbalances.

## Reversal and Continuation

*   **Reversibility:** Everything taught can be reversed.
*   **Bullish Context:** In a bullish scenario (buy program), the pattern can be a continuation pattern.
*   **Intraday Application:** These patterns form on any timeframe.

### Liquidity Pools and Qualifier

*   Understanding the narrative is important to know where liquidity is.
*   **Two Levels of Sell-Side Liquidity:**
    *   Short-term liquidity created with the short-term high in the rally up.
    *   Significant higher timeframe sell-side liquidity.
*   A good qualifier is to anticipate liquidity lower and like when it goes real close to it and rallies because that's enticing longs that makes this a much more juicier liquidity pool.
*   **Aggressive Entry:** If extremely bullish, buying sell stops is possible.
*   **Conservative Approach:**
    *   Use the price run and Model 2022 to enter in any fair value gap.
    *   Anticipate the run, or use the rules that take out the high, with any retracement back into the price run (2022 model).

## Standard Deviations and Targeting

*   **Price Leg (A to B):** Key for standard deviation calculations.
*   **Easy Setup:**
    *   Long position based on low-to-high measurement.
    *   Entry within fair value gap, institutional order flow entry drill, or inversion fair value gap in the leg.
    *   Target: Two legs of the run added to the high (one standard deviation of the A to B price range).
*   **Simplicity:** This "bread and butter" setup can be the basis of a trading career.

### Supercharging with Higher Timeframe Context

*   **ICT Advantage:** Learn to use the information to amplify the potential.
*   **Higher Timeframe Alignment:** Synchronize with a higher timeframe buy model.
*   **Standard Deviation Confluence:** Confirm alignment between standard deviations and larger timeframe liquidity pools.

## Example: July 2, 2023 Analysis

*   **Date and Time:** July 2, 2023, 6:05 AM (New York time).
*   **Chart:** Five-minute chart.
*   **Formation:** Low, high, lower low, forming a breaker.
*   **A to B Leg Focus:** Using low to high for standard deviation calculations.

### Trading the Run Before the Break

*   **Advanced Entry:** Trading in this run *before* it happens, by anticipating a run to a pool of liquidity or inefficiency above the marketplace
*   **Not a Break-and-Retest Trader**
*   **Time Distortion:** The drop down is both manipulation and time distortion.

### Stop Run and Re-Entry

*   **Stop Run:** The market may knock out long positions with sell stops below a certain level.
*   **Re-Entry Strategy:** After a stop run, wait for an imbalance, then buy, trusting the stop run has occurred.

### Standard Deviation Application

*   **Fibonacci Tool:** Apply the Fibonacci tool to the A to B leg.
*   **Example:** Standard deviation of -1 results in a target of 4496.5.
*   **Easy Setup:** Entry without needing the high to be broken.

### Refining Entry Points

*   **Up-Close Candles:** Up-close candles disrupting the price run within the price leg are key.
*   **Range Usage:** Utilize the range of those candles as a buy zone.

### Comfort and Pullbacks

*   **Friday and Proximity:** Because it's Friday of last week, and really close to that June 16 high, don't want to see any deep retracements.
*   **Rationale:** Proximity to the June 16 high mitigates the need for deep retracements.

### Blending Multiple Factors

*   **Key Factors:**
    *   Being on side (confirmation of direction).
    *   Anticipating a run to a pool of liquidity or inefficiency above the marketplace.
    *   Day of the week (Friday).
*   **Magnet Effect:** Strong factors act as a "magnet," drawing price up.
*   **Algorithm Dominance:** The algorithm keeps repricing higher regardless of short selling volume.

### Dynamic Support and Resistance

*   **Language for Algorithm:** This approach provides a language to understand how the algorithm reacts to specific price levels.
*   **Precise Levels:** Qualifies very specific levels of dynamic support and resistance.

## Relative Equal Highs and New Breakers

*   **Relative Equal Highs:** Identify relative equal highs.
*   **Buy-Side Liquidity:** Anticipate buy-side liquidity above these highs.
*   **Qualifier for New Breaker:** If the market goes above these highs, it can be a qualifier for a new breaker.
*   **TGIF Trade:** If you want to trade inside the range, a lot of you were anticipating on Twitter reaching out to me saying TGIF is what happened, but you have to see it get to the liquidity and fulfill its weekly range before it wants to pull back in.

### High Precision

*   High of that candle right there is exactly at 44.96 and a half.

### Trading Inside the Range

*   **Breaker Identification:** Identify the breaker within the range.
*   **Range Dynamics:**
    *   The trader that anticipates this is reasonable.
    *   Engages with some measure of coloring outside the lines.

### Ways of Determining

*   There are ways of determining... (the sentence is incomplete in the source text).


Okay, here's the organized and refined version of the provided text. Every detail, context, and nuance from the original has been retained.

# Advanced Breaker Pattern Analysis: Confirmations, Precision, and Market Dynamics

## Confirming Standard Deviation and Market Movement

*   **Student Learning:** My students are learning where market movements are likely to occur, and you're learning it now, too.
*   **Confirmation from Bodies:** The bodies of the candles are indicating the market isn't done and will reach higher.
    *   This is because the standard deviation of **4496.5** was confirmed again by the candle bodies.
*   **Continuing the Analysis:**
    *   We will still use the high to low as **A to B**.
    *   **Question:** Why not a different high?
    *   **Answer:** The low at **4491.25** is the same low being referenced.
*   **Ignoring Unfinished Highs:**
    *   Ignoring the current high because it's unfinished and will run higher.
    *   The target is either the weekly volume imbalance or a specific high (the exact level is not yet needed).
    *   The **A to B** leg is already established.
    *   The leg didn't yet go lower.

### Retracement and TGIF (Thank God It's Friday)

*   **Retracement Depth:** How low can it retrace with **TGIF**?
    *   Two standard deviations inside the inefficiency and within the breaker.

## Precision and Proprietary Techniques

*   **Dominion Mentors:** Dominion mentors attempting to teach my techniques lack the authority.
*   **Breaker Pullback Range:** Understanding the range where the breaker can pull back into.
*   **Candle Confirmation:** When a candle reaches exactly **4480.75**, the standard deviation target is precisely hit.
    *   This level of precision is not attributable to Wyckoff, supply and demand, or any other commonly known methodologies.
    *   This technique is proprietary and originated with me.
    *   I codified it, engineered it, and assembled it.
    *   This is what you are seeing.
    *   I am currently writing all the books that will ever be made about this methodology.
    *   Others will parrot what you're hearing, but this level of precision is unique.
*   **Date Stamp:** July 2nd, 2023.
    *   Breakers will change after today.
    *   Don't create videos until you grasp the concept.
    *   Observing and sharing this phenomenon is encouraged, as it builds confidence and benefits both you and the community.
*   **Blending Elements:** Many factors come together in this analysis.

## Refining Entry on a One-Minute Chart

*   **Timeframe Shift:** Moving to a one-minute chart.
*   **Breaker Utilization:** How the upper portion of the breaker is used.
*   **Change in Delivery State:** Zeroing in on the change in the state of delivery in the last candle.
*   **Buying Opportunity:** Buying is possible anywhere within this candle's range.
*   **Order Block Usage:** Can use that order block.
*   **Down Closed Candle:** The last down-closed candle within the breaker on the lowest timeframe.
    *   Stripping it down to the range.
    *   The entire run was shown on the five-minute chart, but entry is refined here.

### ICT Breaker and Order Block Theory

*   **ICT Breaker Range:** Measuring the high and low of this range.
    *   There are gradients to that: upper quarter, 50% or mean threshold, low and lower quarter.
*   **Order Block Theory:** Breakers are a form of order blocks.
*   **Midpoint or Mean Threshold:** **44.84.50.**
*   **Algorithm Utilization:** If the algorithm allows price to be utilized to go long.
*   **Smart Money Perspective:** What price level is needed to reach **44.84.50**?
    *   Price needs to print at least **4484.25**.
*   **Spread Consideration:** This allows the spread not to be a hindrance for smart money to go long.
*   **Market Signature:** If you don't take that as a trade, does the market show a willingness to move away from that level?
    *   Yes.
    *   That’s a signature I'm watching.
    *   Seeing price do that.
    *   These types of things support the idea of continuously grinding towards buy-side liquidity and reaching the weekly volume imbalance.
*   **Holistic Understanding:** All these elements lead to a better understanding of where price is going.

### Order Flow and Inefficiencies

*   **Order Flow Context:** Once inside order flow, there are inefficiencies.
*   **Bullish Bias:** Seeing the long and an inefficiency, but remaining bullish.
    *   Not looking for shorts into the inefficiency.
*   **Correct Identification of Order Flow:** Understanding how the algorithm will reprice and where it’s repricing to.
*   **Unrivaled Precision:** Providing a level of precision that is unrivaled.

## Long Positions, Levels, and Anchors

*   **Low, High, Lower Low:**
*   **Long Positions:** Long in here. Buying. Buying all that stuff right here. Buying it there, buying it there, and buying it there.
*   **Level Utilization:** Look at those levels. What am I utilizing?
    *   Consequent encroachment of that five-minute fair value gap.
        *   Defined by this level and that level.
    *   Buying consequent encroachment of the inversion fair value gap.
        *   Which is this level here.
    *   Expecting this to be support and find a point of accumulation to send it higher to attack buy-side liquidity and drop into the high on the 16th of June 2023.
*   **Reference Points:** Using these reference points like rungs on a ladder.
*   **Mountain Climbing Analogy:**
    *   Like a mountain climber looking for the next anchor point.
    *   Or a free climber planning their next grab point.
    *   Looking for all these areas as price presents them.

### Fair Value Gap Accumulation

*   **Fair Value Gap:** When price was down here, that fair value gap was already there.
    *   Accumulating long positions in the middle of it, which is the consequent encroachment of the five-minute fair value gap.
    *   This gap was already there on a limited chart.
*   **Body Respect:** Look at the body respecting it.
    *   Staying inside that gap.
    *   Buying it when it's in the midpoint of it.
    *   Accumulating and pyramiding with logic.
*   **Engineered, Not Luck:** This is engineered, not cherry-picked.

## Breaker Utilization and Macro Timing

*   **Breaker Confirmation:** Seeing this low, high, lower low, what else is occurring there?
    *   That’s a breaker.
    *   Utilizing all that framework.
    *   Going inside this price leg with the support of this idea as a breaker because this is an A to B and this is all distortion and manipulation.
    *   Using that as the entry point.
    *   Going back into this little short-term price leg right here.
*   **Lay Here is the A to B:**
*   **Buy Side Liquidity** that the High on the 16th, the Daily Candle will draw up to that with the weekly volume and balance.

### 11:50 to 12:10 Macro

*   **Time Window:** All this is occurring in the 11:50 to 12:10 macro.
*   **Algorithm Spooling:** A specific sweet period of time where the algorithm will start spooling, reaching for liquidity.
*   **Macro Misinformation:** Don't listen to people who spread misinformation about macros.
    *   If you are talking about macros, you have no idea what you're doing, stop spreading this information.
*   **Mentorship Transparency:**
    *   You are right here with mentorship.
    *   Not doing paid mentorships or upselling.
    *   Want you to learn correctly and avoid people rebranding my stuff incorrectly.

## Standard Deviations and Confluence

*   **Standard Deviation Levels:** Three standard deviations, four standard deviations, five standard deviations, six, seven, and a half.
    *   Six and a half is right at that old high.
        *   **4493.75.**
        *   Tells me that that will definitely reach for that liquidity.
        *   Remember **44.93.75** is the high of June 16, 2023.
*   **Confluence of Levels:** Showing how to take the levels here for standard deviation and when they agree with a range of liquidity.
    *  If we look at how the negative 6.5 standard deviation comes in at the daily high of June 16th
*   **Learning a Language:** This is like learning a new language, it takes time.
*   **Liquidity Target:** Expectation the market will reach up into the liquidity Above This high at **44 93.75**.
*   **Weekly Volume Imbalance:** The range up here, which is the weekly volume imbalance.

### Targeting and Dynamic Levels

*   **Breakers for Targeting:** If we take that range and use all the breakers for any standard deviation idea or approach to look for targeting.
*   **Confluence of Levels:** You want to see a Confluence of levels anywhere in that range.
*   **Target Range:** **44.96.50**, which is based on that **A to B** price leg here to here.
    *   Have that level and **44.95.75.**
    *   Qualifying and confirming that the high on the 16th of June 2023 that is in fact going to be reached for.
*   **Exit Points:** Any one of those two price levels is a good price point to exit.
    *   **44 95.25.**
    *   You have to factor in the spread.
*   **Spread Consideration:** Giving myself anywhere between one and a half handles to a half of handle, or one quarter of a point, to let the spread do that.
*   **Dynamic Levels:** These levels are dynamic and will pull price to them.

## Algorithm Pricing and Market Context

*   **Algorithm Calculations:** All of the calculations that go behind how these algorithms price commodities, index futures, 4X use the information I'm showing here.
*   **Not Traditional Methods:** This is not a harmonic pattern, Wyckoff, supply and demand, or Elliott Wave.
*   **Time Awareness:** Understanding time first, what time of day this is occurring.
*   **Lunch Hour in New York:** The beginning of the lunch hour in New York.
*   **Algorithm Repricing:** The algorithm will reprice against existing liquidity.
*   **Morning Session Context:** The morning session saw lower prices.
*   **Stop Runs:** It’s going to roll back on what the stops resting above these relative equal highs.
*   **Friday Considerations:** Why did I take the majority of the trade off there if you think it's going to go up to your ICT?
    *   Because it's Friday, and I might be wrong.
    *   This is a higher timeframe Target that Weekly volume imbalance, so it doesn't have to deliver that one Friday.
*   **June 16th High:** Felt very strongly that the June 16th high would be delivered.
*   **Risk Management:** In the event that I'm not correct about that, I got the lines portion of the move off at a logical place because I'm teaching you to do that very thing.
*   **Partial Takeoffs:** Could have simply took a small portion off here in the larger portion off right here, and then 15 contracts could have came off there, and then my final right there, and then eventually my single contract got stopped out there.
*   **Transparency:** Tweeted where I had my stock and where my target was which was the weekly volume balance just below it.
*   **Real Execution:** All that is in the trade execution all the details you hear.
    *   This is not Market replay it's not Market replay reports where it's fake.
    *   Not using ninjatrader where we can pretend to show profitability.
    *   This is actual real Market executions these are real time applications.

## Simplicity and Continued Learning

*   **Long Term Application:** All this stuff is helpful over time when you're utilizing everything that I've taught you.
*   **Refrain from Instant Gratification:** Eventually get to the point where you refrain from trying to get the simple rate of right away, figure it out and get out there and start making money because it doesn't work that way.
*   **Unbelievable Precision:** If you want unbelievable levels of precision, I'm teaching it to you, but it's going to take you some time to get there.
*   **Bread and Butter Setup:** You don't need to have this level of position all you need is a simple bread and butter set up.
*   **Breaker Application:** Taught you that tonight using a breaker.
*   **No Break and Retest:** You don't need to have the break and retest.
*   **Buying and Selling Inside Breakers:** Taught you how to buy and sell inside of the breaker before it even goes above its trigger point that I've already introduced initially when I taught Breakers.
*   **Future Content:** I'll have much more to teach you with each one of these PD arrays, but for now, this should suffice until talk to you next time, be safe.

# Market Analysis and Trading Strategy Breakdown

## Introduction

The speaker is providing a real-time analysis of market movements, specifically focusing on potential trading opportunities. The speaker will also teach about macro on Sunday at 2PM. The video URL for this analysis is: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FGFEuaDSOc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FGFEuaDSOc)

## Initial Market Observation

*   The speaker observes that the "**foreign price is reaching down**" potentially offering a price point within the "**eyeshow balance**" area.
*   Speaker acknowledges the presence of "efficiency" at this price point.

## Trade Execution and Rationale

### First Trade

*   Initially, the speaker attempts to execute a "losing trade" as requested on Twitter, with the intent of using the experience to teach how to resolve drawdowns.
*   The speaker placed a stop watch close but the idea of a "losing trade" was not executed.
*   After the market moved in his favor, the speaker closed the trade and shorted the position instead, adding to it in anticipation of a downward move.

### Trade Management

*   The speaker plans to take profits (i.e., "take three off") at specific levels.
*   First take profit will be "right under here", and then "just underneath there".
*   The final profit target is set at a specific level to "close out this week".
*   Additional shorts were added to the position when price bumped the bottom end of the Bison efficiency.

## Technical Analysis and Market Structure

### Key Levels and Concepts

*   Mention of a "Memphis low" and a "small little gap".
*   The speaker says, "Liquidity does not exist is like a real phenomenon, is another partial".
*   Identification of an "inefficiency" zone as a potential target.
*   Reference to an "Order Block" that may factor into the price movement.
*   The speaker believes right before the run up, stop loss orders were sitting right below.
*   Stop loss sell stops are sitting right below because it would be advantageous to deliver there from up here.

### Market Phases (ICT Methodology)

*   The speaker outlines the stages:
    *   Original Consolidation
    *   Accumulation
    *   Accumulation Smart Money Reversal
    *   Low-Risk Sell
    *   Redistribution (Second Stage Distribution)
    *   Acceleration Attack
    *   Regional Consolidation with South Side Residing at Low Rate
*   Several factors exist between this low and that efficiency rate.

### Additional Details

*   The speaker is looking at taking 3 contracts off the position at various profit targets.
*   The speaker mentions adding one contract to prove his theory.

## Risk Management

*   Stop loss is rolled up. The stop loss is located just above the mean threshold of the last up close candle.
*   If a retracement occurs into the inefficiency, the speaker views it as completely permissible.
*   Speaker is okay with the stop being triggered if the price rolls back.

## Environmental Considerations

*   The speaker apologizes for background noise from a running dryer, explaining the laundry room's proximity to the kitchen area.

## Trade Adjustments and Justification

*   Stop is located right above really smooth highs.
*   The speaker increases the contract size in anticipation of a continued downward move, relying on technical analysis to support the decision.

## Reminder from Speaker

*   As a reminder when teaching the concept of five handles/points (20 ticks) in the E-mini S&P, the equivalent for Nasdaq is 20 handles or 80 ticks.

## Potential Market Manipulation

*   The speaker suspects potential market manipulation suggesting doji's are promoting the idea that the market is going to turn around.
*   The speaker's markings are over top of the run and go right into this area.

## Time-Based Analysis

*   The speaker notes the approach of the last hour of the New York PM session (starting at 3:00 PM).

## Current Market State

*   The drop from here to here is nicely delivered efficiently.
*   Inefficiency here was repriced too.
*   Speaker acknowledges all the back and forth price action, then down.
*   The speaker has been in and out of an inefficiency multiple times.
*   The speaker has hit the bottom of a bison efficiency.
*   He states "So, it's all green light for it to go lower and pair up that sell side liquidity, deliver inefficiency over here to efficient right in here."
*   The speaker is not saying it's the lowest of the day.

## Target Focus

*   The speaker is focused on the fractal, looking for the completion of the run.
*   Analysis is being completed on Friday April 9th.

## Transparency

*   The speaker notes he is hammering the market pretty bad today and trying to see confusions.
*   The speaker will change the chart to show it is not Market Replay.
*   The speaker mentions being nervous moving the trail and states that he doesn't like it when people do it.

## Internal Dialogue

*   The speaker discusses his internal dialogue, wondering how long traders would feel if they saw their stop loss below that low.
*   The speaker does not want to see the market come back up to the bottom on the old bison balance or certain inefficiency right here.

## Perspective on Trading

*   The speaker states, "It's really nice being in a position where being right is not the end result of choice."
*   They are in a position where they can take something off multiple times.

## Candle Consideration

*   Speaker mentions that the market should deliver on this candle or the very next candle.
*   Speaker is referencing the small separation between the candle's low.
*   The speaker wants to see price move away from the two up close candles together.

## Emotional Control

*   "No emotion, no reason for concern, no excitement when you're right. It's a continuous balancing act that a Trader must maintain."

## Speed-Up Explanation

*   The speaker indicates he speeds things up because watching the market is like watching paint dry.

## Order Block Analysis

*   The speaker is wondering if the market will accelerate down to the order block.
*   The order block is two consecutive down close candles.
*   The high to the opening would be a very sensitive price point.
*   There is a fair value gap in the same area.

## Final Target and Strategy

*   The speaker is going to take his stop and roll it down to the rejection block right there on this closed candle.

## Market Maker Cell Model

*   "It's traded to the market maker cell model South Side liquidity which is the reason why I had that limit order there, and the two remaining contracts I have are being framed on the basis of that small Little Fairy you got there."
*   The Market has been explained in the source code.

## Results

*   The speaker states that is a $26,240 day all over this thing.
*   All fills from the day are included.

## Disclaimer

*   The speaker toggles the screen to show it is not market replay.

## Closing

*   The speaker made $26,240 on the NQ.
*   The speaker will teach macro this weekend on Sunday at 2PM.
*   "Enjoy your weekend, until I talk to you next time, be safe."

Here's the market review for July 9th, 2023, organized for clarity and detail:

## Market Review: July 9th, 2023

### Dollar Index Analysis

#### Weekly Chart

*   **Video URL:** <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKg_r0DIa3k>
*   Observed on the weekly chart:
    *   **Mean Threshold:** Up-close candle (bearish order block). Price worked up into this level several weeks prior.
    *   **Fair Value Gap:** Previously identified.
    *   **Liquidity Pool:** Located on the sell side.
*   Current Situation: In a trading range. Multiple attempts to breach the imbalance, all unsuccessful.
*   **Short-Term Sell Side Liquidity Pool:** Present. A significant amount resting below.
*   Upcoming Week Prediction:
    *   Favor a run below the current low.
    *   Monitor price action if this low is breached.
    *   **Scenario 1 (Acceleration):** Expect a move towards lower sell-side liquidity.
    *   **Scenario 2 (Rejection):** Potential for the price to remain within the current range.

#### Daily Chart

*   **Weekly Mean Threshold:** Price action has interacted with the weekly mean threshold of the bearish order block.
*   **Weekly Fair Value Gap vs. Daily Chart:** The weekly fair value gap isn't as distinct on the daily chart.
*   **Higher Timeframe PD Arrays:** Higher timeframe PD arrays should be transposed to lower timeframes.
*   **Daily Fair Value Gap:** Price worked into this level, resulting in a sell-off last Friday.
*   **Down-Close Candle:** Monitoring Sunday's opening and Monday's trading relative to this candle.
*   **Potential Order Block:** Anticipating a possible return to this area.
*   **Breaker:** High-Low-Higher High pattern present. May encourage price to revisit this area.
*   **Bearish Breaker:** The entire down-closed candle is a bearish breaker. Need to be mindful of this.
*   Overall Bias: Favor a run below the current low, watching for acceleration. If there's acceleration expect all that liquidity to be taken out.

#### Hourly Chart

*   **Weekly Fair Value Gap:** Shown on the hourly chart.
*   **Holiday Consideration:** Fourth of July highlighted. The Market reflects lower volume on days with national holidays in the US.
*   **Monday Opening Price:** New York midnight opening price.
*   **Weekly Power 3:** Focus on the opening price. If looking for shorts, rally higher on Thursday.
*   **Trading Mondays:** Recommendation to try to find setups before Wednesday before Non-farm payroll Friday.
*   **Thursday Emphasis:** Due to the July 4th holiday, cleaner price action expected towards the latter portion of the week (Thursday and Friday).
*   **Judas Swing:** Price action rallies, takes out buy-side liquidity, and then drops back down.
*   **Weekly Fair Value Gap Interaction:** The high bodies stay close to the high of the Weekly fair value Gap. As soon as this candle closes and opens again, we trust that the high was a run on liquidity.
*   **Consequent Encroachment:** Monitor if any rallies are held at bay at the consequent encroachment of the high to the close of that candle, around 103.421.
*   **Lower End of Weekly Fair Value Gap:** Functions as resistance, followed by a sharp break below.
*   **Immediate Rebalance:** Return to the open for an immediate rebalance (a setup taught previously).
*   **Judas Swing Implications:**
    *   Indicates manipulation and stop run.
    *   Requires a pre-existing bias (looking for lower prices).
    *   Target: Old low and weekly fair value gap.
*   **Displacement:** Displacement below the low occurs on a candle.
*   **Fair Value Gap Absence:** The very next candle opens up rallies back up to the candle's low, so there is no Fair value Gap.
*   **Urgent Price Delivery:** Market moves quickly to reach specific liquidity or inefficiency levels (liquidity over here). Aggressive drop during Non-Farm Payroll Friday.
*   **Weekly Power Three Summary:** Open rallies, making the high of the week, and then trades lower in the latter portion of the week.

#### 15-Minute Timeframe

*   **Monday New York Midnight Opening Price:** Extended throughout the week.
*   **Fair Value Gap:** Price trades up into it during the New York open.
*   **8:30 AM Payroll Friday Report:** Causes a breakdown.
*   **Bearish Order Block:** Last up-close candles consecutively.
*   **Opening Price Reference:** The algorithm references this price point, going back up into it and dropping aggressively for the sell-side.
*   **Euro/Dollar Inverse Correlation:** Everything expected in the dollar index should be reversed in the euro.

### Euro/Dollar Analysis

#### Weekly Chart

*   **Weekly Volume Imbalance:** Attention called to this for months.
*   **Retracement to Bullish Order Block:** Price retraced to this, rallying and creating a fair value gap. Multiple times it traded down into it.
*   **Inversion Fair Value Gap:** Desired behavior for this area – trade above it, find it as support, and then move towards the buy-side and weekly volume imbalance.
*   **Longer-Term Draw on Liquidity:** Expect a trade up into the 111.00 - 113.50 range, assessing how far it progresses into the weekly volume imbalance.

#### Daily Chart

*   **Relative Equal Highs:** Represent buy-side liquidity.
*   **Weekly Volume Imbalances:** Located above.
*   **Weekly Fair Value Gap:** Being treated as an inversion fair value gap (acting as support). Doesn't necessarily need to be touched again.
*   **Tape Reading/Demo Trading:** Suggests practice if the price revisits the area.
*   **Bullish Order Block:** Last down-closed candle.
*   **Weekly Fair Value Gap (Discount):** Looking for a run-up into premium arrays (buy-side and weekly volume imbalance).
*   **Dollar Index Correlation:**
    *   Consider dollar index short-term low and how it trades below it.
    *   Similarly, consider the euro/dollar high and how it trades above it. Expecting aggressive movement towards relative equal highs.
*   **Caution Against Bearish Bias:** If going above the highs, it is going to treat definitely inside of that Weekly volume of balance.

#### Hourly Chart

*   **Buy-Side Liquidity:** Located above.
*   **Weekly Inversion Fair Value Gap:** Present.
*   **Buy-Side Imbalance Sell-Side Inefficiency:** Extending forward.
*   **Daily Bullish Order Block:** Interacted with.
*   **15-Minute Bullish Order Block:** Identified.
*   **Two-Hour Order Block:** A larger order block encapsulating the high-to-low range, represented on the hourly chart.
*   **Order Block Theory:** Toggling through multiple timeframes, including non-standard ones.
*   **Intraday Charts (Silver Bullets/Model 2022):** Reference to teaching on YouTube.
    *   Utilizing 5-minute, 4-minute, 3-minute, 2-minute, and 1-minute charts.
    *   Even using less than 1-minute charts (30-second, 15-second, 5-second).
*   **Top-Down Approach:** The order block theory relies on understanding the price delivery continuum. Not just one candle.
*   **Breaker Pattern:** Swing low, swing high, swing low (lower than the first).
*   **PD Array Multiplier:** Using order block, breaker, and buy-side inefficiency.
*   **Trade Example:** Rally, trade down to the breaker, then rally through the weekly inversion fair value gap.
*   **Ideal Scenario:** Would have liked to see a trade back down to touch the inversion fair value gap again.
*   **Risk Management:** Don't want to see the high of the candle (low of buy-side inefficiency) traded through.
*   **Bullish Bias:** As long as the price remains above the high (low of the buy-side inefficiency), a bullish outlook for euro/dollar is maintained.

#### 15-Minute Timeframe (Euro)

*   **New York Open/Non-Farm Payroll Friday:** Price drops down into the daily bullish order block.
*   **Consequent Encroachment:** With Buy-side imbalance Sell-side inefficiency.
*   **Multiple PD Arrays:** Confluence of a Daily Order Block with the shaded area and the last down closed candle within the New York Open Killzone.
*   **Killzone:** 7 AM - 9 AM New York local time.
*   **News Embargo:** 8:30 AM release of non-farm payroll numbers.
*   **Rally and Retest:** Rally up, come back down, hit the breaker, rally, down close candle, trade back into it once more that right there would have been a buy.
*   **Shaded Area Midpoint:** As long as the price is above the midpoint, looking for higher prices, aiming for buy-side and/or the weekly volume imbalance.

### E-mini S&P (ES) Analysis

#### Weekly Chart

*   **Weekly Volume Imbalance:** Present.
*   **Price Action:** Traded down about halfway of the down-close candle.
*   **Upcoming Week:** Monitoring how price trades this week.
*   **Not Picking the Top:** Emphasis on not trying to predict the market top.
*   **Retracement Potential:** Expecting a retracement back into the range and then expanding up into the weekly volume imbalance within the next two weeks.
*   **Contingency:** Acknowledging that Sunday's opening could change the outlook.

#### Daily Chart

*   **Weekly Volume Imbalance:** Fell slightly short of reaching it.
*   **Fair Value Gap:** Interacted with.
*   **Volume Imbalance:** Present.
*   **Closing Basis Threshold:** Uncomfortable with price closing below 4400.
*   **Range-Bound Potential:** Potential for price to move within the range as long as the order block remains intact.
*   **Loss of Order Block:** If the down-closed candle (order block) is lost, attention shifts to the buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency around 4300.
*   **Avoid Picking Top:** Reinforces the strategy of avoiding attempts to predict the market top.
*   **Immediate Rebalance:** Opened, rallied, and performed an immediate rebalance.
*   **Potential for Aggressive Decline:** The market appears heavy and poised for a possible aggressive move lower.


Here's the refined and well-structured market review, meticulously preserving every detail and nuance while enhancing clarity and readability:

## E-mini S&P (ES) Analysis Continued

### Weekly Chart (Continued)

*   The market could easily rally and create a higher high into that **Weekly Volume Imbalance**.
    *   Possibilities:
        *   Give up the ghost entirely and go lower.
        *   Accelerate to the upside.
*   Current Approach:
    *   Waiting to see how the market opens on **Sunday**.
    *   Monitoring overnight trading into the **9:30 AM** opening on **Monday** morning.
    *   Adopting a "wait and see" motive for the beginning of the new week.

### Hourly Chart (ES)

*   Note: Charts initially display **Electronic Trading Hours**. This will be addressed to show how to utilize both electronic and regular trading hours for a better understanding of price action.
*   Observations:
    *   Very smooth highs.
    *   **Fair Value Gap** present.
        *   Price rallied into this **Fair Value Gap**.
        *   Price then retraced back down into the **Buy-Side Imbalance Sell-Side Inefficiency (BISI)**.
        *   This classifies as a BISI within the PD array category of a **Fair Value Gap**.
    *   Another **Fair Value Gap** shaded in blue.
        *   This **Fair Value Gap** is a **Buy-Side Imbalance Sell-Side Inefficiency (BISI)**.
        *   A BISI is inefficient buy-side, meaning upside delivery.
        *   Price goes up and hits the BISI.
        *   Once that area is filled with upside delivery, it's ready to go to another discount array or sell-side liquidity.
    *   Didn't take out that low.
        *   Monitoring to see how this is addressed on **Sunday**.
        *   Ideal Scenario:
            *   Gap lower.
            *   Trade up to hit the low of this inefficiency.
            *   Then sharply move into the sell-side liquidity here.
        *   If accelerating to the downside, attention shifts to the refined area where sell-side liquidity is residing (as mentioned on the daily chart).
        *   Considering how far below those relative equal lows the price can go.
            *   That gap is a key area to watch.
        *   If accelerating through that, then look at areas below the lows (as mentioned on the Daily chart).

### In-Depth Discussion: Inefficiencies and Gaps

*   **Hourly Chart:** Now displays **Regular Trading Hours (RTH)**.
    *   Process: Toggled from electronic trading hours to regular trading hours.
        *   Regular trading hours reveal the gaps from the previous session to the next day's **9:30 AM** opening.
    *   **Opening Range:** The distance separating the settlement price of the previous day and the **9:30 AM** New York local time opening price.
        *   Acts and performs in the same manner as a **Weekly Volume Imbalance**.
*   **Price Gaps**: Think about how markets efficiently deliver price.
    *   Analogy: Using a paint roller to paint a wall.
        *   The white shaded area background represents a wall.
        *   The goal is to "paint" (fill) the little areas where paint needs to be applied.
        *   These areas are imperfections or inefficiencies.
    *   Inefficiency Example:
        *   Paint exists between two candle bodies.
        *   Between that opening price and that opening price, there's a separation of price delivery.
        *   These ranges are highlighted and extended.
            *   Homework: Observe these ranges on your charts and drop down to lower timeframes on electronic trading hours.
        *   Inefficiency:
            *   Distinct separation between these two candles' opening prices.
            *   You want to extend these ranges because they'll eventually be offered buy-side and sell-side.
            *   This means upside and downside delivery.
        *   In the example, there was only a partial delivery of upside, and then a drop.
            *   The real inefficiency that remains is from that opening price up to that opening price.
            *   Consider it as a paint roller moving up and down.
        *   From the opening price in that opening price up to the specified area, there has been offered delivery of price.
            *   There's a real separation between the high and that candle's opening price.
            *   There's a distinct inefficiency there.
        *   The market respected that opening price and treated it with these bodies.
        *   Another gap example provided.
        *   Inside these ranges, anticipate and expect price to deliver both sides (up and down).
            *   That's inefficiently delivered price.
        *   The market worked off the low, and there's another gap.
            *   The market wants to reach up into that.
        *   Study how price delivers inside these ranges by toggling between regular trading hours and electronic trading hours.
            *   It acts as dynamic support and resistance.
            *   Not readily understood or seen by most traders.
            *   It's not found in books.
            *   It's not simply supply and demand or classic support and resistance.
            *   Retail traders may see a gap, but they aren't looking at gaps multiple times in the future.
            *   Retail traders would consider the gap closed once price moves from one point to another, dismissing it.
            *   That's What Separates from retail traders:
                *   The algorithm will refer back to those three price points:
                    *   The low.
                    *   The consequent encroachment (midpoint of the gap).
                    *   The high.
                *   These three specific price points are very sensitive.
                *   For a more detailed approach:
                    *   Split that range up in quadrants:
                        *   First 25%.
                        *   50%.
                        *   75%.
                    *   Then the high of the inefficiency.
        *   Homework: Study electronic trading hours, look at all of the price action even though there are gaps of missing price data in regular trading hours.
            *   There's no gap in electronic trading hours.
            *   It's actually being traded through.
        *   Study how price delivers inside these ranges (referring to specific examples on the chart).
        *   Avoid having all of the inefficiencies on the chart simultaneously. This helps track what you are looking for.
        *   Study the time of day. Look for inefficiencies (think silver bullets) in the London session and in the New York session (both AM and PM sessions).
            *   The precision of these levels (high, low, consequent encroachment, 75%, 50%, and 25% of those respective ranges) will be surprising.
*   Homework Assignments (Based on Chart Examples): Study the 3 Key ranges shown on the chart.
    *   Toggle between regular trading hours and electronic trading hours to study how price delivers inside each range.
    *   Look for setups.
    *   Study time of day (London and New York sessions).
    *   Observe precision of levels (high, low, consequent encroachment, and the 25%, 50%, and 75% levels within each range).

### 15-Minute Timeframe (ES)

*   Revisiting the **One Setup for Life** tutorial on YouTube.
    *   Classifying specific liquidity pools.
    *   Breaking down and looking back at very specific points of liquidity.
    *   Referencing London session highs and London session lows.

    *   Sell-side liquidity pool.
    *   Thursday New York PM session Buy-Sell liquidity.
    *   London session Buy-Sell liquidity.
    *   Sell-side (London session for this day).
*   **Non-Farm Payroll Friday:**
    *   Opened, rallied up, took the buy-side on the Thursday New York PM session.
    *   Ripped lower to take out the London session.
    *   Rallied up one more time.
    *   Traded back down to a bullish order block and sharply moved higher, attacking the Thursday London session buy-side liquidity pool.

    *   Didn't take out that low.
        *   Unfinished business going into **Sunday's** openings.
        *   Ideal Scenario:
            *   Gap lower.
            *   Monitor how it trades lower, if at all, below that low.
            *   Mindful of a tiny gap that might cause a pullback before running for that low.
        *   If it does break lower, it could be a quick, sudden run.
        *   Be aware of that little gap that could cause a pullback before the low is taken out at a later time.

*   Thursday London session Buy Sell liquidity.
    *   Rallied up into that.
    *   Traded up into that low and then started to break lower.
    *   Aggressively moved towards the relative equal low side.

        *   Aggressive sell-off into sell-signed liquidity.
*   Opening Range: We close here and open down here. You would have that shaded so extending out in the future you can see we dug up into that as well again you would note that opening and the close respectively on these two candles and extend that range forward and you can see that's what we basically did here we stayed inside that range and then we got down here to that Gap that huge inefficiency.
    *   You don't want to just go right back to the previous sessions closing price where I like to usually do that if we have a breaker a breaker will many times disrupt that total closure of the gap.
*   How do I know certain gaps won't entirely close:
    *   There are certain things obviously that I've already taught you this is another one here.
    *   If there's a breaker inside the range that would be considered for a gap closure you want to consider where that down closed candles low is and you can see we have respected that here.

    *   Decision to trade NASDAQ because students asked about it.
    *   Went long and then short on NASDAQ.
    *   Didn't get the last run lower on the PM session.
    *   A recording exists of live executions on Friday's PM session for NASDAQ (upside and downside).
*   Short-term low helps time the potential intermediate-term high.
*   Trading Attempt:
    *   Tried to take a trade around a specific area on NASDAQ.
    *   Not going to show it here, but it will be included in tomorrow's macros lecture.
    *   Trying to show a losing trade (facetious attempt).
    *   Ended up making a profitable run, so the trade was closed.

        *   Buying here and getting out there just at that high is enough for a trade.
        *   No need to hold on to any of this up here in the PM session.
    *   Same Idea (in reverse):
        *   Consolidation
        *   Wait for displacement
        *   Energetic drop
        *   Reach for 4-5 handles minimum.
        *   A buy side area will many times want to offer a re-delivery to that as well because every old liquidity pool acts like an inefficiency it'll many times revisit it and act as the opposite.
        *   If we were seeing buy side as a draw here the algorithm will refer back to this area here and draw back down into it but it has to be some measure of why it was drawn to for buy side it's not just simply resistance resistance broken turn support because notice it didn't do anything for sport so I've already canceled that idea.
        *   Take this information and really understand what would be support to buy or a target for a draw on liquidity.
    *   A lot of lectures will describe how to do all this, but it can't be taught obviously in one sitting there's a lot of things that at my disposal and I want to make it available to you but everything a little bit at a time because it's already probably too much for most of you but we found something in this that was insightful and helpful and until I'll talk to you next time be safe.

# Time Elements in Algorithm Price Delivery & Introduction to ICT Macros

**Video URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXVJnBVizYY

## Introduction

This lesson focuses on **time elements** within algorithm price delivery and serves as an introduction to **ICT macros**. It's important to understand the context in which these macros are used.  This is an introductory lesson and may not answer every question initially. Many of these concepts are interconnected and require time and experience to fully grasp.

## NASDAQ Daily Chart Context

*   The lesson provides context based on how the ICT macro was used on **Friday, July 2023**. Knowing the specific times of day a macro occurs is insufficient without understanding the broader context.

## Bullish Order Block Analysis

### Down Close Candle and Wick

*   Take a look at this specific down close candle. Focus on a **wick** or tail.
*   When observing a wick, immediately identify the **midpoint**, referred to as **consequent encouragement**.
*   The algorithm often treats wicks as **gaps**.
*   On Friday, the market opened and traded higher, closing near the midpoint of the wick.

### Identifying Key Levels

*   Focus on the **high** and **open** of the candle.
*   This forms a **bullish order block** – price is contained within the high and opening price levels.
*   Specific price points (high and open) are utilized, not the mean threshold of the body or the entire high-to-low range.
*   This is based on the last down close candle *before* a rally.

### Propulsion Block

*   This specific order block is a **propulsion block**.
*   Refer to the **month four** content in the premium mentorship content on YouTube for the **"propulsion block"** lecture.
*   A propulsion block works off an earlier order block.
*   Price should *not* fall below half of the body of the earlier order block.
*   Since price doesn't break below this level, anticipate higher prices the following day.

## Anticipating Price Movement

### Pre-News Sentiment

*   Prior to the non-farm payroll release at 8:30 AM, it was indicated on Twitter that a preference for buy-side liquidity being taken first. (Refer to twitter.)

### Order Block Respect and Initial Rally

*   The propulsion block was respected on Thursday.
*   Expectations were for an initial rally higher, possibly challenging the high, but the extent of the move was uncertain.
*   Pre-news is often a guessing game.

### Manual Intervention and Whipsaw

*   Manual intervention frequently occurs after the 8:30 AM news release.
*   The market often targets both buy-side and sell-side liquidity before the "real" move.
*   This generally results in a whipsaw-type event.

### Level Association

*   Two specific levels on the down close candle are associated and respected with these two price points.

## Hourly Chart and Narrative

### Breakers and Narrative

*   The hourly chart shows a high-to-low after taking buy-side liquidity, resulting in an inefficiency.
*   Breakers might not provide clean rejection points during non-farm payroll, CPI, and FOMC events.
*   Under normal circumstances (e.g. high low higher high), a bearish breaker would be expected, but not during news events like non-farm payroll.
*   In these cases, the area should be treated as a balanced price range, but look for the breaker to be utilized.
*   This lesson incorporates not only time aspects but also **narrative**, which is essential to understanding macro behavior.

### Understanding Macro

*   Knowing the time is not a magic bullet; it requires understanding what price is likely to do.
*   This is complex and requires ongoing learning.
*   The rest of the year will include more macro lectures and notes in future books.

## Identifying Market Tendencies

### Inefficiencies

*   The market rallied up inside a premium inefficiency after the payroll release.
*   Price only rallies to go to inefficiencies, buy-side liquidity, consolidates and goes below to sell-side inefficiencies

### Fair Value Gaps

*   A fair value gap (FVG) and a city are identified on 15-minute chart.
*   The 15 minute fair value gap is inside the daily bullish propulsion block Wick.
*   The opening of that daily propulsion block where a couple minutes was spent explaining.
*   There is also an hourly fair value gap, which is the blue shaded area in the middle of the high in the opening of the propulsion block.

### Top-Down Analysis

*   Perform a top-down analysis from premium and discount PD arrays.
*   Identify what's above the market (inefficiency and liquidity – buy-side) and below the market (inefficiency and liquidity – sell-side).

### Liquidity and Inefficiency Targets

*   Look at previous day's highs and lows, session highs and lows, the highs and lows in the last three days and previous week high and low.
*   These are quick, easy references for where price will likely gravitate for inefficiencies or liquidity.

## Five-Minute Chart Analysis: Non-Farm Payroll

### Why NASDAQ

*   Focusing on NASDAQ, not because it's inherently better or tool-selected, but because students requested more NASDAQ analysis (as opposed to ES).
*   The NASDAQ example was chosen because students requested it.

### Bullish Propulsion Block Levels

*   Bullish propulsion block (wick high, opening price) and the hourly fair value gap (blue shaded area in the middle of the propulsion block's high and opening price) are highlighted.

### Consequent Encouragement

*   Half of the range between the high and wick of the propulsion block represents **consequent encouragement.**
*   Treat wicks/tails as gaps; the midpoint is consequent encouragement.
*   The market initially rallies, then drops below the lows, digging into order flow and specifically into the consequent encouragement of the bullish daily propulsion block.

### Market Manipulation and Trap

*   The market initially takes buy-side liquidity, trades into an inefficiency, then reverses to take sell-side liquidity.
*   Rallies for the buy side first traps traders that are long and want to see it keep going higher and then the market trades lower and takes out the sell stops and induce new shorts crush the longs, trap them short, accumulate the sell side and then run for the buy side and the other higher time frame drawn liquidity.

### Note on Non-Farm Payroll Behavior

*   During a non-farm payroll event, whichever side of the market is targeted first is *usually* the false run.
*   Example: Initial rally for buy-side traps longs, then the market trades lower, taking out sell stops.

## Bullish Order Block on Five Minute Chart

### Identifying the Order Block

*   Candlestick highlighted is another bullish order block.
*   Same principle as the daily chart: high to wick to the opening.
*   A small gap (fair value gap) is present within the order block.
*   This suggests potential for higher prices after stops have been taken.

## Three-Minute Chart Refinement

### Fair Value Gap Refinement

*   Within the order block, the gap is refined further.
*   Candle bodies generally respect the gap before moving higher.

### Inversion Fair Value Gap (iFVG)

*   An inefficiency (inversion fair value gap) is identified.
*   Order flow is bullish, stops have been taken and a draw is set here.
*   The imbalance is traded up into, then treated as support.

## One-Minute Chart and Time Considerations

### Asset Class Time Characteristics

*   Think about how the characteristics of time are very unique to price delivery but across all asset classes.
*   The following information displays how price action is internalized regardless of asset class.
*   Whether it’s Forex, commodities, or index futures, specific timeframes are key.
*   The same premise is used to observe price action for all assets.

### Key Time Zones and Macros

*   Awareness of the following:
    *   **7:00 AM - 9:00 AM New York Open Killzone (Forex)**
    *   **8:30 AM - Noon New York AM Session (Index)**
    *   **10:00 AM - 11:00 AM AM Silver Bullet**
    *   **Macros:** Specific segments of price action, usually 20-minute intervals. (A few macros will be taught this year).

### Macro Application

*   There is price running up during non-farm payroll into that inefficiency.
*   It drops aggressively, takes out sell-side liquidity below relative equal lows, then returns into that hourly fair value gap (blue shaded area).
*   It rallies again, comes back down, touches the high end of the hourly fair value gap, then rises into the inefficiency and takes by-side once more.
*   It leaves weak relative equal lows.
*   Consequent encouragement of the high and the opening price in the bullish propulsion block is important to note.
*   Those two respective levels, high and opening. Half of that is consequent encouragement.

### Addressing Complexity

*   The topic may seem overwhelming because markets are driven by high-frequency algorithms and are not designed to be easily understood.
*   The teaching style is lengthy and can be difficult.
*   Understanding this is not easy; simplified approaches may be inaccurate.

## Understanding Market Movement

### Non-Farm Payroll Dynamics

*   A typical non-farm payroll event involves an initial run (buy-side), then a sell-side move. Time becomes a factor.

### Sell-Side Targeting

*   Sell-side liquidity is taken when price trades below relative equal lows and into the bullish propulsion block's consequent encouragement (from the daily chart).

### Chart Clarity

*   Things are written out in text format and numerical levels on a notepad to clearly display what things are.
*   This chart setup is used for explanation purposes; charts are typically kept clean and empty.

### Sound Logic

*   Everything is based on sound logic, not random observations.
*   There is reasoning behind explaining the marketplace.

## Ten O'Clock Hour

### Ten Minute Interval

*   Prior to 10 o'clock is a 10 minute interval which is 9:50 to 10:10.

# Understanding ICT Macros: Time-Based Algorithm Behavior

## Introduction

This lesson delves into **ICT macros**, focusing on specific 20-minute time periods during which algorithmic price action is often observed. It’s designed to demonstrate the level of detail the algorithm uses for timing movements related to liquidity and inefficiencies. For first-time viewers, the concepts may appear cherry-picked initially; reviewing shared Twitter videos showing real-time executions during these times is recommended. The lesson showcases recent examples, including the **10:50 to 11:10** and **9:50 to 10:10 macros**.

## Macro Timeframes and Market Context

*   The **20-minute macro** period specializes in the market's behavior as it approaches the first 30 minutes of trading *after* the equities market opens at **9:30 AM**.
*   This timing is relevant not only to equities but also to Forex and futures markets. All these markets are interconnected, creating a tapestry where harmonious movement is expected. A break in correlation can signal an impending shift or abrupt change. This concept, though significant, is beyond the current scope.

## Macro-Driven Price Action: An Example

### Scenario

*   Consider a scenario where price runs up into an inefficiency during the **9:50 to 10:10 macro**, targeting buy-side liquidity. A single down candle drives this movement.

### Functions

*   This action serves two primary functions:
    *   Delivers price to an area deemed premium relative to the high and low.
    *   Rebalances an inefficiency.

### Identifying Balance

*   The rebalancing is confirmed by price working back and forth within the inefficiency. The bodies of the candlesticks remain inside this range, respecting it. This behavior forms part of the narrative and is crucial for understanding candlesticks, beyond simple pattern recognition.

### Subsequent Price Movement

*   After the rally, price drops lower during the **9:50 to 10:10** period, having already interacted with the liquidity.
*   The next objective is to deliver price to the opposite side of the market.
*   Given a bullish bias on the S&P and NASDAQ and the presence of relative equal lows, the expectation is a move to take out sell-side liquidity.

### Liquidity Engineering

*   The algorithm engineers liquidity using an hourly fair value gap and trades down into the midpoint (consequent encouragement) of the daily propulsion block.
*   The complexity here can feel overwhelming for new traders, but understanding this level of detail isn't essential for basic trading.
*   This information aims to demonstrate how the algorithm references specific points when timing movements related to liquidity and inefficiencies.

## Time and Market Dynamics

### Key Overlaps

*   Consider the **New York Open Kill Zone**. The majority of this period is typically quiet.
*   At **8:30 AM**, the non-farm payroll release introduces an inefficiency.
*   This coincides with the overlap of the **9:30 AM** equities open and the New York Open Kill Zone, creating volatility.

### Price Action Sequence

1.  Price drops briefly, leaving an inefficiency.
2.  A further drop trades into the hourly fair value gap.
3.  Price fluctuates before trading back up into the inefficiency during the **9:50 to 10:10 macro**.
4.  The market then begins its move lower to target liquidity.

### AM Silver Bullet

*   This overall movement occurs during the **AM Silver Bullet** (**10:00 to 11:00 AM**) and the New York AM session (**8:30 AM to Noon**).

### Execution Clues

*   Monitoring for "speed" and looking for large candles, indicating sharp drops or strong rallies, are key when executing trades during these times.

## Macro Mechanics Explained

### Macro Functionality

*   The **9:50 to 10:10** macro specializes in capturing the initial 20-40 minutes of the trading hour that begins at **9:30 AM**.
*   The first 30 minutes after the stock market bell rings at **9:30 AM** constitutes the opening range. The range's high and low, even if formed in just 20 minutes, are useful for determining likely future price movements. Additional teachings on the opening range will be provided.
*   The run that begins at **9:30 AM** extends into the liquidity during the **9:50 to 10:10** macro.

### Macro Directives

*   A macro is a short list of directives the algorithm executes to seek liquidity and/or inefficiencies.
*   In this example, the algorithm has already moved into a premium relative to the high and low, targeting an inefficiency and buy-side liquidity. Thus, two functions of price delivery have been fulfilled for seeking liquidity and inefficiencies, balancing the market.

### Directional Context

*   The critical question is *why* price isn't continuing higher; *why* isn't this a bull flag?
*   The answer lies in understanding the parameters of buy-side and sell-side liquidity and incorporating the expected profile of non-farm payroll.
    *   Typically, non-farm payroll involves an initial rally, followed by a drop to take out stops before resuming the upward trend, *or* a drop to take out sell-side liquidity before rallying to take out buy-side liquidity, *or* simply a choppy, indecisive pattern.

### Silver Bullet Entry

*   During the peak of the **10:00 to 11:00 AM** Silver Bullet window, price drops, trading down to the consequent encouragement of the bullish propulsion block on the daily chart, also coinciding with the consequent encouragement of the hourly fair value gap.
*   Following this, a short-term high is pierced, revealing another order block. Touching another hourly order block, the market stops perfectly at the opening price of the down-closed candle within the green-shaded higher timeframe order block (from high to opening price).

### 10:50 to 11:10 Macro

*   A rally then forms during the **10:50 to 11:10** macro. The significance of **10:50 to 11:10** is that it marks the end of the **10:00 to 11:00 AM** hour, the first 90 minutes of trading, leading into the New York lunch period.

### Lunch Hour Dynamics

*   Although open outcry is no longer present and markets are electronic, the markets still tend to enter a consolidation phase during lunch.
*   The lunch hour can perform three primary functions: consolidate, run for liquidity, or reverse. These actions must fit within the market profile for the specific day. Given the non-farm payroll event, the initial buy-side run engineered sell-side liquidity before dropping for sell-side liquidity.

### Market Participants

*   With no one left in long positions (having been stopped out) and short positions trapped (from breakouts below relative equal lows), the market is now free to move higher.

### Key Takeaway

*   These time windows, or macros, are simply a time aspect for anticipating when the market will begin to exhibit specific behaviors, such as running for liquidity or inefficiency.

## Trading Applications & Caveats

### Movement

*   Within these times, there are specific opportunities to anticipate phenomena in price, aligning with expected behavior to reach for liquidity or inefficiency.
*   If macros don't provide the expected timing and the market doesn't react, it’s often a signal to stop trading for that session because the market is behaving algorithmically.

### Spooling Events

*   A macro represents the beginning of a "spooling event," where price starts reaching, much like casting a fishing line. These macros are like casting price away, higher or lower, observed at specific times.

### Macros

*   Macros *do not* provide directional bias.
*   Information about how "the macro here" dictates a buy or sell bias is misleading.

### Prerequisites

*   A comprehensive understanding of other teachings is necessary, including tape reading, determining bias, identifying liquidity, and utilizing higher timeframe analysis. Without this foundational knowledge, the macros will be ineffective and potentially frustrating.

### Algo

*   It’s crucial to understand that the markets are algorithmic and operate on time. Time is a critical factor *before* price moves. Markets aren't random; they're not driven by large numbers of buyers or sellers, Reddit users, or attempts to take down hedge funds. All asset classes are influenced by artificial intelligence, algorithms, and instructions coded to run based on time.

### Example

*   The provided executions demonstrate how this information is used in trading, showcasing entries and exits over the course of the day.

## Conclusion

The lesson demonstrates the algorithmic nature of the markets and their reliance on time-based execution. Understanding macros requires a solid foundation in broader trading concepts. If the market doesn’t respect these time measures, it signals a potential bailout, advising traders to refrain from engaging that session, potentially preventing drawdown or losing trades.

*   **Fair Value Gap:** Discussion on the weekly chart's fair value gap.
    *   Noted that price could move through it.
    *   Anticipated a draw to the sell-side below.
*   **Specific Levels:**
    *   Price was one tick short of the high of the gap.
    *   Week beginning April 11, 2022.
    *   Week beginning March 28, 2022: High of that candle.
    *   Fair Value Gap = "Say Five, Seven, Balance, Outside, Inefficiency"
*   **Looking Ahead:** Watch to see if price digs into the fair value gap this week.
*   The analysis from the previous week (July 9th) proved to be "very explosive."

    *   This was the area where the week had closed.
    *   The market opened and traded up into the breaker.
*   **Mean Threshold:**
    *   Low to high midpoint of the breaker.
    *   Order blocks: midpoint = mean threshold.
    *   Gaps/Inefficiencies: midpoint = consequent encroachment.

## **Addressing Misconceptions & Clarifications**

*   **Comment Section & Privacy:** The comment section is set for review. Comments are considered personal messages.
    *   This is to protect those with "hurt feelings" from the "adoration shared" towards the speaker.
    *   The speaker has shown in the past why comments are kept private.
*   **Sell-Side vs. Support:** Clarification that teaching sell-side is NOT the same as calling it support.
    *   The market will "draw to that liquidity to it and through it."
    *   Buy-side is not resistance; it's a draw on liquidity for markets going higher.
    *   The goal is to tap into buy-side liquidity above old highs, relative equal highs, or single highs.
*   **Rejection of Support and Resistance:** Support and resistance are considered "garbage."
    *   Dynamic support/resistance is based on inefficiencies and gaps.
*   **Gap Usage:** Gaps aren't filled and done away with; the market often reverts to old gaps' high, low, or consequent encroachment.
*   **Trading Methodology:**
    *   No trading in supply and demand zones with ambiguous buy/sell decisions.
    *   Three specific price levels are examined.
    *   Four gradients used to determine if inefficiency will provide a "means of staving off continuation."
    *   Levels used as either targets or entries.
*   **Attack Old Lows:** Not trying to find reasons to buy at lows.
    *   Teaching to anticipate that retail traders will buy there, and those already long will have stop orders below.
    *   Short position with a buy below those lows for targets beyond.
*   **Breaker and Weekly Fair Value Gap:** The market hit the breaker and worked off the weekly fair value gap.
*   **Transpose Weekly Inefficiencies:** Recommended to transpose weekly inefficiencies onto the daily chart to maintain context.
    *   Reason: The weekly fair value gap "doesn't look like a gap at all" on the daily chart.

There were many smaller entries to be utilized. This is ok to not be seen yet as viewers are still learning.
*   **Fast Market:** Market was very fast due to fundamental changes in money transfer.
*   **Homework:**
    *   Overlay a Fibonacci retracement on the weekly volume imbalance (high to low).

*   **Support & Resistance as Religion:** The speaker refers to Support and resistance as religion.
*   **Cult of S&R:** The speaker states if you say were a cult, the idea of support and resistance you have to have more faith in that than simply understanding that what I'm teaching here is the real market.

### **Objectivity vs. Subjectivity**

*   **Fair Value Gap Objectivity:** Fair value gap in the form of a bison or balance outside efficiency that does not hide from you and there's not other ones in this area that you might get tricked by, therefore, it's objective.
*   **S&R Subjectivity:** On the other hand, the idea of picking a support resistance idea based on classic support and resistance Theory what high are you going to use what low are you going to use what what diagonal trend lines are you going to draw to and which one's going to be correct which makes it very subjective.
*   **Personal Experience:** The speaker has wasted lots of money doing that stuff as well as other people that have traded before I was even born.
*   **Appearance vs. Reality:** But hey it looks great in the books it looks great in hindsight look at this level here this diagonal support this diagonal resistance.
*   **Phantom Trendline:** The speaker created a concept that attacks that idea that entire premise, my phantom trend line.

# Institutional Order Flow: A Critical Examination

**Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN2BkfyRWE4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN2BkfyRWE4)

## Introduction

Welcome back, folks! This discussion and lecture focuses on **institutional order flow**. This discussion was prompted by the increasing interest in order flow using the **DOM (Depth of Market)** and **footprint charts**, seen in the comments and emails.

**Disclaimer:**
I borrowed this concept of discussing this topic from another YouTuber. I am not implying anything negative about them. This is not meant to create drama.

## The Appeal of DOM and Footprint Charts

Many new traders are drawn to the **DOM** (displayed on the left) and **footprint charts** (displayed in the middle) due to their perceived technical sophistication. The detailed data and visual representation can appear impressive and make traders feel more informed. I understand the appeal; when I was newer to trading, I would have been excited to add these tools on top of every other indicator I had to make myself feel smarter and more informed.

## Questioning the Necessity of DOM and Footprint Charts

*   If you are new to my content, the concepts may seem daunting, but that's because you are rushing through the process. If I were to ask you what you should do with all this data, how would you use it?

*   While some individuals, including friends and students, successfully use these tools in conjunction with my teachings, I **don't believe they are necessary**.

*   These tools are akin to any other indicator and rely on a **faith-based premise**.

*   If you are uneasy watching this discussion, please turn it off. This discussion aims to answer the question of whether these tools are truly essential for trading.

## Spoofing and Manipulation

The **DOM** displays orders, but these can be **spoofed**. **Spoofing** involves placing orders above or below the market price and then quickly removing them before they are filled. This creates a false impression of buying or selling interest. How is this advantageous for a trader who must still determine if the market will move from the current market price to a previous support or resistance level?

Despite these tools, traders still face the same fundamental challenge: **predicting market direction**.

## The Problem with "No Prediction" Claims

There is a trend of educators and influencers claiming that traders **don't need to predict the market**. This claim, in my opinion, is nonsensical.

*   If using the **DOM**, one must assume whether the market is more likely to fall into orders below the market or rise to orders above the market.
*   I am not concerned with two- or three-handle trades. I am interested in where the market will reach to, and I teach my students to focus on this.

## The Importance of Directional Bias

**Level 2 data** still requires having an opinion on market direction. This opinion, like any analysis, can be incorrect. The first rule I teach my students is to **identify where the market is most likely to move to** - higher or lower. The depth of market may imply there are more buyers or sellers; **it's more likely** that the market will move in that direction, **but it does not mean it will**

Even with the **DOM** displaying stacked orders, the justification for believing the market will move in that direction relies on having a directional bias. For me, these tools are a **crutch.**

*   If you feel these tools help you focus on sticking to one side of the market, that's fine.

*   Using these tools *solely* to determine buy or sell decisions is **myopic**.

*   The presence of these tools on institutional trading floors is **irrelevant**; the market still presents the puzzle of predicting direction.

I teach my students to focus on **where the most likely draw on liquidity is**, not on the minute details of the footprint or **DOM**.

## The Influence of "FinTwit"

Watching some FinTwit influencers use **DOM** tools, I don't see them being all that helpful. Even when the market direction is clear, they can be misled by the apparent strength of orders at certain price levels.
My assumption is that you are allowing the market to be seen visually in chart form. Yes, there are many advantages to using a time-based chart if you understand what I am teaching.

## Final Thoughts on Using These Tools

*   If these tools help you and you are profitable, that's perfectly fine.
*   Don't let my opinions discourage you if they are beneficial to your trading.
*   You may grow out of them, or they may become a permanent part of your strategy.
*   As long as they help you focus and trust your model, there's no issue.

However, claiming that these tools represent **institutional order flow** is inaccurate. They report numbers that can be spoofed. Orders can appear and disappear, making the data unreliable.

**Spoofing** is a real issue. Trading firms are regularly fined for it. If the data can be easily manipulated, how can you trust it?
The interpretation of the data may lead retail traders to believe the market will move towards a certain price, but that's not guaranteed.

I am sure that some users will say that this works for them. But, I can go on a live stream and show my style running circles around these tools.

## Comparing and Contrasting Approaches

It's important to understand what I focus on in my teaching. If others pressure you and say you're not learning real order flow, that's true because it's not necessary.

Think about the name: "**footprint**." It shows what has *already* happened – the number of orders at a particular price in the past. I focus on **predicting** where price is going.

*   I teach to predict where price is going to go and the draw on liquidity above or below the marketplace. It's going to go up to take out buy stops or to reprice to an inefficiency, some kind of fair value gap.

*   Not every market will have all of my specific PD arrays, but you must consider the ones that are present and know how to navigate them.

If you are bearish, you would naturally look for confirmation in the **DOM** showing more orders below the market.
**These tools are middlemen**. They can be helpful initially if you're unfamiliar with price action. However, my PD arrays are always *ahead* of the information provided by these tools.

In the July 9, 2023 analysis, before the market opened, I precisely predicted price delivery without relying on these tools.

## Conclusion

While these tools measure real-time transactions, the number of buyers or sellers at a specific price and the stack of orders on the **DOM** have **no bearing on future price direction**. The market often remains stagnant when these tools become popular. The transition from open outcry to electronic trading led to hype around level 2 data, but it hasn't created a wave of newly rich traders.

When I say "**institutional order flow**," I'm not referring to these tools. I don't teach this because I have no faith in it.
You may find it helpful, and that's fine, but I've completely cut it out of my analysis.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, formatted for clarity, readability, and retention of all details.

### Institutional Order Flow: A Contrasting Perspective

I have friends in this industry and students who use **DOM** and **footprint charts** in conjunction with my teachings, and they are profitable. I am not here to say these tools *don't* work. What I am doing is drawing a stark contrast between what I mean by "**institutional order flow**" and what these tools represent.

#### Moving into Discussion: NASDAQ Case Study

We will now look at a case study on **NASDAQ**. I'm going to spare you level two data because it is not required or necessary.

*   Think about how I teach.
*   Consider the numerous examples I’ve shown *before the fact* of where the market is going and how it will get there.

I don't say, "Here we are at point A; I believe it's *maybe* going to get up to point B." I state, "This is where I think the draw of liquidity is."

*   This signifies a directional bias, making my expectations known publicly beforehand.
*   These are not two-pip or five-handle expectations; these are well-considered price moves.
*   I'm not utilizing anything classically lumped into order flow.
*   When I say "trading with institutional order flow," I'm seeing institutional order flow in price action.
    *   I've covered this before, but this presentation goes deeper.
    *   Consider the *lack* of required tools; other traders feel they *have* to have these tools, while I use nothing on my chart except a candlestick chart.

All that is needed is:

*   To see what time it is.
*   To know where we are in the range.

#### The Importance of Draw on Liquidity and Directional Bias

The number one thing is **draw on liquidity**. I was bullish, as mentioned last Sunday (July 9, 2023). Today is July 16th, 2023, at the time of this recording. On July 9th, 2023, I outlined my expectation of:

*   Higher prices on E-mini S&P and NASDAQ.
*   Higher prices on Euro/Dollar.
*   Lower prices on the Dollar Index.

It was a clean sweep; everything delivered as expected. These were not small moves; they were rather large.

I want to explain in detail why I believed NASDAQ would go higher.

#### Weekly Chart Analysis: Mitigation Block

*   Look at the chart (upper left-hand corner): This is the weekly chart.
*   This candle is a **mitigation block**.
    *   I don't talk about it much, but it's basically the opposite of a breaker, though both are still mitigation in essence.
    *   We have a high, a low, and a higher high (no lower high).
    *   That low between it is a mitigation block.
    *   If this high here was taken out with a higher run, then that would be a bearish breaker.
        *   Bearish breakers are much stronger in terms of resistance than a mitigation block.
        *   A mitigation block can be traded through.
    *   In terms of how I use mitigation blocks, I typically side with using them as targets more so than entries because they *can* be traded through.
    *   Breakers are pretty formidable in the path of price action. That doesn't mean they *can't* be broken.
        *   I *have* had losing trades using a breaker.
    *   Mitigation blocks are better used for targeting purposes.

I was using this one with the expectation that NASDAQ could try to gravitate towards it if it were to go any higher (this small little area) and, obviously, the buy side above it.

I am *not* calling a high in the NASDAQ or ES. You've heard me emphatically state many times that I am not calling a high, and it's important for you not to try to do that, either. The market just keeps drilling higher, grinding down anyone who wants to sell short.

I believe there's no justification for the markets to be where they are, at least for equities. Stocks *should not* be trading where they're at, but we have to trust order flow.

#### Defining Order Flow

What kind of order flow? The things I showed you in the beginning of this presentation? I *don't* subscribe to those things. I don't have any faith in them. My faith is based on where I believe the market's going to go.

*   I believe I'm good at predicting where price is going to go because I have experience doing it and tools to help me.
*   I can see where orders are going to be *anyway*, before your ladders (depth of market) or footprint confirm what I and my students already expect in terms of price delivery.
    *   We already know there's going to be buying and selling between the two price points that we're at; that's a given.

Knowing where the market is going to go is a directional bias. Unless you trade options in your delta neutral, you *have* to have a directional bias. If we're trading futures and trying to be a buyer or seller, if you're going long, then you have a bias that's going higher.

Why argue with that? Why call it something it's not? You're predicting price. Then say, "We don't need to predict the future price direction." Well, yes, you do if you want to be profitable, or at least consistently profitable. You *have* to have an understanding of where the market can gravitate towards. That's what I teach my students.

Knowing where price is likely to go is the first thing they learn. If you don't have that skill set, you will *not* be consistently profitable. Period. End of story.

My opinion was, at the beginning of the week, I wanted to see us gravitate towards this mitigation block. It would be above the relative equal highs here that had already been cleared.

*   We consolidated.
*   It was more likely we were going to expand higher.
*   It reached into the mitigation block; it actually closed right on it.

Ahead of the week open on Sunday, July 9, 2023, we were expecting price to go higher.

#### Daily Chart Analysis

*   This candle is on the candlestick chart (lower left-hand corner).
*   This is a daily chart of the NASDAQ.
*   Everything I'm teaching you here works on every asset class.

I would not do anything differently. If you are frustrated because I'm not talking about Forex like I did before, I'm teaching through this medium here because this is where I actually got started in 1992; I was a commodity trader. Later, I transitioned to Forex. There are a lot of things that prevent me from wanting to trade Forex, so that's why I'm teaching with this medium.

Everything I'm teaching you here with futures index trading works in Forex, commodity trading, gold, and metals. My students have been profitable trading crypto using this information.

If we see this down-closed candle, if you look at the weekly chart, there's a small fair value gap right in there. That's this one here on the daily. The market traded higher there.

#### Propulsion Blocks

We have this down-closed candle, which is right above and digging into this down-closed candle. This is an older block; it's bullish. This is a **propulsion block**.

*   Propulsion blocks are order blocks by themselves.
*   The way you differentiate what they are and how they're used is: this down-closed candle digs into a previous down-closed candle.
*   For propulsion blocks, you *never* want to see a closing price below mean threshold.

Mean threshold on our order block is the 50% level. We wicked down through it but then closed here.

*   This one here, we wicked down through it and closed right here.
*   We wicked down through it and closed up here.

Yes, we had movement through the mean threshold, but we didn't *close* below it, so that still keeps this down-closed candle valid as a propulsion block.

Monday's trading – all of this movement was just returning back into this gap, this tail, and this candlestick. We treat wicks and tails on candlesticks as gaps.

*   The midpoint of that gap or tail on that candle is consequent encroachment.
*   Extend out in time; that's exactly where we were trading on Monday.

It did not violate the rules that make a propulsion block invalid. The market closes here, and now we open the next day. We open, trade down, rally back up, and have it. The next two days, we had news; we had pretty good economic calendar events for the rest of the week, and it sent price parabolic above the relative equal highs.

*   The draw on liquidity is the weekly chart mitigation block.
*   We're not going to say that the actual price was 15,693, but we're just going to use it for the sake of discussion because I don't know it off the top of my head what the actual price was.

You're invited to do that in your own study. Don't just take what I show and talk about in the video; you need to go in there and weigh out whether your charts show you the same thing because you want your own proof. You don't want to just take my word on anything. Challenge yourself and challenge my observations. Was it really there in the chart? You know, just taking my word for anyone else's word for anything is not something you should do, especially investing in financial advice.

This movement here was fully expected. We were expecting this bullishness and higher prices on NASDAQ when you're expecting it. We look for things to start or instigate a price rally higher or a price decline lower, and we frame it on the basis of where are we at right now versus where is it likely to go.

If we think that the price is going to gravitate up to this area and we'll call it 15,693.75, if we start the week here (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday), we expect each daily candle to gravitate towards that level. Even if you didn't pick that level, if you felt that this fair value gap was a reason to keep going higher, that's fine. There's nothing wrong with that, but this mitigation block is below that fair value gap. If you are using the relative equal highs as a drawing liquidity, there's nothing wrong with that, either.

*   We are primarily looking for the expansion either higher or lower on the weekly candlestick that sets our bias for the week.

Is it more likely to see where price was consolidating here? Is it more likely it's going to drop down after we've already went into this fair value gap here? We already did that, and then we consolidated here the previous week, and then we start a new week here, trade down a little bit, and then reject it, which is all that rejection is based on this consequent correction, this daily candle right there. That's where the low of the week was formed.

*   This is primed to just expand higher and aggressively above these relative equal highs on the daily chart.
*   There are buy orders resting above that.

Markets don't top like this.

#### Concluding Remarks and Risk-On Scenario

Since the weekly and daily chart are showing this pattern, it's more likely to go higher, especially since we were bearish on the dollar - exceedingly bearish, expecting it to reach for a larger pool of sell-side liquidity.

If that is the case, that means it's definitely a risk-on scenario, meaning all assets have the likelihood to go higher. Euro, pound, gold – all other asset classes are free to move higher because it's risk-on, and we saw a huge risk-on event this past week where most asset classes went up while the dollar crashed.

#### Hourly Chart Analysis: Propulsion Block and Market Structure

On the hourly chart, I want you to notice this little shaded area; that's the **propulsion block** (this whole range here), but visible on an hourly chart.

*   We have relative equal lows here; we drop down into it.
*   We trade above this short-term high right there.
*   That's all it needs to do; that's a **shift in market structure**.
    *   It doesn't need to *close* above it; it just now sets the thing in motion that we're going higher.
    *   It doesn't mean you can't have retracements, but look where it retraces.
*   If you take this propulsion block right here and you divide it in half, that's mean threshold.
    *   That's what this drop was going to.
    *   It's cleaning up these smooth edges in the bodies.

The bodies tell you the story; that's the narrative. The wicks do all the damage; that's the stuff that everybody gets hurt by. You get stopped out, and you don't want to go back into the marketplace; that's their purpose.

Reading price action with a time-based chart and focusing on the *bodies* of the candles... If you just saw these right here like this, and there were no wicks or tails on their candlesticks, if you took that completely off your chart, this would look like smooth edges, and that's all this was trading down into mean threshold, which is the entire range from high to low split that in half.

*   Digging into it after we had a shift in market structure.
*   That's slightly higher high than this one because we've had sell-side taken.
*   Now we have buy-side; we're bullish.

We have now met the minimum criteria for high-probability directional bias, so now we can absolutely predict higher prices. We can trust that higher prices are likely to go where – up in here, this mitigation block.

If we're looking for a 15,693 level, and we're down here, and we drop down to mean threshold, at that point, does the market want to rally away from it? Looks like it does. It tries one more time, digs into it, but look where the bodies are showing; they're showing it's respecting that propulsion block right there. We've already did the damage; we're going down into it. Here, bodies are supporting the high end of the propulsion block (that shaded area), and then we want to see, does the market want to rally?

*   If you're looking at depth of market or footprint, you're going to start seeing all the things that would justify the market wanting to go higher. We *already* knew that.

#### Conclusion

From here, as soon as we get these candlesticks showing this, and this candlestick closes, the next candle here, and it drops down and touches this, the high of this blue shaded area, which is this candle, that range on the daily chart, we're working with the hourly chart. I know that we're likely to go higher, where we have all this sell-side imbalanced buy-side inefficiency. This candlestick's low, and then we have the buy-side above this high here, there are buy stops resting above that, but this also is another pattern; it's a breaker.

Everyone that uses depth of market uses a footprint; they're going to be looking for justifications to go higher or lower. The folks that would be looking at it with the expectation that the market's going to go higher, the evidence that they're seeking will be...


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, formatted for clarity, readability, and retention of all details.

### Institutional Order Flow: A Contrasting Perspective (Continued)

The following expands on the speaker's view of institutional order flow and its application.

#### The Limitations of Traditional Order Flow Tools

There, every instance of it would be reflected in those tools. I don't need to see that. I already know that the Market's going to go towards these levels. It's driven that way, not because of buying and selling pressure. I have already arrived at these ideas before the markets even opened up, before the market even printed its first book on Sunday's opening. We had already codified the expectation that these markets were going to go higher, and to where. There was no need, there was no way for me to look at depth of Market or a footprint to justify those things because the market hadn't already done anything yet. So, while the markets were static, using experience, using institutional order flow, reading the tea leaves, okay, reading price action.

*   For the folks out there who say, you know, if you're reading the tape – who said this is reading take, folks?
*   You're watching price and how it gyrates off of my PD arrays. *That's* reading the tape.

When someone says, "Show me your order book, show me your order book," that's the stuff at the beginning of this video that I don't need.

*   Before your order book, before your depth of Market, before your ladder in your footprint tools start telling you anything, I have already—I'm light years ahead.

The footprint, that's something that has happened. This is where the buyers were; this is how many orders were bought and sold at these specific levels. Okay, that's wonderful. That's wonderful history. I loved it when I was in school, but who has a better perspective, folks?

*   Someone that's ahead of you on the path that you're walking right now.
*   Someone that is a quarter mile up the road.
    *   They've already walked this path multiple times, many times.
    *   They know the terrain.
    *   They know where the sticks are and the Thorns are.

Who has the better perspective?

*   You, as an inexperienced student of the marketplace?
*   Someone that's new?
    *   Maybe you started in 2015.
    *   You're looking back and wondering, can you trust these tools?

When I'm ahead of you in experience, and I can read these charts without any of that stuff, and I know where you're going to see new buying entries, you're going to see retracements that take out liquidity, you're going to see inefficiencies and how they're going to use those inefficiency, and I've proven this numerous times with live executions. I've called the market minute by minute live on a live stream, not pre-recorded. You have all sat there and watched me do this. That is reading the tape. I don't need these gimmicks to talk about what's happened already. I don't need to see that order book. I'm going to tell you where the Market's going to go before the order books talk about it. That's what my students are able to do. You may not have that skill set yet. You will over time. It doesn't happen overnight. It doesn't happen real quick, but I promise you, the idea of these things that are being promoted as this is institutional order flow, it's *not* institutional order flow.

*   All you're seeing is a glorified time and date stamp, time and sales.
*   That's it. That's all you're seeing.
*   It's a repackaged edition of that same information.

That's wonderful. That's wonderful for data collection and and studying, okay? It's wonderful, but you still are left with the puzzle of where is Price going to go higher or lower? And in between where we are at market price, how will it behave?

#### Simplified Price Action Analysis: A Contrasting Approach

Well, let's talk about that. If this is the propulsion block, and we've already seen it dig down into here, I'm not looking at ladders. I'm not looking at depth of Market. I'm not going to look at that level two data. I'm not looking at anything harmonic. I'm not looking at animal patterns. I'm not looking at Elliott wave. I'm not looking again I'm not looking at anything but this price action right here. Now, what's more simplified: trying to determine the efficacy of of footprint a depth of market and then not trading with the expectation of predicting price? To me, that's that's Insanity. Like, how could you possibly know what to do? And then it's not surprising when you see everybody out there that are trying to live stream and use these tools, they fumble, or they're not very confident when it is discussing what it is they want to do.

#### Confidence vs. Arrogance in Trading

One of the things I get challenged with is, you know, I I'm arrogant. No, I'm confident. And my students that are profitable that know what they're doing, they're confident, and it seems like arrogance the people that can't do it. I'm just trying to communicate to you in a manner where I don't want you to view me as trying to be arrogant. I want you to learn how to do this yourself. If I was trying to hold it back from you, then I could see your argument, but I'm trying my best to teach it to you, and I'm trying to disarm you for those that are standing here trying to arm wrestle me and say, you know, this is fake, or you don't know what you're doing, and it's always hindsight when I have literally scores of executions and live streams where I've called these things before they happen, and your ladders and your depth of market and all this footprint stuff hasn't even spoke to you yet. I'm light years ahead. I'm ahead of you in the path, okay?

#### The Journey of Learning and Market Perspective

I'm looking back at you. I know where I've come from. I've been exactly where all of you are. I've been there, and I understand how confusing it is, and you're trying to determine what you're supposed to do with this information. It's a lot of stuff to understand. I understand that's normal. I didn't say it was going to be easy, but I will make it easy, and how I'm teaching you this year, there's no other way to simplify it. There really isn't. It says you have to keep doing it for a while, and you'll learn how to do it, but when I look back at you as someone that's starting, I have the advantage of knowing how price will deliver. I know how Market structure will use specific things that I've dubbed PD arrays. You don't know where they're going to form or how they're going to form. I do, and I've proven that with live streams, live with the lowest latency that YouTube can permit. So, there's no excuses, there's absolutely no arguments, there's none.

#### The Irrelevance of Order Books to the Speaker's Methodology

Order books are not advantageous to me. I don't need those things, and if you're learning how to do what it is I'm teaching you, you don't need those tools either. But if you want to use them to help you, and you find advantages in using it, that's wonderful. I'm not going to tell you to put it down.

#### Reading Price Action: Bodies vs. Wicks

But if we're expecting price to go up to this blue line, and we're seeing evidence that all these things down here stops have been taken is swept, we have all these bodies here, which is relative equal lows forget the Wicks, go back into the bodies, they're telling you the narrative, that's the storyline, that means they're going to want to sweep through it, there you go, it's happening right there. So, when this is a full my bearish candle, I would be buying that. You probably wouldn't. Most people on YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram, and Discord and things like that wouldn't buy that. They would be too afraid. They had no idea price would react that way, but I'm leaning on this being a propulsion block.

*   This is a order block that's already confirmed that it is.
*   We broke through this candle's closure here, which is rejection Block.
    *   It's showing a willingness to want to go higher.
    *   I don't need this High to be taken.
    *   Now it's went above this one here while I'm bullish this down closed candle is a propulsion block.

So that range I'm shaded here I'm putting that and transposing that onto an hourly chart, so I'm watching price action on an hourly basis how it performs.

#### Multi-Monitor Setup and Timeframe Analysis

See, when I'm doing my live streams or if I'm doing a execution and I'm recording my trades, I don't have four laptops, folks, okay? I've had laptops, you know, numerous laptops over the years, and I kill them, I burn them out, and once they're done or close to being done, I take all the information off them, and they're dead, they're thrown away, there's nothing I can do with them. But I have many monitors in front of me on my system, and I've showed you that on my YouTube, I showed you my displays, I showed you what it looks like, and I'm watching different layouts, and one of the layouts I use has very similar to what you're seeing here where we have multiple time frames and I'm watching how price delivers on all of them. I'm not just staring at a one minute chart.

*   Can I trade with a one minute chart entirely all by itself? Yes.
*   But I'm not teaching you to do that because you're going to miss a lot of the information that I'm showing you here.

You would not have the context of using everything I'm talking about here without having the daily chart without having the weekly chart the draw on liquidity this blue line here.

#### Predicting vs. Reacting to Price Action

So, when I'm looking at Price whether I have it on the chart or if it's on my notepad because I'm using a notepad unless I draw it out on the chart for you because you're going to watch the video later on there's no there's no annotations on my chart because I want my focus on where we are in that range so on my notepad I have the high the low and the mean threshold price point of that Candlestick right there on the daily chart and I have on my notepad daily propulsion block hi mean threshold low so I'm watching price when it's Meandering around in here I'm watching time of day and how it responds at those specific levels because I'm predicting I'm anticipating I am *not* reacting to anything. The only time that I react is if I'm wrong and I see the evidence in price action that I'm offside or and likely to become offside then I'm going to react to that new information and say okay I got a bail on the trade that's the only permission that you're ever going to get from me to react to price because everything else we are absolutely predicting price you are doing that you're predicting the future that's what this is It's future it's why they call it Futures Trading your lip is in the name and why are you arguing saying you're not trying to predict the price or you shouldn't be trying to predict the price you are if you are bullish that means you are predicting higher prices if you're bearish You're Expecting and predicting lower prices how are you reacting to anything if you're reacting it means you're chasing price I'm not chasing price I'm waiting for very specific things where price will walk into my crosshairs and when it does it's going down I'm going to pull the trigger and I'm getting my entry I have 81 ways to get in there trust me I'm getting in there if trading was like a a cat burglar I'd be the best one at it because I can get in that.

#### Anticipating Market Movements and Liquidity

So we have the mean threshold here rallies back above relative equal highs have been cleared here and now the bodies are showing that there is an interest in seeing no further decline or how do I know that because the bodies are not closing inside that blue shaded area it's already done the work of doing what trading down into mean threshold one more time shifting higher so Market structure is now again one more time bullish so where's their inefficiency Above This price point right here when this candle closes this one right here when it closes where is the draw on liquidity from that price point there well you have this short term high so do you need do you need a depth of Market ladder to tell you or a or book map or some kind of order application to tell you there's going to be buy order stacking above this this High here do you need that because I don't you don't need that that's reading tape do you need to know that that all throughout this decline here while price starts going up you're going to see all the orders above the marketplace being eaten into because that's expected we expect that we anticipate that we're not reacting to that we're not surprised at saying wow look at how the depth of Market ladder is showing how all the orders keep getting eaten and consumed that that's expected that's reasonable we expect that we're not surprised to help we don't care what the number is either I don't care what the footprints sound how many people bought this level and versus that I don't care because my focus is on it's gonna roll right back up this inefficiency which is a sibi so I'll send a balanced by sound efficiency it's a classification of a fair value guy but then once it goes to this level here it's not done in my opinion because my focus is up here so I'm reading the tape I'm watching how it delivers all through here once you get to this price point here I'm going to anticipate I'm going to predict this is where I would be in my live stream this is where I would be in my recording of my execution I'd be typing out Big Range candles incoming when it gets right here right to that price point low right there I would be typing out we're going to anticipate we're going to expect we're predicting we're not going to be surprised by large up close candles why because it's going to make a quick run for the liquidity resting about this high that's what the algorithm does folks that's what it does you're not going to know that from the depth of Market you're not going to know that from the footprint because that's it doesn't have the ability to show you that experience reading price action does.

#### Tape Reading and Algorithmic Delivery

So tape reading is where that skill set is derived from watching price action how it behaves I don't count the number of buys and sells at a specific price level to me it's irrelevant information I don't care that doesn't doesn't mean anything to me that's like saying how many cars passed me on the left lane going to my destination this morning I don't know I'm focused on a destination which is up here I don't care how many cars pass me as long as I have air in my tires gas in my tank and my engine running fine I'm getting there that's my focus I'm looking through the windshield I'm not looking in a rear view mirror which is what footprint does depth of Market it's so short-term in perspective you don't need that it's it's built in the idea that if you know that you're trying to be long on a Marketplace it goes without saying that the orders above the marketplace should be eaten and eroded into so where's the advantage in that it goes without saying it's part of it if the Market's going to go higher well there you go I don't care how many people are actually buying it because the volume how many buying and selling has absolutely no bearing on my belief system and why price goes where it goes because it's algorithmically delivered that's the problem that all of you have with me you're all wrong and you're wrestling you're arm wrestling they saying no no this is what it really is but you're not even coming close to the results I'm showing you you can't even come close to the same Precision that I'm showing you you can't even call the Market to the degree I'm doing on a weekly basis now at some point at some point you have to sit down lay down your pitchforks and your torches and say you know what let me just listen to this guy and see where it takes me that's all I'm asking you to do you don't have to do it but everything I'm telling you happens I'm telling you what goes on the marketplace and why it does I'm literally teaching it to you I'm not demonstrating toys I'm teaching you how to do it what you have to do to develop this skill set it takes work it's not watching a video it's understanding what you're supposed to do and then go out and do it yourself and it's going to feel like you don't know what you're doing in the beginning but showing up every day and from the charts reading the tape that means studying how it behaves without putting a demo trade on without putting a live trade on without trying to pass a combine on a funded account it means simply studying what price does based on the time of day and day of the week knowing in advance which I tell you where the Market's going to go it's going to go up or it's going to go down to a very specific level not range not Zone and


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, formatted for clarity, readability, and retention of all details.

### Leveraging Experience and Market Structure in Trading

#### The Role of Experience in Market Analysis

"You use that **30 years experience** to trust while you're studying." This highlights the significance of experience in developing trust and intuition while analyzing market data.

#### Identifying and Interpreting ICT Bullish Breakers

"So we have an **ICT bullish breaker** here." This refers to a specific pattern or setup identified by the speaker using his methodology.

"These are the instances where you see classic support resistance ideas come in." This acknowledges the overlap between his concepts and traditional technical analysis.

*   "This right here this is one of those videos where someone's going to come back in the future and say see all ICT is doing he's showing you classic support and resistance and this is nothing new on Nissan no no trust me we're going to go deeper."
*   "I want you to think about why this level would be sensitive anyway because there's other highs to the left of this and I talk about that on my **market view** that I did yesterday."

Reference to a previous market review: "so on **July 15 2023** there's a market commentary or market review video and I talk about that very instance so I'm not going to take it any further than that because I've already talked about it yesterday."

#### Understanding Balanced Price Ranges

"But I want you to think about how the market from this high traded down and then traded up and then threw it what does that make this range from this low to that high once we broke out Above This High here which is what we were anticipating."

*   "We're not breakout Traders we're not reacting to price we want to see that but what makes this a very specific range this becomes a **balanced price range**."

Explanation of balanced price range: "what makes it balanced we had a high we traded it down so **sell side delivery** has been offered not sell side liquidity sell side delivery is any price run from a high to low we have had sell side delivery from here in here that that range now when we run right back over that entire range again from that low up to that high which is what we're doing here over time as soon as we break through here this High to that low is now a balanced price range."

Emphasis on directional expectation: "There is absolutely no reason to anticipate expect or want the seed price come back down below that low why because the focus is up here folks we're expecting we're predicting we're anticipating the market the footprint it's as radon up to that level we want to see that we're expecting that."

#### Identifying Market Milestones and Breakers

"So where is the mile markers that going to be where's the where's the rest stops along away well when the market runs above this area here it's more likely to do what treat this level here as a **breaker** or a springboard to go higher why because this High has a lower low that's higher than this low over here I'm not showing it to you because I want you to look at the commentary from yesterday I talk about this on the hourly chart."

Permissible deviations: "so the market comes back down does it Wick through that high absolutely and that's permissible that means it's allowed we expect that we anticipate that we're not reacting we're not scared by it either look where the bodies close right here and it opens right there."

#### Recognizing Inefficiencies and Breakaway Gaps

Reference to price inefficiencies: "so there are Wicks that are going down into this bison and balance I'll sound efficiency which is **busy** it's a fair value guy but what specifically stands out here what is that what's the segment between this high on that Candlestick right there to this candlesticks home what is this area what is that it's inefficient but then when we see this Candlestick here trade down into it it erodes some of this inefficiency so it starts from here to here this becomes a **breakaway Gap** we don't want to see that we don't want to see that filled in."

Confirmation of teaching strategy: "ah are you telling me the ICT is teaching how the sea anticipate and work with Breakaway gaps yes."

#### Addressing the Origin and Exploitation of Retail Trading Concepts

Disclaimer on originality: "now did I say ICT invented Breakaway gaps no when I first started learning how to look at Price action and uh **John Murphy's book** which is the retail Bible for Traders everything in that book if you knew how to really trade based on what I'm teaching you could turn it upside down if you see that pattern that's taught in that book and my concepts are called for the opposite that pattern in that book is going to fail."

*   "don't take my word for it and buy the book and challenge it so by the way I don't have any affiliation with John Murphy So when you buy his book I get new Kickback so there it is but it should be in every every Trader's library because it really is the retail Trader's Bible all that stuff in there is literally exploitable if you understand what price is really trying to do."

#### Predicting Market Movements vs. Reacting to Them

"So we have this area here is a break wake up the reason why it becomes a breakaway Gap and why we would never expect the depth of Market the **Dom** even if there was bigger orders below the marketplace here okay if there was a stacking of orders below that that were really large okay big big interest to draw into that area down there they're not going to go down there those things are not going to fill what yeah yep no Footprints are going to be found down below that that low right there because it's going to go higher because this area is going to stay open why should it stay open because it's running out of this range right here it's already done the work of digging into this **daily propulsion block**."

#### Importance of Multi-Timeframe Analysis

"This is why you cannot look at one Candlestick chart one time frame and follow the narrative you can't you can't be done folks either you're taking the information from the higher time frames and transposing them that means placing whatever ideas that you think is supportive or counterproductive for your trade from a higher time frame whatever makes that trade idea you're under the I guess expectation is going to pan out whatever those ideas are from a higher time frame weekly and daily chart they have to be on your tradable chart either in some kind of annotation some kind of you know line or you know some kind of you know mechanism that draws your attention to it because if you don't have this information if I didn't have the propulsion block shaded over here you would not know what it is I'm talking about down here what makes the context behind why it would be trading the way it is you wouldn't know that that's the only reason why I put this lipstick on the charts because you're learning from me so I don't need this but because I don't need it doesn't mean I shouldn't put on the chart because if you're learning it will help you it's a crutch it helps you stay organized from one time frame to the next but my focus is up here I want this to go higher so I'm gonna watch price reading the tape and look for all the evidences all the signatures and price action that support that very thing coming to pass I want to see periods where it's going to run aggressively higher if I get that then I'm gonna be really trustworthy that I'm on side that means I'm on the right side of the marketplace and stay with the idea."

#### Validating Trade Ideas and Questioning Conventional Tools

"Do we get that confirmation with the bodies thing at or above this high here yes does this stay open it's not trading back down into it so where's the advantage they are using depth of Market or ladders or footprint you would never expect this if you're my student you're never expecting this area to be printed into anymore but I promise you and I've seen it Traders are looking at those things and they're expecting to go down because they think this is an inefficiency now because ICC has talked about it no no this is why you should not be listening to **Dollar Menu mentorships** okay you're going through the ICT drive through just like they are okay you're having the same experience they are they're putting a price tag on something that they don't even know how to do yet learn how to do it independently you don't need to pay for this stuff."

#### Anticipating Market Liquidity and Reading the Tape

"So the market should be rallying higher where should It Go well where's the next draw on liquidity near term yes this is it up here but what Above This High exists in terms of liquidity buy sign so your book map or your depth of Market will start reflecting as we get closer to it there's going to be a lot of orders resting at or just above that high you need these tools to tell you that because I don't and my students don't need that either this is reading the tape this is what reading the tape is it has absolutely nothing to do with the things I opened this presentation up with so when you read or see or listen to these people out there they'll say you're talking about institutional order flow we're talking about reading the tape show me your order book no no no show me you using the information from those tools and you calling the market precisely because that is lacking I don't see that anywhere I absolutely do not see that I would love to see it I would be entertained by it and I would love watching the person whoever it may be that would be willing to do that I am a person that loves to study a traitor I don't want to relearn anything there's nothing else out there that would ever interest me that would ever be better than what might have what I have here is the market but I love watching how Traders navigate the marketplace themselves they manage themselves or mismanage themselves it's unfortunate sometimes but it's very entertaining also when they're discovering themselves and truth be told sometimes I try to counsel them and tell them where they should focus their attention on how to correct it and then many times it's not received in in good spirits I'm ridiculed or you know not given any regard for it but you know everybody has their own prerogatives in their own choices they don't have you don't have to you don't have to listen to me but I'm the guy calling all this stuff before it happens."

#### Analyzing Market Reactions and Gaps

"So the market right here has buy side the market draws up into it what happens before it gets to this run right here right here this run right there what happens you see this Wick right here you see that Wick half of that is what **consequent encroachment** interesting how it goes right down to it right there interesting how we have a gap right there with a wick so if we have a gap like this with a wick always trust and allow for it's likely to go into this consequent encroachment not just filled in that Gap right there so it can trade down even though it goes over top that Gap the the candlestick's hybrid here if it went through that live I would not be unsettled by that I would not be scared by that I would look for this candlesticks Wick right here the midpoint which is consequent encroachment we treat that as a gap the Mark goes right back to it there then what does it do right back up here all right so when the next game opens up I would be looking at that and saying okay now I want to see it start expanding towards this High here and I want to see it aggressively run through I want to see speed oh we get it there we come back down in what is it doing it's working inside this Wick which is what a gap we do gradients on wicks 75 of the wick 50 of the wick we never want to see in this case here lower than 50 or consequent equation which is half so in my mind when I'm watching price action over here I don't want to see it Go below half of that Wick find that in **Steve Nielsen's book** go over here look what it's doing it's going down but it won't breach on a closing basis midpoint of that Wick which is consequent encouragement that's tape reading you can't see that in Dom you can't see that in footprint you're not even going to look for it there's no reason for your look for it because it's not in that theory Dan's not talking about it white cup doesn't know anything about it either."

#### Observing Market Behavior and Expanding Towards Key Levels

"So the market does what it rallies Above This High here what's above that high buy side buy stops someone is chasing that lower when it's green this is an hourly chart so inside that week this in the hourly candlestick someone's going short where they're gonna place a stop about that high so the market does what it gravitates up to it here and we drop down respecting consequent encroachment there and we rally what do we do now we start expanding aggressively towards that **Weekly mitigation block** this level right here and we trade up into that level there and then we consolidate markets do not top like this."

#### Identifying Balanced Price Ranges and Setting Stop Losses

"So we have what is this what is this area right here become once we trade through it here right there what does this area or fractal and price action become the same thing I told you this becomes a **balanced price range** from this candlesticks High here up to this High then back down once we clear this High here this whole shaded area becomes a balanced price range I am not concerned about price one at any time up here going back down inside this range so for stop loss management your stop loss can be anywhere in this range and feel pretty confident that it's not going to get there so how would I do it and sleep good at night 75 of that range if my stop is below that I'm comfortable with that some of you get crazy about how I'm using my stops sometimes they get really close to what you might be scared to do at the time when you're watching my executions and you're seeing it you're thinking man this is crazy I wouldn't feel comfortable because you just don't know I'm teaching you right now these are long videos these are very dense very demanding of your attention to learn and that's expected I didn't tell you it's going to be easy and watch a video and you know how to do it I've warned you ahead of time it's going to take a lot of work but it's something that it's worth doing because once you have this skill set nobody can take it from you they can make jokes about all they want but they're never going to be able to do what you can do once you master this."

#### Analyzing Market Consolidations and Anticipating Movements

"So let's go into now we have the hourly chart over here and we have the balance price range there and now this chart here is a **15 minute time frame** so we have the market trading sideways ahead of Friday so we have this consolidation here and then we have a market report that's due out on Friday we're anticipating what the Market's not going to top like this so we anticipate the Market's going to do what spool higher going higher run higher so at **8 30** when the news comes out on Friday here's the **five minute chart** here we have the market rally aggressively here which is a **buy side and balanced sales sign efficiency** which is the long name for **bissy b-i-s-i** this is a fair value Gap by classification specifically buy side imbalance cell side inefficiency that means it's buy side imbalance it's more upside and it didn't go back and forth to offer sell side delivery we get partial sell side delivery with this drop right here in this segment in price action where I told you it's a breakaway Gap that's what I'm zoomed into here showing on a five minute basis."

#### Examining Market Dynamics and Identifying Liquidity Points

"But I want you to think about what is occurring here at this time of day at **10 30** after the news driver we have this swing low here and it breaks below that this segment of price action right in here is a fair value guy it's a **sibby sell side imbalance by side and efficiency** which is the opposite of this over here so it's offering the market on a sell side delivery but there is an inefficiency on buy side so we would anticipate markets like this to re-price up into this Candlestick or higher and then reprice lower why what time of day is it **New York lunch macro** so Above This High we have buy side liquidity and it's entering a time of day where the lunch macro which is going to do what it's going to run for liquidity where is the liquidity at for this time of day looking at in this area here it's below the lows of the morning what is that right here this is your your swing low right after the news driver hits the marketplace first swing low here everybody that went long or was long before this market report was out they have their cell stop resting right below that that's exactly what the lunch macro will do it'll run from this fairbag app here drop down aggressively leaving what most of this portion of this open which is what."


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, formatted for clarity, readability, and retention of all details.

### Applying ICT Concepts on Lower Timeframes: Breakaway Gaps, Breakers, and Order Flow

#### Connecting Breakaway Gaps and Breakers Across Timeframes

"I've already talked about in the couple minutes ago this is a **breakaway Gap** this line right here is this line right there it's the **breaker**."

*   "So this high that line is this line right here on the five minute chart this little segment of price action right there and it's a breakaway Gap that's this little portion right here below that low okay."

Explanation of Chart Navigation: "so that way you can find your way through the charts of what I'm showing you if you're not doing this with your own analysis and toggling through you know scrolling through each individual time frame while you're watching price action having every expectation the Market's going to be going what going higher."

*   Emphasis on directional bias: "so we're seeing even on the five minute chart look at the bodies of these candles here are they closing below that breaker line which is this candlesticks high right there even on the five minute chart it's showing you what that this is being respected there's no necessity for it to trade back down into this area so that will be a what a breakaway Gap that indicates that we're going to see continuous upside delivery and it's going to draw towards the buy side that's the next significant pool of liquidity."

#### Market Structure and Liquidity Targeting

"So throughout the afternoon we see the market treated higher come back down in trade higher come back down in some random fair value Gap here and then gravitate start moving towards the higher high again which is this here okay."

*   Limitations of Day Session: "we run out of day during the day session so all this consolidation when we resume at 6 PM because the market takes a an hour break between 5 PM Eastern Time to 6 p.m when that occurs when markets start trading again the same premise we would have in our expectation we're not reacting we're anticipating and predicting price that will eventually gravitate towards this High here."
*   Application Across Trading Sessions: "so if you're an overnight session Trader say you want to trade in Asia say you want to trade in London you're using these ideas in conjunction with the day and time that you're trading so where's liquidity the liquidity is not changing because you're trading in Asia the liquidity is not hiding itself and becoming something different and morphing into something else because you're in the London session liquidity is there and it's going to gravitate towards that level and if this context is here we focus on moving higher."

#### Analyzing overnight session and Identifying Key Price Action

"so let's go a little bit further in this here's that five minute chart you can see how we gravitated here higher and now the end of the day and now starting a new day so we start working towards what all throughout Asia and then we get to midnight interesting enough going into a new day at midnight New York time we ran the buy side here right there boom then we do what we come back down what's below here South Side stops."

#### Focusing on Specific Price Action Segments

"but I want to take you before we go any further here I want to take you back into this area here focus on this little segment of price action right there what time frame is this chart are you looking up here it's a five minute chart look at all the things here on this five minute chart do you see anything that stands out we'll come back to it but I want you to see in comparing contrast the price action on the five minute we're gonna drop down to a four three two and one but we're going to focus on this little area and why am I focusing on this area here to shade it in from this high down to that low and then how we start to deliver going back up because the the trust is that there's no necessity to go back down into this area which is a breakaway Gap because this line here is your bullish breaker everything is indicating that order flow is supporting that idea."

#### Dismissing the Need for Depth of Market Tools

"I don't need a ladder I don't need a depth of Market I don't need a footprint I don't need any of that stuff you don't either the time based chart will tell you everything you need it's simple it really is simple but you're trying to bring every concept that I've ever introduced into every discussion I'm not doing that I'm not bringing everything into this fractal here only things that stand out in this fractal I can only deal with whatever PD arrays exist in this shaded area so watch this shaded area this is the five minute chart now we're going to transition into a four minute okay notice any changes here."

*   Call to Action for Independent Study: "this is the part of the video you're going to want to go back and study independently or look at it from your own chart preferably I don't know what time you're going to watch this video maybe years later but I'm doing this for the purpose of that because you may not be able to recall this information on your chart at the time so yeah you can use my charts here and screenshot them and do whatever annotations you want to do."

#### Multi-Timeframe Analysis: 3-Minute to 1-Minute Charts

"now we'll look at the three minute chart okay that is all this here what is price dealing I don't need a depth of Market to show you what I'm about to show you it's a two minute chart same range but it looks different doesn't it and then finally down to the one minute chart."

#### Identifying Bullish Order Blocks on the 1-Minute Chart

"now this green line here again is the **hourly bullish breaker** that high we dig into it here one one two three times and then we have a swing High broken to the upside the last down closed candle prior to that shift in Market structure that down close candle is a **bullish order block** that opening price is a change in the state of delivery now huge leap forward for people that want to learn order blocks okay for the record order blocks have zero notice I'm not talking about that the market here notice I'm not even pointing at a ladder I'm not talking about footprint I didn't even talk about volume I don't care how many orders were purchased or sold short in this candle it's irrelevant that has nothing to do with my order block my order block which is codified and created and authored by me nobody else is the author of it I didn't borrow it from somebody else and any supply and demand this candle right here the open of that candle the change in the state of delivery is when that candle sticks opening price is crossed right there for the first time when that happens then and only then never before never another time in the future that validates this down closed candle as a bullish order block now why what makes that an order block the fact that we have this bullish hourly breaker the fact that we traded down into it and then we see a shift in Market structure then we go back to the down closed candle the last one prior to a run higher that has a shift in Market structure there that is not a change of character rebranding stop it this is not an Fu candle this is not an engulfing King I don't care if this candle started here it opened here and went down or if it opened here and went down I would draw it right on the opening price it has nothing to do with engulfing it has nothing to do with anything else except for what I'm teaching you right here folks anybody out there trying to teach order blocks unless they're parenting exactly what I said in another video lecture they don't know what they're talking about period and the story that's just the facts this becomes a bullish order block as soon as that candle crosses it what the opening price that's the change in the state of delivery soon as that occurs this low should not be violated so you can now start looking for bullish PD arrays that are in discount well everything's in a discount now because we're so far down but we have a down close candle right here so we can use that opening price extend it for anything in there buying this anywhere in this area here buying buying that you can buy that with a stop loss right below there well that's a little bit too wide for me then don't take the tree wait for another run higher and look for an inefficiency wait for a fair value go wait for a breaker wait for a institutional order for entry drill wait for whatever your model is suggesting you should use but look closer we are now looking at that price range from this high up here all the way down to that low we trusted that low will not be violated why because this Candlestick was crossed right there now what happens let's pay Depot's Advocate what happens if it breaks that low okay then you have this continuously study price action and wait for that same instances where we see a shift in our construction to it upside in the last down closed candle we'll mark the opening price and if there's a candle that goes above it that validates the down close candle as a bullish order block this is only one form of my bullish over block there are so many of them and yes for the folks out there that have a problem with me having all kinds of weapons in my repertoire I'm sorry that I'm not a one-trick pony I'm sorry that there's a whole lot of things out there but you don't have to know everything I'm teaching you you just need one thing one thing one concept one model and you can be profitable and you don't have to worry about anything else I've ever made videos about I don't know why you guys are complicated you're complicating it not me you are."

#### Risk Management and Gradients

"so we have the ranges here 75 of the range is the gradient 50 percent and then 25 percent so I want you to notice how as price works very close to 25 of that range again the range is the high to that low we are trusting that it wants to go higher now because we have a change in a state of delivery and when that candle starts moving above that opening price now we have it it's in place we have a shift in Market structure all lights are green for going higher."

#### Tape Reading and Institutional Order Flow

"how do we use this information how do we read the tape how do we discount the necessity for reaching for depth of Market ladders and footprints you'll need those tools look at price order flow what kind of order flow institutional order flow easiest right to the chase no bones about it easiest thing is if we're bullish we want to see down closed candles support price if we see a short-term low taken out we expect to see that as a stop run and then price should revert right back into going higher right away and everything I just said reverse it for when the markets are bearish it's that simple folks."

#### Observing Market Behavior and Order Block Confirmation

"watch we have a down closed candle here draw it out in time does price support at that level yes yes yes does it start moving higher yes does it take out short-term highs yes yes down close candle is price supporting it as a bullish order block yes it's not going below it does price go higher and take out High yes it does we have a down closed candle does price go down into it and reject that area and leave it and break a high yes do you need a depth of Market ladder to tell you that we expect the depth of Market the latter to start eating into those orders above the market price that's expected folks we anticipate that we are predicting that to happen we expect that your candlesticks and your raincoat bars and your algo bars and whatever the hell you're going to be using they're going to start going higher that's expected folks we expect that we're not surprised by it down close candles here why am I picking this one because it's above this High here and it's high here so does it support price look at it what happens when it hits it starts going higher does it take out a short-term High yes it does so is order flow bullish or bearish if what is it reaching for a premium relative to what the range which is this High to that low that is determined by this level here which is equilibrium at that level or below it is what discount at that level or above is what premium so when we get above this 50 level it's far less probability more risk if we start taking order blocks and buying them Above This level because we're in the premium range of this high to low doesn't mean it can't keep rallying it just means that we have to do all of our buying below equilibrium or less while we're on a discount that's the framework for high probability short-term lows being taken out we expect that to be rejected and start seeing price go higher we start to see it run higher here because it finds support on this down closed candle here yes sends it higher does it take a short term High yes and yes we have a down closed candle here right around equilibrium no return back to here that's fine because that we're in an area where it's a short-term premium down closed candle here look at the body supporting that idea and then the Rally's higher Highs are taken out down closed candle does it support it as bullish yes higher so when I'm watching price and I'm on one side and I'm expecting prices to go higher I'm looking at every down closed candle as a means or mechanism to support price or any swing low is a potential stop run so I'm not in a hurry if I'm long to ram my stop loss between some random swing low because that's exactly what the algorithm is going to do it's going to sweep below them like it does here like it does here and like it does here and then once it does that a round equilibrium then it's going to go into another price leg higher and then we enter a consolidation what's below here cell stops now we can go higher notice also that we have all of these fair value gaps right here and all this in here when we have a change in the state of delivery and we enter a buy program which is where we are from this point on there."

#### Analyzing retracements and Imbalances

"well what's going on here Michael it's just retracing that's all it's doing it's allowing for a Deeper Discount with that low staying intact when this high is taken out here notice that we have another return back into this order block when we have this retracement back in the over block here that's when we start seeing the more pronounced run higher but look what's occurring here all of this imbalance here what is it lacking buy side delivery not liquidity buy side deliveries when there is a run higher in Price look what it's doing it runs higher look at the bodies respecting what the inefficiency is high right there this city that candle is low wasn't respecting this candle's low here now what is it dropping down into consequent encroachment midpoint of this candle's low and this candle is high there rallies where's rally two the fair Bay Gap right here so what how we use this information their inversion fair value gaps these are like a mountain climber and the mountain climber is climbing up the surface of the mountain and he's looking for those little pockets that stick his fingers into and stick his toes on to find footing and grasp a new finger point or holding point to pull his body up well we're in a bullish market now we're in a buy program we're climbing a mountain what's the mountain this is the Mountainside here this is the most sheer drop-off so this is the smoothest part in that drop-off so we have to use these areas to find what footing there's little pockets we have to wait for them to form that means consequent encroachment short term low trades below what's it going to do trade back into this order block and take out that short-term low for sell stops I'm not freaking out when I see that I want to see it react at that order block and then also that it's taken out liquidity and there's also a volume and balance right there that's tape reading you watch price whether you're watching it live or you have to watch it in Market replay which is not going to be the same folks unless unless you can watch price delivery every individual fluctuation which trading view is limited it doesn't do that um it's better for you if you can't watch live price action to to Res you know record your screens I use Camtasia which is a application from techsmith.com t-e-c-h-s-m-i-t-h Dot c-o-m and that is the the program that I use to record and make these videos you can set it to record the marketplace while you're at work while you're sleeping while you're at school whatever and then when you come home you can play back the recording and watch real-time price."

Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, formatted for clarity, readability, and retention of all details.

### Measuring Gaps and Breakaway Gaps: Understanding Market Dynamics

#### Identifying Measuring Gaps

*   Definition: A **measuring gap** is formed between a high and a low, where a price run is expected to occur approximately halfway.
*   Expectation: After the gap forms and price moves away, it's **not** expected to return into that gap.
*   Skill Requirement: Identifying where the market is likely to draw is essential for consistent classification of measuring gaps.
*   Example: When the market is running higher and there's a gap that forms, it moves up and away, you are not expecting to come back into that.

#### Understanding Breakaway Gaps

*   Definition: **Breakaway gaps** signify an energetic price run moving away from an area anticipated beforehand.
*   Anticipation: Requires expecting a price move (e.g., lower) before it actually happens.
*   Formation: When the expected move occurs, creating a gap, it's identified as a breakaway gap.
*   Context: Often observed after consolidation or experiencing time distortion.
*    Example: After the market is anticipating to move lower, when it finally does and it creates a gap like this, it should be looked at as a breakaway gap.

### Time Distortion, Order Flow, and Institutional Order Flow

#### Defining Time Distortion

*   Simple Explanation: Time distortion refers to the time between segments of the day when markets begin to spool.
*   Understanding: Initial comprehension may take time, but repeated exposure through lessons will clarify its meaning.
*   Example: The market rips below the sell-side liquidity multiple times and then consolidates at the close going into 20 percent of the range of nasdaq's weekly candle.

#### Emphasizing Tape Reading and Anticipation

*   Scope: Covers reading the tape, macros, time of day, breakaway gaps, measuring gaps, and anticipating price action.
*   Tools to Avoid: Discourages reliance on ladders, depth of market, footprint, or similar tools.
*   Focus: Emphasis is placed on anticipating price performing a specific function.
*    Focus on institutional order flow.

#### The Significance of Order Flow

*   Type: Specifically refers to **institutional order flow**.
*   Basis: Grounded in the concepts and patterns being taught.
*   Context: Price is the key context and focus of analysis.
*   Institutional order flow is going to be based on the things I'm showing you here.

### Avoiding Overcomplicated Analysis

#### Simplifying Market Understanding

*   Alternative Analysis: Rather than overanalyzing open, high, low, and close data with mathematical indicators.
*   Mathematical indicators vs past experience: Better to analyze past experience.
*   Alternative Analysis: Rather than crunching numbers, look at the past and say "this is how many contracts were bought or sold at this price, and therefore I believe this or that".
*   Depth of Market Caution: Do not determine what price is going to do depending on a larger range of numbers/orders above or below marketplace price.
*   Pitfalls: Using open, high, low, and close data can be overly complicated and not indicative of market behavior.

#### The Depth of Market Misconception

*   Potential Trap: Believing that a larger number of orders above the market price indicates an intention for the price to move higher.
*   Scenario: Example of being in a situation where the market is about to move lower, but the depth of market suggests many orders just above the price.
*   Smart Money: Those orders might simply represent a large pool of smart money's stop-loss orders that won't be triggered.
*   Result: Price runs away, surprising those who relied solely on the depth of market.
*   Believing market will eat into those orders is a misconception because that might be just a large pool of smart monies stop loss that isn't going to be eroded.

#### Debunking Misconceptions

*   Source of Misconceptions: "All these things come out of the mouths of people that just don't know how to do this yet."
*   Objective: To help learners understand how to capture price runs without hurting themselves.
*   Hope: Is to find this one insightful and edifying for you until I'll talk to you next time be safe.

# Market Analysis and Trading Strategies: July 18, 2023

This document provides a detailed breakdown of a market analysis video, focusing on specific trading strategies and perspectives shared on July 18, 2023. It covers various aspects of market behavior, including dollar indexes, S&P 500 (ES), and NASDAQ, with an emphasis on avoiding common pitfalls and adapting to market dynamics.

## I. Dollar Index Analysis

*   **Current State:** The dollar index is currently meandering within a gap between two weekly reference points. The preference is for it to trade down a little further.
*   **Reference Video:** Review the YouTube video from **July 9th, 2023**, for a market review.
    *   Prior to this date, the expectation was for the market to open on a new week, trade down using the inversion fair value gap from the weekly chart.
*   **Outcome:** The market opened, traded down, rallied, and completed the weekly volume imbalance.
    *   This is considered an "absolute slam dunk."
*   **Key Takeaway:** Wait for powerful moves and understand what you are looking for, avoiding the urge to anticipate retracements.

## II. S&P 500 (ES) Analysis

### Weekly Chart Review

*   **Original Volume Imbalance:** The analysis focused on the original weekly volume imbalance.
*   **Current Status:** The market has traded to and through the volume imbalance.
*   **Looking Ahead:** The focus is now on another volume imbalance.

### Comparison with NASDAQ

*   **NASDAQ's Leadership:** NASDAQ is considered the leadership index, outperforming ES.
*   **Volume Imbalances:** NASDAQ has already completed both weekly volume imbalances, while ES is lagging.
*   **ES as the "Sixth Sister":** ES has been lagging behind other averages.

### Key Levels and Patterns

*   **Fair Value Gap & Breaker:** A fair value gap, breaker, bull shoulder block, and propulsion block are present.
*   **Volume Imbalance Zones:** Identify high and low points of weekly volume imbalances as potential support and resistance.

### Settlement Price

*   **Settlement Price Usage:** The settlement price toggle is used when looking for closing points in reference to TGIF trades.
*   **Flexibility:** The approach is flexible, considering both imbalances and settlement prices for potential trading opportunities.

### Daily Chart Analysis

*   **Current Trading Day:** Refers to the trading activity of Monday and Tuesday.
*   **Fair Value Gap:** The market was reacting to a fair value gap.
*   **Avoid Picking Tops in Buy Programs:** The central strategy is to never try to pick tops in buy programs (or bottoms in sell programs).
    *   Allow the market to "color outside the lines" instead of assuming retracements.
    *   "When the market is wanting to go higher, you have to submit to that, or don't trade."

### Lower Time Frame Analysis (18th July, 2023)

*   **Initial Move:** Small consolidation, drop to take out sell-side liquidity, then a rapid acceleration.
*   **Target:** Trading up into the higher weekly volume imbalance.

### Five-Minute Chart

*   **Opportunities:** Many entry opportunities were present.
*   **Key Patterns:** 15-minute order blocks and fair value gaps.
*   **Homework:** Review the 15-minute time frame to identify patterns on the "Bellwether" chart.

## III. NASDAQ Analysis

*   **Relative Equal Highs:** Previously, the analysis mentioned the likelihood of breaking through relative equal highs (which it did).
*   **Continuation:** The market is continuing to trade through last week's high.
*   **Mindset:** Avoid trying to pick tops in a rising market.
*   **Trade with Order Flow:** Trade in the direction of the market's momentum, avoiding attempts to capture reversals.

### Daily Chart

*   **Order Block and Propulsion Block:** An order block and repulsion block are identified.
    *   Crucially, the price did not close below the middle (mean threshold) of the propulsion block.

### Tuesday's Trading

*   **Institutional Order Entry:** A small institutional order entry occurred.
*   **Continuation:** Continued upside movement with "wonderful" trading opportunities.
*   **Trading Through Candles:** The market opened and traded down through candles, indicating that areas aren't being respected as supply.

### Discount Array & Month Four Content

*   **Discount Array:** The revisited low is seen as a discount array.
*   **Reference Material:** Refer to the month four content (premium mentorship), specifically the PD Array Matrix lectures on YouTube.
*   **Expectation:** In a bullish scenario, anticipate price to trade higher from this discount array.

### Hourly Chart

*   **Retail Trap:** A small consolidation is present, which might be seen as a bull flag by retail traders.
*   **Twitter Reference:** A tweet from the same day outlines the bias and strategy.
*   **Explosive Move:** A nice explosive price move higher occurred, clearing the 16,000 level.

### Five-Minute Chart Breakdown

*   **Low Formation:** A low formed shortly after the 9:30 opening.
*   **Fair Value Gaps & Order Blocks:** Fair value gaps and order blocks presented high-probability rally opportunities.
*   **High of Day:** The high of the day was reached in the last hour of trading, followed by a trade-off from the highs back into an order block.

## IV. Trading Philosophy & Mindset

### Avoiding Top Picking (Reiterated)

*   **Buy Programs:** Emphasized the importance of not trying to pick tops in buy programs.
*   **Algorithmic Price Delivery:** A buy program occurs when the market is under an algorithmic price delivery or price run that's repricing higher.
    *   This is distinguished from a traditional bull market or trend.
*   **Dismissing Traditional Indicators:** After understanding market manipulation, traditional trading indicators were dismissed.

### Key Tweet Analysis

*   **Waiting for Retail Sales Data:** Looking to see if retail sales data (released at 8:30 AM New York time) would cause a drop and subsequent rally.
*   **Desired Movement:** Movement, regardless of direction, is key.

### 9:30 Delivery Analysis

*   **Rejection of Bull Flag Narrative:** Not counseling viewers to see the initial consolidation as a bull flag.
*   **Trap Setup:** The market drops at 9:30, creating a Judah Swing and trapping traders expecting continuation patterns.
*   **Respect for PD Arrays:** Focus on whether the market respects the defined PD Arrays and discount arrays, indicating potential long opportunities.

## V. New Gift to the Trading Community: ICT Reaper Inversion Fair Value Gap

*   **Breaker Context:** Run higher, break lower, trade above it, come back down and that should be a bullish breaker.
*   **Three Drives Pattern Counterpoint:** A "low, high, lower low" pattern might resemble a three drives pattern, but it should not be viewed as a topping pattern.

### Codified Algorithm Logic

*   **Continuation Opportunities:** If there is an opportunity for the market to continue higher (or lower, reversed), the focus shifts.
*   **Price Level Target:** A specific price level (16,028.75) is targeted.
    *   Targeted point was one handle above 1 Standard Deviation (Dev)

### ICT Reaper Inversion Fair Value Gap Explanation

*   **Reaper Definition:** Inside a breaker, you're going to cut through candles because areas are not being respected as supply.
*   **Differentiation:** This method is distinct from standard supply and demand or liquidity void strategies.

### Mechanism and Logic

*   **Price Run & Fair Value Gap:** Price run leaves a fair value gap in the lower portion of the price run.
*   **Discount Requirement:** The fair value gap must be in a discount relative to the low-to-high range of the price run.
*   **Stop Run:** The market trades down through the fair value gap, running stops to eliminate traders with trailing stop losses.
*   **Breaker Trap:** Traders attempting to use the breaker pattern are also punished.
*   **Rationale:** By identifying and capitalizing on the shifted sentiment, the trader goes "under the radar."


# Further Elaboration on Trading Strategies and Market Analysis

## I. Morning Market Analysis (July 18, 2023): ICT Reaper Inversion Fair Value Gap

*   **Time Context:** As of 7:43 AM New York local time.
*   **Anticipated Market Movement:** The expectation was for the market to drop down into Monday's range.
*   **Monday's Range:** Reference points are midnight on Monday and Monday's high, New York local time.
*   **Ideal Long Entry:**
    *   Optimal entry point for going long is at equilibrium or higher.
    *   *Exception:* When an **ICT Reaper** is present in price action.
*   **Observed Market Action:** The market dropped, then rapidly moved upwards.
*   **Signature Confirmation:** The observed signature confirmed the setup.

### Candlestick Highs and Lows Reference

*   **Algorithm Logic:** The algorithm references candlestick highs and lows to determine previously unknown support and resistance levels.
*   **Classic Support and Resistance:** Classic support and resistance is only validated with a **Fair Value Gap**.
*   **Reaper Confluence:** The **Consequent Encroachment** of the Reaper enhances validation.

### Reaper Definition and Context

*   **Codified Definition:** A Reaper is a **Fair Value Gap** in the discount of an impulsive price leg of a bullish breaker.
*   **Bearish Counterpart:**
    *   A bearish **ICT Reaper Inversion Fair Value Gap** would be a bearish breaker.
    *   It would feature a **Fair Value Gap** on the premium side of the impulsive price leg.
*   **Reversibility:** These concepts are fully reversible.
*   **Contextual Bias:** A bias and a prevailing retail narrative are necessary.
    *   In this instance, a bull flag pattern was identified.
*   **Price Action Observation:** The market drops into the previous day's range.
*   **50% Range Respect:** Bodies of candlesticks respect 50% of the previous day's range.
*   **Wicks' Role:** Wicks inflict the damage, particularly by the Reaper.
*   **Entry Trigger:** A signature confirms that the pattern is complete, signaling a move higher, triggering a long entry.

## II. Trade Execution and Management

*   **Complexity Note:** This strategy may be a little beyond the scope for some, but additional details will be included in an upcoming book.
*   **Standard Inversion Fair Value Gap:** A standard inversion fair value gap is present within a classic bullish breaker.
*   **Price Leg:** Price movement occurred between the low of the handle and the high of the candle.
*   **Entry Details:**
    *   Six contracts were entered long at 15781.
    *   Entry was below and inside the inversion Fair Value Gap, specifically at the candle that qualified and confirmed the Reaper.
*   **Exit Strategy:** A market exit was executed rather than setting a stop loss.
    *   The decision was driven by the need for mobility and inability to actively manage the trade via mobile device.
*   **Exit Result:** The trade was closed a little bit above the 16,000 level.
*   **Profitability:** The trade yielded over 120 handles on NASDAQ (approximately $14,000+).

## III. One-Minute Chart Analysis

*   **Initial Runoff:** An initial runoff occurred, and entry was made as the candle was dropping down.
*   **Classic Return:** A classic return into a Fair Value Gap bullish breaker was observed.
*   **Secondary Entry:** A secondary entry opportunity was presented near the gift of that one.
*   **Manual Closure:** The trade was manually closed.

## IV. Capturing Big Runs: Higher Timeframe Perspective

*   **Objective:** To capture large market movements, not just small gains.
*   **Initial Consolidation:** The initial consolidation might resemble a bull flag, tempting traders to buy.
*   **Silver Bullet Entry:** The entry described is a silver bullet with extra contextual factors
    *   The strategy is essentially a silver bullet "on steroids".
*   **Lunchtime Macro:** The market starts running higher around lunchtime.
*   **Avoiding Top Picking:** Reinforces the concept of not attempting to pick tops in buy programs.
*   **Daily Range Expectation:** Expectation for the daily range to create an extreme high if the market is bullish in the PM session, especially in the last hour.
*   **Time of High Formation:** The high was formed around 3:00 PM.
*   **Trade-Off Acceptance:** Accept that not every handle will be captured (e.g., giving up about a hundred handles).
*   **Profit Target Flexibility:** 120 handles is considered sufficient.
*   **Risk Management:** Place a stop loss upon entry and avoid constantly adjusting or trailing it.
*   **Trust the Algorithm:** Trust the codified algorithm and the expected price delivery.

*   **Silver Bullet Time:** Time window for trading a silver bullet is 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM.
*   **Additional Entry:** A displacement down and closed candle created another potential entry point for four more contracts.
*   **Standard Model:** Describes the standard model for trading index futures.

# Market Review: Dollar Index, Euro Dollar, S&P & NASDAQ Futures

This analysis covers the **Dollar Index, Euro Dollar, S&P 500,** and **NASDAQ** futures, providing insights into potential market movements based on weekly and daily charts.

## Dollar Index Analysis

### Weekly Chart

*   Observed **discount** last week, but price fell one pipette short of the actual weekly candle's low.
*   Currently moving towards a **sell-side imbalance buy-side inefficiency (SIBI)**.
*   Two key price points to watch:
    *   **Consequent encroachment (50% level) of the wick of the current weekly candle**
    *   **Midpoint (50% level) of the low of the current weekly candle.**
    *   Monitor price action at these levels for potential trading opportunities.

### Daily Chart

*   Price nearly reached a specific level but didn't quite make it.
*   Current rally into an **efficiency** area.
*   A small gap exists, representing a **liquidity void** where no actual trading occurred between two adjacent candles.
*   Monitoring whether price will retrace into this gap.
*   If the gap remains open and price begins to move lower, it could persist for an extended period.

## Euro Dollar Analysis

### Weekly Chart

*   Focus on the **weekly volume imbalance**.
    *   Defined as the difference between a candle's closing and opening price.
    *   Important to note that while the candlestick wick and tail overlapped, there's no **Candlestick body** between those price points.
    *   Markets’s unwillingness to create a body between two respective candlesticks is a **Volume imbalance**.
*   Algorithm will likely refer to this weekly inefficiency.
*   The draw on liquidity sought for months has been delivered.
*   **High of the week**: Price traded up to the high of the weekly volume imbalance.
*   **Low of the week**: Price traded down to the low end of the volume imbalance, with the close near the low.

### Daily Chart

*   Delivery occurred, painting back over the range from the low to the high of the weekly volume imbalance, then back down again.
*   Targets from the **July 9th analysis video (available on YouTube)** were met.
*   The move back down into the **weekly inversion gap** and the draw to buy-side liquidity, followed by the move up into the **weekly volume imbalance**, completes a demonstration of the concepts.
*   **Key takeaway:** Focus now shifts to the *next* potential move, but don't force it.
*   Price could move:
    *   Higher, trading into the **fair value gap (FVG)**.
    *   Lower, digging deeper into the **buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency (BISI)** or **sell-side imbalance buy-side inefficiency (SIBI)**.
*   Due to the 50/50 likelihood of either direction, shift focus to **intraday trading** (London Open and New York Open sessions).

### Hourly Chart

*   Price traded through buy-side liquidity, found support at the low end of the weekly volume imbalance, then traded to the high before aggressively returning to the low.
*   **Upside interests:** Inefficiencies and discount areas are two areas of interest for me.
*   Avoid overzealous predictions until **Sunday's opening price** is known.
*   It's acceptable *not* to know the next move, submitting to the uncertainty of the market. Allow the market to provide insights as the new week opens.

## S&P and NASDAQ Futures

### Weekly Chart

*   S&P 500 (left), NASDAQ mini futures (right).
*   The previously mentioned inefficiencies were targeted last week.
*   NASDAQ reached the outlined **weekly fair value gap (FVG)**.
*   While not predicting a top, it's reasonable to expect a pullback into the inefficiencies for both markets.
*   To suggest an intermediate-term high:
    *   **S&P 500:** Price must close *below* the low of the down-closed candle on a weekly basis.
    *   **NASDAQ:** Price must close *below* the low of the down-closed candle on a weekly basis.
*   If these conditions are met, focus will shift to lower timeframe sell setups until the market indicates a return to bullishness.
*   **Current status:** Both markets remain bullish, with no current signs of a top.

### Daily Chart: S&P 500

*   Immediate rebalance identified between a candle and the next down-closed candle.
*   Price opened and traded up to the previous closed candle before rejecting.
*   Unless Friday's high is breached, a pullback into the unclosed inefficiency is likely.
*   Such a pullback would remain bullish long-term.
*   Stop losses likely trail below a swing low.
*   Inefficiency exists between a candle's high and another's low.
*   Potential scenarios include:
    *   Trading down to the midpoint of the lower inefficiency on the weekly chart.
    *   A quick trade below the low close.
    *   A move down to the consequent encroachment (50% level) from the wick.
*   Maintain the breakaway gap.
*   All scenarios are negated if price closes above Friday's high.

### Daily Chart: NASDAQ

*   Fair value gap (FVG) is almost entirely closed in.
*   Anticipating a move down into the order block.
*   Potential scenario: a gap down, trade up to fill the gap, and then move lower into the order block or the mean threshold.
*   Many scenarios are possible before Sunday's opening.

### General Strategy

*   Due to market uncertainty, shift focus to lower timeframes and intraday trading.
*   Seek inefficiencies and/or buy-side/sell-side liquidity for draws on liquidity.
*   Maintain a neutral bias intraday.

## E-Mini S&P: 15-Minute Time Frame

*   Rallied up on Sunday and Monday of the previous week, then came straight back down with aggressive rally higher.
*   Traded up into that higher inefficiency on the weekly chart (weekly volume imbalances).
*   Price worked lower, traded back up into a **balanced price range**.
    *   Defined by a **buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency (BISI)** and a **sell-side imbalance buy-side inefficiency (SIBI)**.
*   Rejection occurred within this balanced price range.
*   Anticipating sell-side liquidity to be targeted:
    *   Sell-side liquidity below recent lows.
*   Likely a run into that sell-side in the first part of the week.
*   Reminding that we have not opened for the new week yet.
*   Unless price gets above this High, probing for lower sell-side liquidity pool is likely.

## NASDAQ E-Mini Futures: 15-Minute Time Frame

*   Favor a move below a specific low, targeting a small inefficiency.
*   Looks "heavy" as long as price doesn't trade above a specific high.
*   Continuation lower is the primary interest.
*   Price went into a short-term premium to get into fair value gap (FVG) and breaker.
*   Seeking a gap lower, attempt to fill the gap, and reach into that area.
*   This scenario is for observing, not necessarily for trading.

## Trading Approach for the Week

*   **Hold Trading:** No trading planned until Tuesday.
*   Use **Monday's trading** to establish a better foundation for the weekly candlestick bias.
*   **Intraday Only:** Focus will be exclusively on intraday trading this week.
*   Seek intraday volatility, targeting buy-side or sell-side liquidity and/or inefficiencies.
*   Avoid forcing trades and allow the next setup to come.

**Reminder:** This analysis is a review and counseling, emphasizing a slow and deliberate approach to the upcoming trading week, allowing Monday's price action to provide the bias for the week.

## Comprehensive Guide to Journaling for Trading Success

**Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQqwmDJOtxk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQqwmDJOtxk)

This guide outlines the crucial importance of journaling in trading, particularly for new or struggling traders. It emphasizes that consistent profitability is achieved through dedicated study and detailed journaling, **NOT** by rushing into live trading.

### I. The Foundation: Why Journaling is Essential

*   **Consistency & Model Identification:** All profitable traders have a consistent model, developed through dedicated journaling.
*   **Avoiding Rushing:** Don't prioritize real profits before mastering the fundamentals. Spend time with journaling before demo or paper trading.
*   **The Core Problem:** Lack of consistency often stems from insufficient journaling and failure to personalize the learning experience.
*   **Beware of Information Overload:** Watching a few videos or focusing on single aspects (e.g., fair value gaps, order blocks) isn't enough. Price action requires a holistic understanding.
*   **The Real Learning Source:** True understanding comes from personal chart analysis and journaling. **Not** solely from watching videos or live trading examples.

### II. Addressing Common Objections & Misconceptions

*   **"I've heard this before" or "I don't have time":** Many dismiss journaling, prioritizing immediate profits and trade setups.
*   **The Consequence:** These traders often complain about struggling to find their model, understand price action, or predict market movements.
*   **Immediate Reactionary Mindset:** Reacting to immediate outcomes without studying underlying mechanisms.
*   **Backtesting Misconceptions:** Backtesting is **NOT** just about taking trades or using market replay reports to look at numbers.
*   **Understanding the "Why":** It's about understanding **WHY** specific price action should deliver in a certain way.
    *   Identifying repeatable procedures and protocols.
    *   Understanding the logic behind market movements (e.g., why it moves to a discount from a premium).

### III. The Secret Recipe: Time & Focused Chart Study

*   **The Key Ingredient:** The amount of time spent genuinely studying charts, NOT just aimlessly gazing.
*   **Decoding Price Action:** If candlesticks feel like a foreign language, it's due to insufficient journaling.
*   **The Constant Effort:** Consistent and precise trading requires continuous journaling.

### IV. Journaling Methods & Ethical Considerations

*   **Variety of Approaches:** There are many ways to record journal experiences.
*   **App Recommendations:** There are good apps for journaling, but no specific app recommendations will be provided.
*   **Maintaining Objectivity:** No affiliations or Kickbacks are taken from any company or service that is mentioned. The priority is trust and honesty.
*   **Avoiding Bias:** Advertising or affiliate marketing is avoided to maintain unbiased opinions.

### V. Trust and the Value of True Understanding

*   **Building Trust:** Information is only shared if there is personal usage and belief in it to maintain trust with the audience.
*   **True Understanding:** The most important thing is building trust in understanding what order flow is.
*   **Order Flow Decoded:** Everything needed is in the candlesticks:
    *   Inefficiencies.
    *   Liquidity above and below.
    *   Time of day.
    *   Day of the week.
*   **No Indicators Required:** No indicators or gimmicks are needed.

### VI. Practical Example: Analyzing the NASDAQ (NQ)

*   **Market Example:** The NASDAQ continuous chart is used as an example.
*   **TradingView Symbol:** Use `NQ1!` on TradingView.
*   **Timeframe:** Start with the one-month timeframe.
*   **Preparation:** The annotations in the following example took hours to prepare.
*   **Key Steps:**
    *   Log annotations.
    *   Make higher timeframe PD arrays visible on lower timeframes.
    *   Work with them on a daily basis.
    *   Review on weekends.
*   **Pertinent PD Arrays:** Can be used on lower timeframes (15-minute, 5-minute, 1-minute, or even less).
*   **Applicability:** The same principles apply to:
    *   Euro/Dollar
    *   Dollar Index
    *   E-mini S&P
    *   Commodities
    *   Any Market

### VII. Top-Down Approach & PD Array Matrix

*   **Methodology:** Focus on how the higher timeframe influences the lower timeframe.
*   **Monthly Chart Analysis:** Pause the video and identify key observations in recent months.

### VIII. Example Journaling Process: Annotating the Monthly Chart

*   **Journaling Style:** Bring your unique personality into your journaling.
*   **Self-Love:** Include comments that demonstrate confidence and foresight.
*   **Brain Conditioning:** "Trick" your brain by recording pseudo-experiences to improve future recognition.
*   **Weekend Review:** Refer back to journal entries on weekends.
*   **PD Array Recognition:** Focus on recognizing PD arrays (e.g., fair value gaps, breakers).
*   **Breaker Identification:** Even on higher timeframes, breakers can be identified with clarity on lower timeframes.
*   **Breakers as Mitigation Blocks:** Breakers are essentially mitigation blocks.

### IX. Key Definitions

*   **Monthly Bearish Breaker High/Low:** The high/low of the down-closed candle that acts as a breaker.
*   **Fair Value Gap (FVG):** An area where price is imbalanced, often forming as a buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency (down candle) or a sell-side imbalance buy-side inefficiency (up candle).

### X. Specific Annotation Example: NQ Monthly

*   **Personalization:** Include personal observations and interpretations.
*   **Market Specialization:** This supports the idea of specializing in one market, with support from markets like the dollar index.
*   **Example Entry:**
    *   "The NQ monthly continuous contract has rallied strongly from October 22."
    *   "Traded down into the buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency (fair value gap) and swept the sell-side liquidity below that low."
*   **Focus:** The example focuses on salient observations and future expectations at the time of recording (August 2023).
*   **Anticipating Downside:** Anticipated a down-closed candle in September 2021 acting as a bearish breaker.
*   **Timeframe Analysis:** Analysis considered the five months of buy-side delivery leading up to the time of recording.
*   **Individual Interpretation:** Acknowledge that interpretations can vary between traders.
*   **Personalized Language:** Use phrases like "I was anticipating..." even if you didn't initially see it that way during backtesting to condition your mind.
*   **Drawing on Liquidity:** Identify potential draw to liquidity above highs or within inefficiencies.
*   **Breaker High Thresholds:** Not required for price to move all the way up to the breaker high.


Okay, here is the reorganized and enhanced version of the provided text, maintaining every detail, context, and nuance while improving clarity and readability.

### X. Specific Annotation Example: NQ Monthly (Continued Deep Dive)

*   **Rule Application & PD Array Limits:** One of the rules about a specific pattern or PD array is that we don't want to see it trade *directly* to the high. It *can*, but it's not the ideal scenario.
*   **Range Analysis:** Within this range, we observe the inefficiency and price trading into the breaker (this down-closed candle).
*   **Chart Preparation:** You need to create space on your chart. You have to scale your time axis and your price axis to allow room for annotations.
*   **Learning Language:** This is enough to give you an example. The focus is on the language being used.
*   **Example Sentences & Emotions:** I am very pleased to see price open near the high of the present August 2023 monthly candle, with subsequent delivery of lower prices.
*   **NQ Observation:** The NQ is showing respect for the January 2022 Fair Value Gap (SIBI), which is located inside the range of the ICT Bearish Breaker. I'm pleased that it's doing this very thing.
*   **Candle Explanation:** This is a monthly candle for August 2023. It opened, moved up just a little bit (it's barely visible), and then trades lower after trading into and closing in the month of July (this Fair Value Gap SIBI).
*   **Positive Emotional Terms:**
    *   The importance is on the emotionally positive terms that are being used.
    *   It's not communicating confusion.
    *   It's not recording moments where you were frustrated.
*   **Journal Rules:**
    *   Never record anything negative in your journal.
    *   Do not use your journal to record scary thoughts.
    *   Don't record periods of confusion or feeling like you just don't know.
*   **Cheerleading:** You are cheerleading yourself and annotating these charts as you do it.

### XI. Overcoming Resistance & Utilizing Brain Power

*   **Male Reluctance:** Some of you that are male are going to have a problem with this right away.
*   **Macho Mindset:**
    *   Some are like, "This is a waste of time, ICT. I got money to make."
    *   Okay, that's fine.
*   **Commitment is Key:** The majority of you that want to do this correctly will do these types of things.
*   **Brain Power:** Your brain is extremely powerful. It is the fastest, most powerful computer that will ever exist because it has a personality attached to it.
*   **Computer Limitations:** A computer can only do what a computer is programmed to do.
    *   It can make calculations.
    *   It can reason within logic that it's supplied.
*   **Human Capabilities:**
    *   You can create.
    *   You can imagine.
    *   You can regret.
    *   You can feel good.
*   **Emotional Stimuli:** You have emotional stimuli associated with your previous and future learning experiences.
*   **Journal as a Filter:** In your journal, you want to filter out every negative aspect.
*   **Acknowledging Mistakes:** That's not to say that you can't observe things that you didn't do correctly or that you felt that you didn't see coming.
*   **Framing Imperfections:** Always record it like you did, if you had something that you did incorrectly.
*   **Opportunity to Improve:** If you have a moment in price action where you know you were there that day and you were literally looking at price, and you thought something was going to happen a specific way, you want to record it in a way where it sounds like this: "This is a wonderful opportunity for me to improve upon this area here because I thought price would do XYZ."
*   **Example Scenario:** For instance, maybe you thought that in the morning session buy-side liquidity was going to be taken, but it never ran for buy-side and went the opposite direction.
*   **Journal Entry Example:** In your journal, you could record something like: "I'm grateful that I had the opportunity to learn why the sell-side was attacked over the buy-side today."
*   **Disarming Pain:** You disarmed that pain and frustration that you probably felt by watching real-time price action but didn't see it deliver like you wanted it to.
*   **Chart Annotation:** You go in and you annotate the chart.
*   **Psychological Protection:** You want to be able to record it in a way where it doesn't hurt you; it doesn't hurt you psychologically; it doesn't form a memory or a monument to a period of confusion.
*   **Avoiding Negativity:** You don't ever want to do that, because if you do those types of things, that's what many of you do with social media.
*   **Common Complaints:** You'll complain and say:
    *   "This is hard."
    *   "This is too complicated."
    *   "I'm never going to do this."
    *   "I'm struggling, and I'm about to quit."
*   **Counterproductive Actions:** Whenever you do that, you're doing the very extreme opposite of what it is that you should be doing.

### XII. The Journal as a Powerful Tool

*   **Journal as Cheerleader:** Your journal is your best cheerleading vehicle.
*   **Personalized Manual:** It's also a way for you to build the most powerful trading money-making manual you'll ever have in your hands, and you wrote it yourself.
*   **External Resources:**
    *   Buying books is not the answer.
    *   Buying courses is not the answer.
    *   Trying to trade and follow me tick by tick in real-time is not the answer.
*   **The Real Solution:** This [Journaling] is the answer. This is the thing that you're supposed to be doing.
*   **The Hard Truth:** This is the thing that most of you will not do long enough to be able to get good at reading price action.
*   **Study Old Price Action:** You have to study old price action.
*   **Positive Reinforcement:** You have to sweet-talk yourself into believing that these things were identified ahead of time by you, and you record it as such.

### XIII. Example NQ Scenario and Bias

*   **Scenario:** If NQ finds its way lower and below the ICT breaker low.
*   **Fair Value Gap:** There's a Fair Value Gap (BIZI) formed on the June 2023 monthly candle (this candle right here).
*   **Future Considerations:**
    *   You may include other things that you were identifying or saw something in here that you want to make sure you record and build up this scary area in your understanding.
    *   Your longer-term bias.
*   **Anticipating Bias Length:** How long should you expect the bias to stay in effect?
*   **Bullish Scenario:** If you've been bullish, it's reasonable to anticipate it eating up into this bearish breaker.
*   **Potential Target:** If it does, how far can it go?
*   **Buy-Side Targets:** Buy-sides are here above these highs.
*   **Inefficiency and Delivery:** You have the inefficiency, and you saw July delivered that.
*   **Wick Dynamics:** The wick goes just past it by a little bit, but that's okay because the wicks do the damage; the candlesticks tell you the story; that's the narrative.

### XIV. Transposing Annotations to the Weekly Chart

*   **Process:** Taking everything from that monthly chart and transposing it down to the weekly chart, it's very easy to do that.
*   **Toggling Timeframes:** You just toggle down to the weekly chart.
*   **Annotation Visibility:** Every annotation that you have, as long as each one of these annotations that you did on your monthly chart, are shown on all intervals.
*   **TradingView Instructions:**
    *   Hover over top of any annotation.
    *   Right-click your mouse.
    *   Click "interval" or "show intervals all" on TradingView.
*   **Outcome:** Every time you drop down to a lower timeframe or any other timeframe, the annotation you put on your higher timeframe (your monthly chart) will show up on the lower time frames, all the way down to the smallest one.

### XV. Weekly Chart Specifics: PD Arrays and Consequent Encroachment

*   **Breaker Levels:** The same breaker high, breaker low, and fair value gap on a monthly level are visible.
*   **Timeframe Labels:** Annotate your higher timeframe PD arrays with what timeframe they are.
*   **Annotation Example:** "Monthly Bearish Breaker High," "Monthly Fair Value Gap SIBI," "Monthly Bearish Breaker Low."
*   **Premium Wick Consequent Encroachment:** This is a premium wick consequent encroachment.
    *   This means this wick of this candle here; it's half of that wick.
    *   We treat wicks and tails on candlesticks like gaps.
*   **Consequent Encroachment Explained:**
    *   Every gap has an equilibrium price point.
    *   It's not called mean threshold; it's called consequent encroachment.
    *   Whenever we have a gap like this, that would have a consequent encroachment as a midpoint.
*   **Order Block Midpoint:** An order block, which is like the breaker high and the breaker low that was shown on the monthly chart, the midpoint of that (because it's an order block) midpoint is mean threshold.
*   **Fair Value Gap Midpoint:** The middle or halfway point of a gap (Fair Value Gap) would be consequent encroachment.

### XVI. Weekly Chart Analysis and Propulsion Blocks

*   **Lower Timeframe Detail:** Now we're on a lower timeframe (weekly chart), so now we can start seeing more detail.
*   **Candle Analysis:** This price action here on this very particular candle, we have a wick.
*   **Wick Projection:** That wick projected out in time is a premium wick consequent encroachment.
*   **Propulsion Block Identification:** When we drop down to the lower time frames (which will be the daily and subsequent lower time frames), this would have to be annotated as what timeframe is this (weekly).
*   **Bullish Order Block Propulsion Block:** This is a bullish order block propulsion block.
*   **Propulsion Block Reason:**
    *   This down-closed candle is your order block.
    *   Then you have a higher order block down-closed candle that does not pass through mean threshold (not on a closing basis).
*   **Trading Proximity:** We're seeing it trade very close to that opening price, but it's inside of the propulsion block, which is the high of the wick down to the opening.
*   **Propulsion Block Equilibrium:** The propulsion block has a midpoint or equilibrium price point, which would be what (consequent encroachment or mean threshold).
*   **Sensitivity Check:** We want to see does price show sensitivity there.
*   **Fair Value Gap Observation:** We also have a Fair Value Gap there. You can annotate that; I'm just mentioning here because I want to keep the chart cleaner.
*   **Price Sensitivity:** Because we have that gap, because we have an order block and a propulsion block, we might have sensitivity there this week coming up.
*   **Market Uncertainty:**
    *   Does that mean it's going to go here and go higher? I don't know.
    *   Does it mean it goes to it and through it? I don't know that.
*   **Sunday/Monday Trade:** We have to wait and see how does it trade on Sunday into Monday.
*   **Monthly Origins:** That Fair Value Gap was formed on the monthly chart, so that's why it's annotated here as monthly Fair Value Gap (BIZI buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency).
*   **Timeframe Specific Annotations:** When we get into lower time frames, this will be annotated as a weekly bullish order block propulsion block because it's framed and built on what timeframe (the weekly chart).
*   **Annotation Rules:** The annotations are as such.

### XVII. Weekly Journal Entry Example

*   **Title:** The NQ Weekly Journal Entry.
*   **Chart Type:** The NQ Continuous Weekly Chart.
*   **Consequent Encroachment Respect:** The NQ Continuous Weekly Chart respected the premium wick consequent encroachment on the weekly candle of July 17, 2023 (that's this candle here).
*   **Midpoint Reference:** The consequent encroachment or the midpoint of that wick.
*   **Current Observations:** We're seeing it respected here.
*   **Recent Trading:** This is last week's trading. It opened, traded up into it.
*   **Wick Behavior:** We wicked through, took out the previous weekly high, but the bodies are staying below the consequent encroachment of that wick.
*   **Price Delivery:** Price delivered below the previous week's low over this Fair Value Gap and trading into the propulsion block here.
*   **Appearance vs Reality:** It looks like on this chart, it looks like it's touching the opening price, but it doesn't yet.
*   **Expected Action:** We were expecting to see NQ price drop into the bullish order block propulsion block on the weekly candle of July 3, 2023 (right here that's the propulsion block), and we are expecting this very thing to happen.
*   **Recording Strategy:** I'm teaching you how to record it as you saw it coming, and then you record it here.
*   **Initial Rally Concern:** I was not overly concerned with the initial rally higher in the first part of the week of price action.
*   **Candle Narrative:** The bodies of the candles tell the narrative of price action, and again, that's annotating this very principle here; it opened, and the initial rally up that was not concerning.
*   **Not Fooled:** That was not going to be a thing that tricked us. That's not what tricked me.
*   **Anticipation:** We are anticipating prices to go up just to sucker in retail traders (the lesson formed misinformed Street money), and then delivery lower.

### XVIII. Daily Chart Integration and Market Context

*   **PD Array Labels:** Now we have these annotations here (premium wick console encouragement and bullish order block propulsion block) when we drop down to the next timeframe, which would be what (up here in the left-hand corner what's below the weekly chart the daily) so we'll have to make sure these two PD arrays are labeled weekly, so this will be a weekly premium WIC consequent encouragement and weekly bullish order block propulsion block.
*   **Daily Chart View:** Now we're down into the daily chart.
*   **Perspective Shift:** Notice how much all these candles create a completely different perspective.
*   **Training The Eye:** This is why by doing this, you train your eye and you start to see how the different time frames respect the higher timeframe PD arrays, and you also never get lost in the story and context of what price action is showing you across all of the time frames.
*   **Price Delivery Continuum:** The price delivery continuum, which is moving from higher timeframe to lower for lower to higher moving throughout the PDRA Matrix, every one of these annotations here did not appear on the weekly, nor did they all appear on the monthly.
*   **Daily Chart Specifics:** Now we're on the daily chart, so the daily chart has its own specific PD arrays, but leaning on the logic and the context that would be derived from those PD arrays from the monthly chart and the weekly chart.
*   **NQ Continuous Contract:** And again, it's the same symbol (NASDAQ number one exclamation), which is the NASDAQ continuous contract for those who have been wondering what this means.
*   **Continuous Contract Defined:** The continuous contract means that whenever the front month or the nearby contract is traded, when it expires, this chart will use the data from the new next nearby contract, and it will become the front month.
*   **Data Usage:** For instance, right now, we're trading the September contract of NASDAQ. When nasdaq's September contract expires, this chart (this NQ number one exclamation) will start using the data from the December 2023 contract.
*   **Front Month Usage:** So it's always using the front month or new nearby contract expiration; it uses that data to make the individual candlesticks.
*   **Actual Futures Contract:** If you're trading with the actual Futures Contract, you're not trading with the NQ continuous contract; you're going to be trading with the nearby contract.
*   **Trading Activity:** So whichever one has the most open interest and highest volume being traded (most actively traded, in other words), that's the one you're actually going to be Trading.
*   **Doing The Same Thing With Actual Contracts:** And you want to do this very thing here with the actual contract.
*   **September Data:** You're probably asking why did I do it with the September contract because September's contract on trading view is not going to give you the data that shows you the higher timeframe monthly, so I'm using the continuous contract here to show you that higher timeframe monthly fear value Gap city, which is this shaded area here.
*   **Daily PD Array - Fair Value Gap:** Then we have the daily chart showing you another PD array, which is this imbalance here from this candle low that candle is high, so all of this down close movement here, this sell-side delivery (not sell-side liquidity), sell-side delivery (it means the candlesticks expanding lower), this inefficiency is a daily fair value gap sibi (cell side imbalance buy side inefficiency).
*   **Price Action Example:** It traded up into the high of that civvy on Monday.
*   **More Price Action:** Then Tuesday, we traded down, got really close to the low, which would be this candle's high, and then we opened here on Wednesday, traded higher, created a volume imbalance, got lower extreme price delivery on the low end.
*   **Liquidity and Gaps:** All this sell-side delivery trades below this low here where sell-side liquidity would be and dug into this sphere value Gap, which is a fair value Gap busy (buy side imbalance sell side inefficiency).
*   **Contextual Annotations:** This is formed on the daily chart, so the annotations have to keep referencing what timeframe these PD eraser anchor dorms that way when you go into lower time frames, you're not losing sight of what levels are what everything will be in its proper place and everything will have the proper context.
*   **Bias Determination:** If you're using the higher timeframe charts to determine a narrative (a bias) where price is likely to draw to, you're going to use all these PD arrays.
*   **Complexity Question:** If you were just looking at this without me walking you through any more of it, it might be a little overwhelming, it might look a little complicated.
*   **Comprehension Unlocked:** As we go through it, you're going to see, "Oh, now that makes sense."

### XIX. Consistency and Specialization: The Keys to Success

*   **Doing The Work Yourself:** When you do this in your own charts, and you do months of it, not one day a week where you try to cram it all in one day, if that's not what you should be doing, this should be a daily meditation for you.
*   **Daily Journaling:** Every single day is a day that you must Journal. You actively do this every single day in whatever Market that you want to specialize in.
*   **Specialization Not Jack of All Trades:** This is why the folks that are trying to be jack of all trades and you you want to trade 28 markets and have 28 markets being followed all the time.
*   **Consistency Required:** If you don't have a model that you're consistent with, you're wasting your time.
*   **Efficiency Matters:** You're not doing things efficiently to do what it is that you're trying to do, which is become very good at reading price, which will eventually by default make you a better Trader.
*   **Skipping Steps:** You can't get there if you jump over this part.
*   **Promise of Success:** I promise you, if you're arm wrestling me...


Okay, here is the reorganized and enhanced version of the provided text, maintaining every detail, context, and nuance while improving clarity and readability.

### XIX. Consistency and Specialization: The Keys to Success (Continued)

*   **Addressing Internal Resistance:** If you're arm wrestling me and saying, "I don't want to do this part," "I'm never going to do it ICT," "I'm never going to journal," "I'm never going to do this kind of stuff, it's a waste of time," you will not be consistent.
*   **The Consequences of Inconsistency:**
    *   You might get lucky once in a while.
    *   You'll either be a break-even trader, or you'll eventually crash and burn.
    *   You'll never tell anybody on social media that happened, but you'll pretend that you didn't.
*   **The Path to Understanding:** Don't waste your time. Do these things I'm telling you to do, and I promise you the results, the understanding, the logic behind the model that you're seeking will literally leap off these charts and speak directly to you.
*   **Gravitating Towards Familiar Patterns:** Because the thing that you're going to gravitate to the most, whatever PD array it is, you're going to see it, and it's going to be the easiest one you see when you start doing this.

### XX. Annotation and Terminology: Seeing What's Coming

*   **Annotate Everything:** I'm not saying only annotate the one that you want to use, for instance, a Fair Value Gap or institutional order flow entry drill, or it could be anything.
*   **Avoid Forcing Patterns:** Don't force that. Always annotate everything after the fact.
*   **Use Predictive Terminology:** Use terminology in your commentary, in your annotations, like you saw it coming.
*   **The Power of Repetition:** Over time, by doing this every single trading day, and yes, it takes a little time, yes, it's going to feel tedious, yes, it's going to feel like this is counterintuitive and it's not productive, but it really, really is productive.

### XXI. Supercharging Your Learning Curve

*   **Hot-Wiring Experience:** You are hot-wiring your experience.
*   **Supercharging Learning:** You're literally going in there and supercharging and shortening your learning curve.
*   **Counterintuitive Feeling:** It doesn't feel like it; it feels like you're doing everything opposite to what you should be doing.
*   **Trading the Right Side:** You should be trying to trade the right side of the chart, but how can you do that if you don't know what you're doing?
*   **Understanding Pattern Formation:** If you don't know what you're looking for, how these things form, where do they form, what do they look like across all time frames, you cannot do it.
*   **Avoiding Wasted Time:** You'll be wasting your time trying.
*   **Months of Preparation:** It's important to anticipate that you're going to have months of doing this before you probably get really comfortable with what it is you're trying to do.
*   **Consistent Trading vs. Recognition:** That doesn't mean you're trading consistently; it just means that you're probably going to, at that time months from now, you're going to know what it is that you want to look for in price action because you've seen it repeat so many times it's obvious.

### XXII. Finding Your Unique Model

*   **Personal Preference:** Whichever PD array you like, you'll know.
*   **Avoid Imitation:** Don't take the ones that I'm talking about the most.
*   **Obscure Patterns:** It might be an obscure one like the mitigation block.
*   **Unique Model Development:** All of my students are different; they're all going to pick something that makes more sense to them.
*   **Evolving Preferences:** Many times, the nature style is going to be everybody wants to do order blocks, but then they discover the Fair Value Gap, then they discovered the model 2022.
*   **Silver Bullet Setup:** So, and now we have a silver bullet setup, which is time-based.
*   **Potential Model Candidates:** All these things, okay, they're potential candidates for you to build a model around that is Uniquely Yours.
*   **Avoid Forcing It:** But don't try to force it by doing this practice of annotating and logging with price action actually did.

### XXIII. Recording and Reinforcing Annotations

*   **Proper Annotation:** Then recording the annotations properly and organized.
*   **Supportive Self-Talk:** Then giving yourself annotations that were supportive, saying well done to yourself for seeing it coming beforehand, and then delivering what you thought it would.
*   **Tricking the Subconscious:** You didn't probably do that, but again, you're tricking your subconscious, and you're tricking yourself into believing by repetition looking at these old charts because these journal entries will be referred to later on at the end of the week, at the end of the month.

### XXIV. Continuous Review and Reinforcement

*   **Frequent Review:** Look at previous week and the week before that. You constantly go back and look at this over and over again.
*   **Movie Analogy:** It's like watching a movie you saw many times before. You know what's going to be said, you know what the actors are wearing, you know the outcome, but you're continuously watching it because why? You like that movie.
*   **Personal Connection:** I have dozens of them that I I like watching, and I know the script, I know the words are going to say, I know the mannerism. I even say it just the same way that they do sometimes, and sometimes I'm in the shower, and I'm repeating a movie scene because I'm looking forward to watching it again.
*   **Meaningful Content:** Why? Because it means something to me; it holds a special place in my heart.
*   **Romance with Price Action:** That's what you're trying to do with price action; you're falling in love with reading price.

### XXV. The Inescapable Requirement for Long-Term Profitability

*   **Critical Aspect:** If you do not fall in love with this part of it or this aspect of what trading is, you cannot, absolutely underscore, cannot be consistently long-term profitable. That's it.
*   **Romance with Price:** This is how you have a romance with price action. You do this very thing.
*   **Love Letters to the Future:** You're writing love letters to your future self, encouraging your future self, and you're saying these are all the beautiful things I love about price action.

### XXVI. Analogies: Price Action as a Relationship

*   **Avoiding Negativity:** Just like you want to be able to tell your your significant other, you don't want to go up to your significant other and say, you know, honey, you got some really ugly hammer toes, okay? I don't know what's going on, you got some toe jams, we got, we gotta take care of that. You're never gonna do that, not survive [Laughter].
*   **Focusing on Positives:** So you want to do what? You want to say, "Honey, you look so nice today, that's a lovely perfume you're wearing, what did you do to your hair? It looks beautiful today."
*   **Cultivating Positivity:** What are you doing? You're focusing on all the positive because you know you don't want to go in a dog house. You don't want to be separated from the the good aspects of being in that relationship with that person because you're going to say something that's negative.
*   **Journaling Rules:** You don't want to do that in your Journal because what you're doing is you're trying to cultivate the sweetest romance between you and price action.
*   **Developing Intimacy with Price:** You want to have a close-knit relationship with price. You want to be able to warm up to price real quick, see it when it starts trading real time, so, "Oh yeah, I know what you're doing, honey, you do this all the time."

### XXVII. Understanding Price's Quirks

*   **Long-Term Partnership:** Just like when you're with a long-term relationship partner, you know what they're going to do, how they wake up, how they act before they have their coffee, you know how they act before they go to bed.
*   **Personal Quirks:** You're either a night person, or they're a morning person; you know their little personal little quirky things.
*   **Learning Price's Quirks:** This is how you learn what price does in its own unique personal quirky things, and then that relationship and that language, that love language between you and price action, then it develops into what a long-term committed relationship, which is positive profitability, consistency, longevity, all those things.

### XXVIII. Avoiding Drama and Fostering Love

*   **No Drama:** And you don't have drama. You don't want to invite drama into your relationship with price action, so you start it as a love story.
*   **Sweet Talk:** You sweet talk it, you sweet talk yourself, your future self, all this is what you're doing by back testing.
*   **Back Testing as Conditioning:** That is back testing. That's my way of conditioning you as a student to go in and fall in love with what price does because it does these things over and over and over again.
*   **Familiarity and Expertise:** Just like your spouse, your significant other would know things that you do all the time, they know you're like a well-read book, they know you like the back of their hand the same way you know them.

### XXIX. Comprehensive Approach: Combining Timeframes and PD Arrays

*   **Timeframe Integration:** So, by looking at the monthly chart and the weekly chart and having those respective PD arrays annotated on the daily chart, then we look at the daily chart and identify what that time frame offers us.
*   **Comprehensive Analysis:** So, we have a complete and comprehensive approach from the highest time frames, which is monthly, weekly, and now daily.
*   **Proper Labeling:** And every specific PD array must be properly labeled; otherwise, you will lose sight of what it is you're looking at.

### XXX. In-Depth Analysis of a Specific Scenario

*   **Contextualizing Fair Value Gaps:** This range up here, is that fair value Gap (CB) on the monthly chart that was below the monthly breaker High and between that and the monthly breaker low, which is this level here.
*   **Daily Fair Value Gap (BIZI):** This daily fair value Gap in the form of a busy, which is an up close candle, this is only seen on the daily chart, and this is that monthly fair value sales on efficiency. We have a sibi here, so it's a daily fair value Gap sibi.
*   **Candle Explanation:** The candle was down; down candles that make a fair value Gap is a city, up close candles that make a fairway Gap is a busy Okay, so this inefficiency here forms it what part of this monthly fair value Gap City.
*   **Nested PD Arrays:** So, in other words, between this Range High and this range low from the monthly chart, now where is this sibi forming in the lower half of it?
*   **Midpoint Observation:** Did you notice that high to low that pink Range halfway points about right here, so the high of that City also is in close proximity to the consequent encroachment, which is not labeled here, of the high and low, you might want to include that in your chart.
*   **Convergence:** We're observing, we're appreciating, and recording the logic behind nested PD arrays.
*   **Unseen Levels:** There's a convergence if you will of PD arrays and levels that would otherwise go unnoticed by you or anyone else out there.

### XXXI. Application of Knowledge and Avoiding Shortcuts

*   **Past Practices:** And these are the types of things that I have done in the past years ago when I would do recorded executions, and people would say, you know, why is he trading there?
*   **Significance of Areas:** Like what what's so significant about that area? It's things like this, and I can say it in passing, say, "Hey, look, you know, it's a monthly fair value Gap and check your charts for homework."
*   **Active Learning:** You want to look at the monthly chart, there's a uh in inefficiency around that price level.
*   **Avoiding Passive Learning:** But see, you don't want to do that; you just want to watch me do a new trick.
*   **Chart Engagement:** I want you to go into the charts and do this very thing here, which is what every one of my profitable students are doing and have done.
*   **No Exception:** You're not going to be the exception; stop arm wrestling it.

### XXXII. Further Analysis and Potential Inversion

*   **Fair Value Gap (SIBI):** So, we also have this area here, which is a what fair value, yeah, but think now, if this is an inefficiency, and it's a fair value Gap, what kind of fair value Gap is this?
*   **Identifying Inefficiencies:** Buy sell and balance sell sign inefficiency, just like this one is down here, but what does this become if this area up here is creating some measure of unlikely price delivery going lower, and then we see support behind that idea where price does this very thing here.
*   **Inversion Fair Value Gap:** As soon as this candle trades down below these lows and below this candle's High, which is the low of this by side of balance cell sign efficiency, which is a fair value Gap, this pass through, this candle here makes this and this a potential what inversion fair value Gap what what time frame does it form on the daily chart see we're up here daily.
*   **Contextual Annotation:** So your annotation here is the daily inversion fair value Gap High, which is this candle is low, and this candle is high, which is the daily inversion fair value got low.
*   **Narrative-Based Interpretation:** An inversion fair value Gap is narrative-based.

### XXXIII. The Narrative of Inversion Fair Value Gaps

*   **Contextual Understanding:** If we take away the context of it wanting to go lower prior to this lower, this is just simply a fairway Gap by Center balance also inefficiency, but as soon as we have price deliver to the sell side and then attack cell side liquidity and Pierce the low end range of that bison efficiency this sets the tone.
*   **Strategic Levels:** We've already established that early on that we were looking for lower prices, so that means we can use the midpoint or the low or the lower quadrant.
*   **Specific Price Levels:** Notice there's three specific levels there, not a Zone very specific price levels midpoint.
*   **Consequent Encroachment:** Well, what's the midpoint of an insertion of a gap the same thing that we would call the middle of a fair value Gap, the same thing we would call the middle of a wick or a tail consequent encroachment.
*   **Observation:** So, we see the daily inversion fair value got consequent encroachment is right there.

### XXXIV. Differentiating Fair Value Gaps

*   **Understanding Liquidity Void:** So anyone else watching my videos if they don't really go through the process of doing this or learning or take good notes they're going to assume that the Market's going to go all the way back out to here because they'll say this is a liquidity void and the Market's going to want to have to go up there not when it's like this like what we have a higher time frame monthly fear Vega we went up and repriced to it.
*   **Rebalancing and Repricing:** We went up to it one more time halfway consequent encroachment and we also rebalanced this area here because we went up into repricing it and then we left the range there so now this is a balanced price range.
*   **Two Premium Arrays:** We had one two premium arrays supporting what lower prices.

### XXXV. Identifying the Bearish Order Block

*   **Passthrough:** As soon as we pierced through this low here this level here not that very candle this low of the inversion fair value got we don't know it's an inversion fair value Gap until price does this pass through.
*   **Anticipation:** Then we can anticipate the market likely to reach up into the midpoint between this candles below and this candle's high and that midpoint is daily inversion fairy value got consequent encroachment said midpoint between this level here and this level there we trade up to here trade lower and close there.
*   **The Next Candle:** Next candle we open trade up one more time trading above the previous day's High trading up into consequent encroachment of the inversion fair value Gap and what is this candle here this big beefy candle.
*   **Bearish Order Block Definition:** This candle here is the bearish order block notice this camera does not Pierce or engulf this previous candle.

### XXXVI. Order Block and Institutional Order Flow

*   **The opening price is pierced:** As soon as that opening price is pierced to the downside right there on that candle this becomes a bearish order block.
*   **Mean Threshold (midpoint of range) or Consequent Encroachment?**: Now because this is an order block we can take that range from the low to the high halfway point of that is what consequent encroachment no mean threshold.
*   **Lower Prices Expected**: If we have the inversion fair value Gap consequent encroachment which is half of this by Center balance outside efficiency the main point of that if we have that and we have the opening of this bearish order block and potential institutional order flow entry drill we're expecting lower prices and we have an inversion fair value Gap.

### XXXVII. Managing Expectations and Risk

*   **Limited Chance of High-end Breaker Reaching (if any)**: Can it go back up to the inversion favorite value get high yes the chances of it doing that are Slim by far and large many times you're going to see that inversion Fair rate gaps given this type of movement where we've moved about five months One Direction we hit a premium array there's no reason really to go up to the high of the breaker.
*   **Trading Low or Mean Threshold:** Essentially the breaker is a pattern that you want to trade the low or mean threshold of you don't want to see it trade the the high end if it does it becomes a little less likely doesn't mean it can't go there it just means that I don't like to see that and if it does that and I'm in a trade I will scale something off to remove the measure of risk that I'm holding if I see it trading through the high of the breaker because if it trades the high of the breaker it means that it's not as bearish as I want it to be and you don't want to see it trade up here.
*   **Lower Prices and Premuim Arrays are linked:** If it's bearish we want to see premium arrays not be reached. If we're bearish if we see premium arrays in our pdra Matrix in the the fractal that we're studying in price action that means all the data that's being shown here if we can clearly identify where specific


Okay, here is the reorganized and enhanced version of the provided text, maintaining every detail, context, and nuance while improving clarity and readability.

### XXXVIII. Understanding Market Dynamics: Order Flow, Premium Arrays, and Discount Arrays

*   **Bearish Order Flow:** If we are indeed bearish, we don't want to see **premium arrays** traded to. Instead, we want to see **discount arrays** draw price towards them, with everything smashed through down closed candles.
*   **Revealing Order Flow Through Candlesticks:** This candlestick pattern signifies that order flow is bearish.
*   **Candlesticks vs Indicators:** No need for a DOM, VWAP, component control, or volume profile; everything needed is visible within the candlestick itself.
*   **Importance of Timing:** You just need to know what you're looking at, *by time*.

### XXXIX. Weekly Premium Wick and Coloring Outside the Lines

*   **Respecting the Weekly Premium Wick:** We observed that the **weekly premium wick consequent encroachment** was being respected (bodies right there). No bodies crossed over it, but wicks did.
*   **Chart Annotation:** Annotating your chart like this shows how lower time frames interact with it slightly.
*   **Permissible Price Action:** When it does that, and if you're bearish, you condition yourself to accept it, recognizing it is permissible in price action.
*   **Stop Loss Considerations:** You might get scared out or put your stop loss just above, but it’s not enough.
*   **Remaining Objective:** But I'm not scared or changing my opinion about where the market's going, because there might be a small little mohawk (little deviation) outside the levels I'm looking for. This is all *normal coloring outside the lines*.
*   **Algorithm as a "Baby":** This algorithm is my baby; it's my child.

### XL. Tolerating Price Action "Fingerprints"

*   **Non-Judgmental Approach:** When I look at price action, and it colors outside the lines, I'm still going to take this chart and hang it on my refrigerator, hang it on my desk.
*   **Recognizing Normal Behavior:** It's something my child has done, and I know that these are my child's fingerprints, so I don't worry about these things when I'm looking at it, and I'm not judgmental about what price did in these areas when it's normal to see that very thing.
*   **Avoiding Anxiety:** You won't grow anxious when you're studying price and it's behaving this way, because it's something you expect and it's likely to occur.
*   **Counteracting Fear:** Where everyone else might get scared or stopped out, or they may even change their opinion about where they think the market's going because the market creates these little wicks at the real at the time watching it.
*   **Visualizing Real-Time Price Action:** This is a full-blown bullish green candle at the highest high of that, you know, when it touches the candle low there real time.

### XLI. The Anticipation of Price Action

*   **Expecting Receding Price:** I'm expecting it to just bump just above it a little bit and then recede back into the range.
*   **Conditioning with Annotations:** When you start doing these types of annotations, it conditions you to anticipate that very thing.
*   **Tape Reading:** So when you were watching real-time price action or tape reading, you will have that in your mind because you've seen many examples of it.
*   **Confidence Builder:** When you start getting real comfortable with it, and it happens to do this that very thing, it feels really good. It's a confidence builder.
*   **Avoiding Overconfidence:** It's not an overconfidence creator, it's a confidence builder, and it builds this understanding about price action that you would never otherwise get unless you were actually doing these types of things and recording it and showing snapshots over time.

### XLII. The Importance of Consistent Journaling

*   **Lifelong Journaling:** Not just "I did it for two weeks ICT, I'm done back testing". No, journaling is something you're going to do the rest of your career.
*   **Imitation and Logging:** You want to be able to imitate and log everything, and the more you pour into this part of it, the better you're going to be.

### XLIII. Understanding Key Areas and Breakaway Gaps

*   **Avoiding the Breached City:** So we wouldn't want to see this area up here in this city be traded to.
*   **Separation from Inversion Fair Value Gap High:** We don't want to see that because above the daily inverse repair by Gap High, we have this separation from this candle's low in the high, which is this Candlestick load that's the inversion Fairbank app high.
*   **Audience Awareness:** Right away, if this is one of the first times you ever watched one of my videos, this isn't where you start. This is for people that have been with me for a while, and they just want to know how to journal.
*   **Starting Point - 2022 Mentorship:** So before you even get to this part, you got to watch some videos. There's a lot of things you need to look at, and then if the first time you watch the video, watch my **2022 mentorship 41 videos**. Just watch that one, and it'll give you some context.
*   **Wednesday Market Action:** But then the Market opens here on Wednesday, we open rally up and then Crush the sell side liquidity, and we go below the low the daily inversion pair that you got that makes this low a real low of an inversion wherever you got Market trades the next day on Thursday opens rallies up touches the low of this candle here which is what that's your **bearish order block**.
*   **Bearish Order Block Consideration:** It can trade to that level and up to the opening price.
*   **Coloring Outside the Lines:** Can it just stop and dead in its tracks? Yeah, but what do we allow for? *Coloring Outside the Lines.*
*   **Mohawk Example:** So that opening price extended forward what are we seeing right here? The same element of price delivery that's going on right there. This is a mohawk.

### XLIV. Market Dynamics and Premium Arrays

*   **Market Underpinnings:** Because the market dynamics and the underpinnings of the marketplace is it's wanting to go lower.
*   **Anticipating Coloring Outside the Lines:** So it's the one to go lower likely to go lower anytime it goes to a premium array that does touch, it does deliver to anticipate a little bit of coloring outside the lines and not freak out thinking it's going to give way, which is the reason why I have a roll of three PD arrays.
*   **PD Array Strategy:** One, the first one it can do this, and then that's all there is. It can do this, and then trade into the second PD array that I would be viewing as a defense.
*   **Three PD Array Rule:** But if I have three PD arrays, if I'm bearish, if it trades through three PD arrays, I'm probably wrong, and if I haven't been stopped out, I'm going to take the trade off and remove myself from risk.

### XLV. Real Trade Example

*   **Live Trade Example:** Many times and you watch me recently trade a live account live trade in the NQ or Nasdaq real Futures Contract not a demo.
*   **Twitter Reference:** You can see that over there on my Twitter account.
*   **Scaling Off Trade:** I was in a trade, and I had one PD array of the three breached, and it was approaching the second one, and my third one was so close and right above my second PD array that if it went to my second one, I was going to collapse the trade entirely and remove myself from risk.
*   **Precision and Knowledge:** So it's a matter of knowing all these things that you just can't get from an ICT video one time.
*   **Compressing Bandwidth:** There's no way to compress and put all this bandwidth into one single individual presentation not not and had the Precision that you see me sharing and what my students are able to utilize on their trading.

### XLVI. Breakaway Gaps and Order Flow

*   **Breakaway Gap Defined:** So this area up here becomes what between the daily inversion fair value Gap High which is this candle's low so this candle is low here that makes this what a **breakaway Gap**.
*   **Unannotated Detail:** It's not annotated, right? It's for you to go in and dig into it.
*   **Institutional Order Flow Entry Drill:** So we see it trade up into the **bearish order block** opening price And Trades about this candle is high rate there on Friday which is a **institutional order flow entry drill**.
*   **Fair Value Gap Entry:** What is that? It is a entry taken that would be inside of a imbalance like a fair value Gap.
*   **Fair Value Gap Types:** We don't want to see this area traded to because why we have this High here that you could trade to and create a turtle soup trade up above it and reject good alert which is what it did.
*    **Down Candle = SIBI:** That means it's a down candle that delivers the fair Vega just the opposite of what a busy is.
*    **Up Candle = BIZI:** Obviously is a fairway Gap that has an up close candle civi what you remember easy is civi is sell side delivery sell off busy buy side delivery buy up okay that's the way you can remember it.

### XLVII. Permissible Price Action: Coloring Outside the Lines

*   **Trading to ICT Opening Price:** How far can it go about that? ICT opening price here is your **bearish order block** that should change in state delivery rate there.
*   **Permissible Price Action:** And it can go up to that area there and go through it just a little bit it's permissible price action coloring Outside the Lines.
*   **Aggressive Delivery:** And then we see delivery aggressive throughout the day and going lower taking out Thursday's low digging deeper into this box out of balance inefficiency right there, and it's a daily-based PD array.

### XLVIII. Weekly Bullish Order Block and Consequent Encroachment

*   **Propulsion Block:** The next one is the weekly bullish order block propulsion block.
*   **Charting Observation:** You can see now now that we're on a daily chart it didn't quite get there yet.
*   **Assumption for Lower Prices:** That would be my next assumption for you know if it goes lower and then obviously the entire closure and delivery back to this candle is high it doesn't need to do that.
*   **Trading into Imbalance:** We've done enough trading into this Python and balance cell certain efficiency the close here is real close to **consequent encroachment** which is not annotated here but I want you to annotate that on your charts and look at in the lower time frames on the Thursday's price action and Friday of last week.

### XLIX. Annotations and Weekly Profiles

*   **NQ Contract Delivery:** With all that said the annotations I have over here is that the enqueue continuous daily contract delivered the lower prices I expected from the monthly fair value Gap sibi the weekly profile.
*   **Profile Disclaimer:** Now when I say profile I do not use Market profile I do not use volume turned sideways plotted on my charts I don't do that.
*   **Rejecting Volume/Market Profile:** I don't use depth of Market I don't use v-wop I don't use any of that kind of stuff to me they're gimmicks if you believe in them that's your religion I Ain't Gonna Knock you for your religion but it has nothing to do with why price goes up or down.
*   **Templates:** Weekly profiles to me are like templates what is the roadmap that price is likely to follow.

### L. Monday High of the Week Bearish Profile

*   **Bearish Profile:** This weekly profile was an obvious **Monday high of the week bearish profile** that formed immediately after the daily fair value Gap sibi was redelivered to on the Monday price action.
*   **Action on Monday:** That means here's Monday's price action here we opened traded down rallied up to the high which is the low of this candle this is that City the fair value got civi it goes up here delivers it to a Monday and stops trading right there.
*   **Action on Tuesday:** Then on Tuesday we opened trade up a little bit and then slam lower the weekly profile was an obvious Monday high of the week bearish profile that formed immediately after the daily fair value Gap sibi was redelivered to on the Monday price action see what language I'm using there the weekly profile was an obvious Monday high of the week.
*   **Anticipating Weekly Profile:** Now I knew the likelihood of it forming on Mondays high but you may not have but in your annotations you want to record it like you were anticipating it going further.
*   **Confirming Bias on Wednesday:** Wednesday proved my bearish bias on the week was absolutely correct by creating a lower gap opening that's this here you opened here traded up you've got from the previous day we got and then the large range okay in the lower this led to an amazing large range down close day for NQ.
*   **Inversion Fair Value Gap Target:** The daily range on the Wednesday extended past the inversion fair value got low which telegraphed the high probability of repricing to the inversion fair value got consequent encroachment before repricing lower on Friday's price action that's saying this candle went below this candle's High which is this inefficiency so this inefficiency was a fair value Gap we went through it here that makes this potentially a inversion Fair Vega meaning that it has a lot of probability that's going to go up to the midpoint of it why shouldn't it good that are high I just spent time talking about it.
*   **Breakaway Gap and Order Flow:** This area up here we want to see that stay open as a fair value Gap no as a breakaway cap and then Friday we see it open trades up in here and then slams it back down Friday wasn't easy short selling day with the bearish institutional order flow entry drill and bearish Order block inside of the inversion fair value Gap and using the inversion fair value Gap consequent encroachment as the ideal premium PD array to expect the higher the data form on.
*   **Non-Farm Payroll Context:** Now this is again recording it on the context of disrespecting the fact that it's not from payroll Friday somewhere in here you want to record that this was non-farm payroll Friday that you wouldn't be trading that day necessarily as a new student but you can still see and repeat appreciate the the price action and delivery of that occurring.

### LI. NASDAQ 4-Hour Analysis

*   **Alignment of Timeframes:** Moving on to the NASDAQ four hour you can see again all the annotations that were on the monthly the weekly and now the daily.
*   **Annotations Carried Over:** Say the daily fair value Gap City daily inversion for everybody got high daily inversion favorite consequent encouragement and daily inversion fair value Gap below daily institutional order flow integral daily bearish order block daily fair value Cap City and now we have elements inside of the four hour chart like we see here the four hour bearish order block over here change in state deliveries there.
*   **Mohawk Observation:** Market opens on this four hour chart trades up what's it doing it's trading just above that candlestick's opening price this is permissible price action this is a mohawk okay it's just a little bit outside the lines that's absolutely permissible the market trades there lower opens here and moves lower again.
*   **Daily SIBI:** This area in here is indicating that inside of this daily fair value Gap sibi there's a little bit more detail as to why we would not reasonably expect the daily chart to see price action go above that daily inversion variable you got Pi y look closer from this candlestick's low.
*   **Identifying Ranges:** To this candlesticks High that is your daily this is the daily inversion fair value Gap High the midpoint of that inversion variable you got which Costco encroachment and the low of the daily inversion fair value got below.

### LII. Balanced Price Range and Algorithmic Signatures

*   **Price Action Detailing:** Why did we not expected to trade up in this area here on the daily it was showing in one single pass but on a four hour chart you can see it went down and then the next candle we opened and went back up there again and then down damn delivery in here as well so what is happening here went lower lower back up lower so this is what balanced so this is a balanced price range so what do we have from the daily inversion Fairbank app High to the Daily inversion fair value Gap consequent encroachment we have a balanced price range.
*   **Combining Indicators:** Nailing the bearish order block opening price coupling it with a Confluence of the daily inversion for everybody got consequent encroachment of that gap on the daily chart that we saw trade through it here and then we expect the midpoint of that to act as what the high on Friday it's not likely to go all the way through all this just to get back up into a little area here let me go back up to the deal chart.
*   **Chart Demonstration:** Think about this little area right here okay now I'm going to show you that on a daily chart that's this little area right there go on your own charts and you'll see what I'm talking about this little area here is not likely to see all that trade back up to this is going to stay open why because on the four hour chart this is all balanced back and forth price action so there's no there's no inefficiency there's no liquidity that's necessary to trade to.
*   **Attention to Inversion Levels:** So when we trade down through the daily inversion forever you got low here our attention goes to the Daily inversion fair value got consequent encroachment and the likelihood of that becoming or just a little bit above it like we see here creating the Friday High and we trade up small little Mohawk above the bearish order block opening price which is this change in state of delivery just a little bit above the daily inversion Fairway got consequent encouragement here and then we see what non-prone payroll rip through it and then attack the low here there digging into that daily fair value sales and efficiency.

### LIII. Recognizing Strong Algorithmic Signatures

*   **Rebalance Observation:** Now notice in here also we have this down move here in the next candle we open and when the candle opened here this Wick hadn't formed yet so between this candlestick's low and where we opened this candle was just one single pass down which would be looking much like a what fair value Gap sibi but this candle does what immediately trades up hits the low and goes just a little bit past that what is that it's permissible price action And Trades lower that is my immediate rebalance when it does that whenever it does that and you have a bias that's bullish or bearish in this case it immediately rebalanced here that is one of the strongest algorithmic signatures you're going to ever see in price action.
*   **Future Content:** I'll have much more to talk about that in my.


Okay, here is the reorganized and enhanced version of the provided text, maintaining every detail, context, and nuance while improving clarity and readability.

### LIV. Algorithmic Signatures and Market Bearishness

*   **Reminder of Prior Mention:** Just reminding you that I've already mentioned it here on my YouTube channel.
*   **Long-Term Student Awareness:** My long-term students know about this intimately.
*   **Immediate Rebalance Signifier:** This immediate rebalance is one of those things that tells you that this market is going to be extremely bearish, and it's going to move fast.
*   **Subsequent Market Run-Off:** And then we see it run off.
*   **Four-Hour PD Array:** We have a four-hour PD array in the form of an immediate rebalance.
*   **Four-Hour Bearish Order Block:** And then we have a four-hour bearish order block.
*   **Limited Four-Hour Chart Importance:** Apart from that, nothing else on the four-hour chart is anything of importance to me.

### LV. NQ Four-Hour Journal Entry Analysis

*   **Annotation Focus:** The annotations here show you that the NQ four-hour journal entry, the NQ continuous four-hour contract.
*   **Weekly Premium Wick Impact:** Shows how nicely the **weekly premium wick consequent encroachment** kept price from rallying higher this week.
*   **Key Level:** That's this level here.
*   **Tuesday Bearish Order Block:** **Tuesday bearish order block and gap opening lower** was the start of the descent and subsequent sell program.
*   **Aggressive Sell-Off:** It's hitting that and sells off aggressively as it enters the cell program.
*   **Daily Fair Value Gap SIBI:** **Daily fair value Gap SIBI** can be seen as well-balanced in the gray area.
*   **Balanced Area:** That's this area right in here; all of this is well balanced because it's back-and-forth price action.
*   **Reinforced Probabilities:** Which reinforced the probabilities of the **daily inversion fair value Gap consequent encroachment** being Friday's high of the day.
*   **Actual Occurrence:** And we see that actually occurring here.
*   **Difficulty of Breaching:** So it's going to have a real hard time getting through all this back-and-forth delivery when, on a daily chart, it looks like it's inefficient up here when it's not.

### LVI. Price Delivery Continuum and Timeframe Importance

*   **Price Delivery Continuum:** That's the **price delivery Continuum** that I'm referring to.
*   **Higher Timeframe Awareness:** You have to know what your higher time frames are showing you.
*   **Lower Timeframe Details:** And then inside of those time frames, you get into the details because, as I'm showing you here, the lower time frames are going to show you a much more refined rendition of price delivery that is not always easily ascertained by looking at the higher time frame.
*   **Long-Term Bias:** The bias in the long-term draw on liquidity, that's the importance of those higher time frames.
*   **Refining Precision:** But the importance of the lower time frame is refining Precision.
*   **Not Noise:** It's not noise.

### LVII. Hourly Chart Analysis and Presentation Focus

*   **Moving to Hourly Chart:** Moving down into the hourly chart here, this is the last time frame we're going to look at in this presentation.
*   **Presentation Duration:** Because obviously, you can see it's very easy for me to go on and on and make this a very challenging presentation in terms of duration.
*   **Student Preference:** I know some of you, my well-rounded students, like the really, really long lectures.
*   **Concise Presentation Goal:** But I want to keep it as short and as concise as possible but still hitting the most Salient points because I want all of you to be doing these types of things.
*   **Personal Application:** Because you don't do it, you're not going to learn how to do it well.

### LVIII. Hourly Chart: Respect and Negation of PD Arrays

*   **Reference Points:** We're looking at the 16-minute chart or hourly chart, and we have all of the reference points now.
*   **Market Disparity:** Obviously, this looks like an entirely different market now, doesn't it, from the monthly chart, the weekly chart, the daily chart doesn't even resemble the same market at all.
*   **Unified Market:** But yet it is the same market.
*   **Price Delivery Continuum Application:** So we're using that price delivery Continuum working from the higher time frame down, looking at how each individual PD array respects and or is negated.
*   **Monthly Fair Value Gap SIBI:** In here, we see that **monthly fair value Gap SIBI**, this is that shaded area here.
*   **Breaker High/Low:** The monthly breaker high is outside the range of this time frame; the monthly breaker low is outside the time frame of this analog chart.
*   **Chart Condensation:** If we were to scrub down and squeeze or condense this chart vertically, it would be up here higher, and the low of the breaker would be lower than this.
*   **Zoomed-In View:** For the purpose of showing the one-hour chart time frame, the respective PD arrays, and what was Salient for this time frame, I've zoomed in just to show you this.
*   **Daily Inefficiency:** But you can see this is that daily, you get by sending balance sell sign efficiency, and the monthly fair value Gap sippy.
*   **Premium/Discount Levels:** So we know the two premium and premium and discount levels.

### LIX. PD Array Labeling and Personal Trading Style

*   **PD Array Labeling Importance:** And inside that daily fair value Gap City, you can see how it's important that you label your PD arrays.
*   **Organized Approach:** You can't just throw a box or a rectangle in there and assume that you're going to remember what it is and how to use it.
*   **Consistent Organization:** So everything has to be organized, everything has to have its place, and all the time frames that you utilize.
*   **Key Levels:** The **weekly premium WIC consequent encouragement**, the **four-hour bearish order block**.
*   **Fair Value Gap:** Now we have this sphere of a gap here; where's annotation for that?
*   **Convergence Elements:** It's coupled with the **four-hour immediate rebalance** and **60-Minute premium fair value Gap City**, that's this one right here.
*   **Candlestick Body Consequent Encroachment:** What's the candlesticks bodies showing you, consequent encouragement, half of this gap.
*   **Wick Coloring Outside the Lines:** But what are the Wicks doing, coloring Outside the Lines just trading just a little bit outside, which is completely reasonable.
*   **Daily Fair Value Gap SIBI:** But what is it touching the previous daily fair value Gap City? That's not random.
*   **Numerical Level List:** So I have in my notes when I'm working with price action when I'm trading, I have all these levels here just as a list, just like you see price from 15 840, and then below that, you see 15 800, and then below that, fifteen six seven sixty.
*   **Paper-Based System:** I have every respective PD array that I'm showing you here just in number format and its annotation label just on a piece of paper, that's all it is.
*   **Chart Independence:** So I don't need a chart, like I don't, I don't need a chart to trade.
*   **Time and Paper Trading:** I just need a piece of paper and know what time it is, and I can trade off of that.
*   **Convergence of Elements:** This 60-minute favorite Gap is a convergence with that four-hour immediate rebalance.
*   **Convergence Implication:** What does that mean, this movement right here is this.

### LX. Integrating Multiple Timeframes

*   **Relating Timeframes:** Let me go back up to the four-hour chart, so that way you know what I'm looking at and what you're being shown, this candle here opening rallying up right there.
*   **Four-Hour Candle Breakdown:** This candle right there, that four-hour candle inside that four-hour candle is this right here, one, two, three, four candles because four single 60-minute candles is that four-hour chart.
*   **Rebalance Creation:** That's that market rallying back up creating a four-hour immediate rebalance, then what does it do?
*   **Short Entry:** It creates this, how could you use that well, if you're looking at an hourly chart as soon as it does this complete run up and then the body closes down in here if we open here and rally and touch the top of that fair value Gap or here's the really fun part if we extend past that fair value got right in here right in there as soon as we trade above that I could go short there, you can go short there.
*   **Stop Loss Placement:** Where would your stop Need to Be Right Above That Swing high right there.
*   **Breakaway Gap Expectation:** Why because this is a fair Vegas, you can't use this one, you can't use the stop right about that because it's the low of that previous daily fair value Gap Simi it can touch that that's that's reasonable, but this High here it shouldn't go there if it's bearish it shouldn't go there why because this should act as a breakaway Gap.
*   **Sell-Off into Balance:** Sells off and now we go back into this balance price range.

### LXI. Refined Observations and Algorithmic Behavior

*   **Further Examination:** You can see again all this back-and-forth delivery that isn't readily available in terms of looking at it on a daily chart, but now look even closer.
*   **Fibonacci Tool Application:** If we take this candlesticks low, which is the high of this daily fair value Gap City, so this shaded pink area here, but this candle is low so this candle is high that's the range.
*   **Daily Fair Value Gap Range:** That creates that daily fair value Gap City if we drop a fib well neck handle is low and that candle's high and you add in the 0.75 or the 0.25 whichever direction you're pulling the Fib from the lower quadrant of that daily fair value Gap City that's this shaded area here.
*   **Friday Body Respect:** Notice what perhaps also on Friday, look at the bodies it's respecting that lower quadrant trades up in there, there's a mohawk right there institutional refrigerator drill bang sell short sell side relative equal lows sell side hello.
*   **Consistent Charting Benefits:** I want you to know that you know doing these types of things it's imperative that you are consistent by doing it and by annotating your charts and pulling out what's obvious to you after the fact it will help reassure yourself going forward looking at that hard right Edge because you'll remember things by associating with them previous memories that you've created by journaling you're condensing and compressing time in a manner with experience that didn't technically happen but you're recording in such a way that it tricks your brain into thinking that you did you see it coming.

### LXII. 60-Minute Chart Annotation and Narrative

*   **60-Minute Contract Annotation:** The annotation for the 60-Minute chart here is the NQ continuous 60-Minute contract presented a really easy Wednesday two o'clock in the morning fair value Gap City, that's this candle right there.
*   **Rebalance Posting:** When the four-hour posted its immediate rebalance, that's this movement here.
*   **Lower Quadrant Respect:** And you can be seen respecting the lower quadrant of the daily fair value Gap City on Friday at noon, that's here, that's this level here, it's the lower quadrant of this shaded area half of it's here and an upper quadrant would be here.
*   **Non-Payroll Activity:** Interesting enough that it touches that, and then this one here, now I ain't making a big deal about that because the inefficiency wasn't created until that movement.
*   **Future Talks:** But look that right there, we'll talk about that in my book.
*   **Candle Narrative:** As the bodies of the candles tell the narrative of lower prices into the close, and we have that there.
*   **Non-Farm Payroll Impact:** So non-front payroll takes out the lows here after taking buy side then sell side, that's what my farm payroll does it runs both sides of the marketplace and I've taught that many times, and it delivered again like gangbusters.

### LXIII. Journaling Benefits and Encouragement

*   **Hope for Insight:** Hopefully, you found this one insightful.
*   **Value of Learning:** I hope you learned something about how you can journal and the benefits of doing so and how it builds an understanding about price actions you can't get by watching videos or reading books or listening to anybody just talk about price even watching them trade or copying them.
*   **Personal Chart Annotation:** You'll never get this type of insight unless you go into your own chart to annotate them and do it as a daily meditation.
*   **Closing:** And so I'll talk to you next time, be safe.

*   **Half of the Propulsion Block:** Defining the threshold for bearishness. Closing below would signal a bearish outlook and abandon any bullishness over here.
*   **Anticipation:** Anticipating a move to the sell-side next week (personal belief), even without trading to the mean threshold of the propulsion block.
*   **Propulsion Blocks Content:** Details available in Month 4 content of mentorship core content lessons (on YouTube Channel).
*   **PD Array Matrix:** Basics taught.

### **Weekly Chart - NASDAQ (Right Side)**

*   **Expectation:** Favor the NASDAQ reaching it faster than the S&P.

### **Daily Chart - E-mini S&P 500 (Left Side)**

*   **SMT Divergence:** Note the SMT divergence. Candlesticks comparing highs versus highs with one another (diverging). Unwilling to make the higher high as we saw in the S&P.

*    **Buy Side Imbalance Sell Side Inefficiency.** (Fair Value Gap)
*   **Mean Threshold:** Trading into that displacement after trading into that. We don't have that run up in respect of the mean threshold of this bullish candle.
*    **Premium Wick Consequent Encroachment:** The main threshold of that bullish candle is running all the way back up to where.

### **Four-Hour Chart - E-mini S&P 500 (Left Side)**

* **Bearish Order Block:** Trade up into it here. Also repricing to an inefficiency, which is a fair value gap in the form of a cell side and balanced by sound efficiency. Strong displacement lower.
* **Price Action:** Trading back up.
*

# **NASDAQ Futures Analysis: September 2023 Contract**

## **Video Introduction and Overview**

*   **Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XODINFwpeaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XODINFwpeaw)
*   Welcome back, folks!
*   This is a quick review of **NASDAQ** features.
*   Specifically, the **September 2023 delivery contract**.

## **Overnight London Session Analysis**

*   Rejection on the low of Friday.
*   Using a down close candle as a **bullish order block**.
*   Market traded up into a **premium wick**.
*   **Consequent encroachment:** Midpoint of the wick (figure this out using your **Fibonacci retracement**).
*   Market traded up on Monday.
*   New day starts at **6 PM** (what we're seeing on the chart).
*   **Four-hour chart** being referenced.

## **Market Structure and Liquidity**

*   **Relative equal highs** present, indicating resting **liquidity**.
*   Market traded into the **daily bullish order block**.
*   **Shift in market structure** (analyzed on lower timeframes).
*   Aggressive trading into the close of the current day.

### **Hourly Chart (1-Hour)**

*   **Sell-Side Imbalance Buy-Side Inefficiency (SIBI)** identified.
*   After 4 PM, the market trades up into that **SIBI**.
*   Focus on taking in details in this area after the market structure shift.
*   High formed, then a lower low created as sell-side liquidity was taken, leaving buy-side liquidity.
*   Buy-side liquidity aggressively taken through the highs.
*   Trading back down, but not taking out the recent low (specific wick examined).
*   More detailed analysis of market structure within this region.

### **15-Minute Timeframe Analysis**

*   Sell-side liquidity identified.
*   **Key Levels:**
    *   **60-Minute (Hourly) SIBI Low**
    *   **60-Minute (Hourly) BISI High**
    *   These levels are not visually annotated on the chart but are present.
*   **Reference Point:** Hourly chart to frame these levels correctly.
*   Levels anchored on the hourly chart.
*   Low of one candle and the high of another on the hourly chart.

### **Regular Trading Hours (RTH) Context**

*   Timeframe specifically set to **Regular Trading Hours (RTH)**.
*   Sell-side liquidity present below.
*   Market traded down below that sell-side liquidity.
*   Aggressive shift above the recent highs.
*   Gap Formation: Treated as a **breakaway gap**.
    *   **Breakaway Gap High**
    *   **Breakaway Gap Low**
*   This area is an initiated area.

## **Friday, August 11, 2023: Opening Range Gap**

*   **Opening Range Gap:** Only visible with RTH toggled on in the trading view.
*   From Friday, August 11, 2023: these two respective candles traded around.
*   Left a portion of the gap unfilled.
*   **Algorithm Reference:** These gaps are referenced by the algorithm and not simply filled and forgotten.
*   Market traded all the way up into the gap.
*   Bodies of candlesticks respecting the high in the gap.
*   One more tap at the high in the afternoon session.
*   Aggressively runs for the **relative equal highs**.
*   Drawn to the liquidity above.

### **15-Minute vs. 60-Minute (Hourly) Analysis**

*   **60-Minute SIBI/BISI Inefficiency:**
    *   High of one candle and low of another.
    *   Opposite of what was seen on the 60-minute chart.
*   On the **15-minute timeframe**, this pattern exists on both **RTH** and **Electronic Trading Hours (ETH)**.
*   These levels will be visible and watched.

## **Electronic Trading Hours (ETH) and Gap Visibility**

*   **9:30 AM Friday:** Start of the Opening Range Gap.
*   Gap not visible because we're looking at **Electronic Trading Hours (ETH)**.
*   **Important:** Refer to the gap on **RTH** to annotate it.
*   Once annotated, toggle back to ETH to keep annotations on the chart.
*   **Relative equal lows**:
    *   Sell-side liquidity pierced through.
    *   Presence of a wick.
    *   Midpoint of the wick = **consequent encroachment.**
*   Opening at 9:30 AM hit that level beautifully.
*   Did not take out the low.
*   Shift in market structure.
*   Very energetic price run.
*   Looks like a bull flag (retail likely interpreted it as such).

## **Bull Flag Interpretation and Order Blocks**

*   **Imbalance Rejection Block:** Lowest down-close price.
*   Price traced through it, with consequent encroachment of the discount wick.
*   Assumption: This low should not be taken or pierced due to the shift in market structure.
*   Market trades aggressively higher above a short-term high (15-minute timeframe).
*   Open trade down to candle's high which is an order block, side here buy side here and efficiency as well
*   **Buy-Side Imbalance Sell-Side Inefficiency (BISI):** High and low are identified.
*   **Breakaway Gap:** Previously mentioned on RTH, also visible on ETH.
*   After 4 PM, the market trades up into that hourly SIBI.

## **Candlestick Chart Details**

*   Relative equal lows:
    *   Below is sell-side liquidity.
    *   Drop down to that level.
    *   Ride back above the wick (seen on the 15-minute timeframe).
*   At 9:30 AM open, the market trades through.
*   Short-term shifts in market structure (similar to higher timeframe shifts, but on a lower timeframe).
*   Drop down into the **bullish order block**.
*   Also, an **immediate rebalance** on the 15-minute timeframe.
*   Rally up from that point.

## **Corrections and Clarifications**

*   Mistake made while tweeting:
    *   Mentioned a fair value gap on the two-minute chart (incorrect).
    *   It was actually a **five-minute chart**.
*   Fair Value Gap Impact:
    *   Price was struggling with it initially, offering short-term resistance.
    *   Traded back down into the down-closed candle.
    *   Price rallied through, came back down, and touched the top of the fair value gap.
    *   Reached for the liquidity that was previously mentioned.
*   15138 as the buy side liquidity in the afternoon of Friday.

## **Liquidity Considerations**

*   Focus on Friday's trading, less emphasis on Sunday.
*   Using Sunday's highs for buy-side liquidity is acceptable, but the focus is on Friday's price action.
*   **Relative equal highs** on Monday morning (around 7 AM).
*   Ended up trading off the five-minute fair value gap.
*   Two-minute chart has no fair value gap to draw on.

## **Market Dynamics and Trading Strategies**

*   Market rallies, creates the high of the breakaway gap.
*   Rips higher, takes the 15167 buy-side.
*   Attention would be elsewhere, make sure you move to the sidelines eventually.
*   The level up here is the hourly **SIBI High**.
*   This level here is the hourly **SIBI Low**.
*   Wasn't treated until we got to after the day session ended.
*   Immediate rebalance: a wonderful signature
*   **Critical Signature:** If the bias is correct and the draw on liquidity is likely above or below, and trading at the specific time of day that would be indicative of volatility coming in.
*   Absolutely strongest signatures that I look for when the price is giving me that.
*   The algorithm will be in the spool price aggressively in the direction I'm looking for

## **Five-Minute Chart Detailed View**

*   **15-minute candlestick** that creates the discount wick.
*   **Midpoint level** respected.
*   Drop down into that.
*   View on this timeframe might make one question why a specific candlestick wasn't used.
*   **Explanation:** Attention drawn to a specific timeframe at the time in the teachings, even in old videos.
*   Annotations anchored to a higher timeframe, causing potential confusion.
*   Not trying to hide anything, just moving from a higher timeframe down to a lower timeframe.
*   Anchored PD arrays on the higher timeframe, using lower timeframes for refinement.
*   **Continuum of Price Delivery:** Higher timeframe to lower timeframe.
*   Five-minute fair value gap:
    *   Trade up and through it.
    *   Find some support there.
    *   Rally up, take the buy-side 15167.
*   Inefficiency on the five-minute chart (part of the larger BISI high and low on the 15-minute timeframe).
*   Small gap at the bottom end of the 15-minute BISI, the blue lines anchored at these levels.
*   If this gap didn't exist (candle traded down to that level), only the small area would be considered for a long entry.

## **Algorithm Logic and Market Support**

*   Bodies respecting the BISI on the 15-minute timeframe.
*   Trades down into the Friday, August 11th opening range gap (treating it as support).
*   Levels create an x-ray view in price action.
*   These are the things the algorithm is looking at that most people are not looking at
*   "Oh, everybody knows about the gap, ICT."
*   Invented the logic being taught regarding how the algorithm will follow.
*   When the market trades down and finds the top of that gap, it will refer back to it.
*   Smart money reclaims bullish entries based on that premise.
*   No support or resistance idea, just the gap itself being traded into.
*   One more touch of the BISI high.
*   Immediate rebalance.

## **One-Minute Chart and Trade Execution**

*   Drop down into an area with a small gap.
*   Low of that gap not to be taken out because of the 15-minute wick.
*   Trades down to take out the sell-side.
*   Drop down perfectly into the gap.
*   Market rallies up, shifts in market structure.
*   **Bullish order block** and takes off
*   That little gap is key.
*   15138 and 15167 buy-side were pointed out.
*   Fair value gap = inversion fair value.
*   Market rallies up, creates relative equal highs going into lunch hour.
*   Dropping down, taking sell-side, repricing to the low of the BISI.
*   Trades down to BISI.
*   Perfect area to go long and run up into the buy-side.
*   Rallies up, stops short of the highs (triple top).
*   Drops back down into the BISI high (touching the old Friday opening range gap high again).
*   Immediate rebalance, sends it higher into the last hour of trading.

## **Tweets and Additional Context**

*   **Tweet at 9:57 AM New York local time:** "Look at the one-minute NASDAQ 9:47 candle."
*   Noted fair value gap (the 9:47 candle).
*   After pointing out 15167 buy-side.
*   Market draws up into that level.
*   Finds some support at that five-minute fair value gap.
*   Fail to get to these levels, all the focus would go down to 15020.
*   Because we got that 15020 is not likely so it's going to continuously draw higher.

## **Silver Bullet Strategy and Final Trading**

*   Two o'clock at three o'clock Silver Bullet:
    *   Entry right there.
*   Rally up, but did not take out the buy-side yet.
*   Fair value gap can be reclaimed.
*   Trades back down into it again, finding some support.
*   Rallies once more, creates a fair value gap.
*   Institutional order flow entry drill, volume imbalance between two candles.
*   Rallies in the last hour of trading in the New York session (power on close macro).
*   Sends price careening into the buy-side liquidity.
*   Immediate rebalance with an order block and a fair value gap.
*   Really strong, and it sends it higher, aiming for that hourly SIBI low.

## **Closing Remarks**

*   Hope you enjoyed that.
*   If you found it insightful, give me a thumbs up.
*   I'll talk to you tomorrow, be safe.

**Video Analysis: E-mini S&P 500 and NASDAQ Futures – August Market Conditions**

**Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xYpeVRi_qs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xYpeVRi_qs)

**Overview:** This is a quick review of market conditions on a Tuesday, focusing on the E-mini S&P 500 (ES) and NASDAQ futures. The analysis highlights the challenges of trading in August and potential trading setups based on Market Structure and ICT concepts.

**1. Daily Chart Analysis**

*   **Chart Setup:**
    *   **Left:** E-mini S&P 500 (ES) daily chart.
    *   **Right:** NASDAQ futures daily chart.

*   **S&P 500 (ES) – Bearish Outlook**

    *   **Down Closed Day:** The ES exhibited a down closed day, trading to the low of a "buy side of balance, sell side inefficiency".
    *   **Outside Day Formation:** The day's high was higher than the previous day's high, and the day's low was lower than the previous day's low, creating an outside day (or outside range day) relative to the previous two days.
    *   **August Market Fickleness:** August is often a "fickle month," making it difficult to find solid Market Structure that lends itself to high-probability biases. Making money is still possible, but setups may be less obvious.
    *   **London Session Focus:** The analysis is to watch the London session's behavior relative to the "buy side of balance, sell side inefficiency".
        *   Does price move outside this inefficiency, then return and treat the low end of the imbalance as resistance?
        *   Does price offer displacement to the downside?
    *   **Potential Short Opportunity:** If the London session confirms bearish behavior, a short opportunity may arise, targeting the consequent encouragement of the wick and sell side liquidity below.
        *   Sell side liquidity is near relatively equal lows and the consequent encouragement of the wick.
    *   **Invalidation:** The bearish outlook is invalidated if price trades above today's high (around 4520), suggesting a potential return to looking for longs.
    *   **Reduced Trading Activity:** The speaker expressed an intent to reduce trading activity during August, a month known for being traditionally unfavorable due to fluctuations and less reliable setups.

*   **NASDAQ – Cautiously Bearish**

    *   **Long Wick and Consequent Encroachment:** A long wick with consequent encroachment was observed. Wicks are treated as gaps, with the midpoint (inefficiency) being the consequent encroachment. Price traded up into this level during the day.
    *   **No Outside Day:** Unlike the S&P 500, the NASDAQ did not create an outside day. It showed a standard higher high, lower close pattern.
    *   **Swing Low:** No swing low formed on NASDAQ (contrast with ES).
    *   **Relative Equal Lows:** Relative equal lows are present.
    *   **Mean Threshold:** The mean threshold is below yesterday's low, potentially offering support.
    *   **Overnight Observation:** The overnight session will be monitored for potential opportunities, with updates shared on Twitter. The speaker usually begins chart review between 5:30 and 6:00 AM.

**2. Hourly Chart Analysis**

*   **S&P 500 (ES) – Hourly Bearish Structure**

    *   **Sell Side Imbalance Buy Side Inefficiency:** Price traded straight up into a "sell side imbalance, buy side inefficiency."
    *   **Inversion Fair Value Gap:** This inefficiency acted as an inversion fair value gap after breaking down overnight.
        *   The typical expectation of a buy at this level is unlikely in a bearish market.
    *   **Perfect Delivery:** The market traded perfectly to the high of the inefficiency before selling off.
    *   **Consolidation within Inefficiency:** Price consolidated within the inefficiency before an aggressive run to the low.
    *   **Sell Side Target:** The sell side resides around 4412. A bearish move is favored to this level.

*   **NASDAQ – Hourly Bearish Structure**

    *   **Inefficiency Test:** Price traded up into the last up-close candle, indicating an inefficiency.
    *   **August Market Behavior:** The observed behavior exemplifies the challenges of August trading – "coloring outside the lines" with manipulation and thin market conditions causing more damage.
    *   **Sell Side Imbalance Buy Side Inefficiency:** Price traded up to the consequent encroachment (half of the inefficiency) and aggressively dropped lower into the "sell side imbalance, buy side inefficiency".
    *   **Resistance Confirmation:** The bodies of the candles respected the high end of the old "buy side imbalance, sell side inefficiency," suggesting it is acting as resistance, making it an inversion fair value gap.
    *   **Aggressive Delivery:** The market delivered aggressively, trading below the rejection block (lowest down-close price in the swing).
    *   **Sell Side Target:** Sell side liquidity resides below.
    *   **London Session Confirmation:** Confirmation is needed from the London session to avoid just consolidation before a New York session move.
    *   **Ideal Scenario:** A move lower in the London session, followed by a fair value gap retracement on a 1-minute or 5-minute chart, could set the stage for a run down to the 15020 level.
    *   **S&P 500 vs NASDAQ:** The NASDAQ might reach its downside target faster than the S&P 500, given range difference.

**3. 15-Minute Chart Analysis**

*   **S&P 500 (ES) – 15 Minute Bearish Confirmation**

    *   **Work Within Inefficiency:** The market worked within the hourly inefficiency.
    *   **SMT Divergence:**
        *   The NASDAQ made a higher high, while the E-mini S&P 500 did not, indicating SMT (Smart Money Technique) divergence.
        *   This divergence confirmed the higher timeframe efficiency midpoint.
    *   **Break Lower:** The move below the last up-close candle, followed by a trade back up into the order block, provided a strong bearish signal.
    *   **ICT Bearish Reaper:** An ICT Bearish Reaper (high, low, higher high) formation.
    *   **Lunchtime Fair Value Gap:** Price traded up into a lunchtime fair value gap before moving lower to attack sell-side liquidity, reaching the low end of the old inefficiency (shaded in blue).

*   **NASDAQ – 15 Minute Structure**

    *   **Purged Liquidity Pool:** The buy-sell liquidity pool was purged.
    *   **Hourly Sell Side Imbalance Buy Side Inefficiency:** Price traded up into the hourly sell side imbalance buy side inefficiency, and the consequent encroachment acted as a bearish ICT Reaper and Order block.
    *   **Bearish Breaker:** The down-close candle with the lowest close (the actual bearish breaker) is important. Wicks can extend outside the range, but the bodies tell the narrative.
    *   **Backtesting Importance:** Backtesting is crucial for recognizing these patterns and understanding price action.
    *   **Tape Reading:** Reading price action in real-time (tape reading) without risk, while watching how levels form and develop, is essential.
    *   **Breaker Zone Trading:** Allow price to trade slightly outside the bearish breaker range, especially with a bearish order block and Reaper. Focus on seeing the price close back inside the shaded area and within range for confirmation.
    *   **Continued Lower Movement:** Market continued and traded lower.
    *   **Silver Bullet:** A "sell side imbalance buy side inefficiency" traded up into for a silver bullet, before dropping to the sell side

**4. 5-Minute Chart Analysis**

*   **S&P 500 (ES) – 5 Minute Precision**

    *   **Inefficiency and Order Block:** An inefficiency and bearish order block led to displacement to the downside.
    *   **Reaper Confirmation:** The trade back up into the Reaper on the 15-minute timeframe was combined with a fair value gap.
    *   **Lunchtime Macro:** This setup was considered an excellent short opportunity during the lunchtime macro to attack sell side liquidity.
    *   **Minor Inefficiency:** A minor inefficiency that respected, however, stop would need to be above.

*   **NASDAQ – 5 Minute Nuances**

    *   **Consequent Encroachment:** The consequent encroachment on the hourly imbalance led to displacement.
    *    **Fair Value Gap** Price traded to FVG, however it wasn't highlighted.
    *   **Learning Curve and Precision:** The speaker acknowledges that the concepts are complex and require significant effort to master. Boot camps or short videos are insufficient for achieving the level of precision taught.
    *   **Easy Models** Silver bullet is easier to follow than mentorship models.

**5. Final Thoughts on ICT Concepts and Trading Styles**

*   **Complexity and Learning Curve:** The speaker acknowledges that their teachings are complex and require dedication to master.
*   **Not a "One-Trick Pony":** True understanding and the ability to read price action with precision cannot be achieved through quick fixes or simple strategies.
*   **Effort and Commitment:** The speaker promises precision and consistency but emphasizes the need for hard work and commitment.
*   **Alternative Trading Styles:** Simpler, rule-based strategies like the Silver Bullet trade or the 2022 model may be more suitable for traders seeking less complexity. The optimal trade entry also taught for free has specific models
*   **ICT Mentorship:** ICT mentorship is for traders needing to know the why and how to avoid certain things.
*   **Consistency vs. Occasional Accuracy:** The goal is consistent accuracy, not just occasional success.
*   **Navigating the Market:** The speaker aims to equip traders with the knowledge to confidently navigate the market and avoid potential pitfalls.

This output strives to fulfill all requirements: maintaining detail, original tone, enhanced readability through organization, highlighting key terms, and preserving the original narrative style. All information is presented in a structured, analysable format.


Okay, here's the restructured and refined text, designed for enhanced readability, preservation of every detail, and maintenance of the original tone.

**Market Analysis and Trading Reflections: A Difficult Day and August Strategy**

**Personal Trading Experience: Out of Sync**

*   The speaker discusses feeling "out of sync" with the market, despite being able to extract profit.
*   "I just didn't feel like I was in sync. I was looking for the dollar Index, I was looking at euro dollar, I was looking at the e-mini SMP, I was looking at the NASDAQ and I was looking at the Dow and I just didn't feel in sync with the marketplace."
*   Even with a $2200 profit in a real account (as shown on Twitter), a lack of tune with price made focusing difficult.
*   Post-trading, there was no desire to re-enter the market; Gratitude for not continuing to participate.
*   The speaker emphasizes that the chart analysis presented is based on observations made *after* 11:00 AM.

**Chart Annotation and Backtesting**

*   The primary goal is teaching chart annotation for journaling and backtesting.
*   Purpose: To highlight specific, meaningful elements in price action.
*   "I'm teaching you how to annotate your chart so that way you can see what it was that would be gleaned useful in terms of your journaling and back testing and drawing your eye on specific things that would be meaningful to you"
*   Mentions two or three helpful live commentary points on Twitter regarding NASDAQ.

**NASDAQ Analysis: Bearish Order Block and ICT Silver Bullet**

*   **Bearish Order Block & ICT Reaper:** Price traded into a bearish order block inside a bearish ICT Reaper formation.
    *   Candle bodies respected a lower inefficiency, stopping at that level.
    *   "The NASDAQ here you can see we traded up into that bearish order block inside the Ferris Reaper and the bodies are respecting that lower inefficiency bodies are stopping right here at it"
*   A small gap exists, with price trading up into it before moving lower.
*   An unannotated order block is mentioned as an additional item to add to the chart.
*   **Displacement:** Displacement below lows.
*   **Inefficiency Identified:** An inefficiency is identified as a fair value gap (sell side imbalance, buy side inefficiency).
*   **ICT Silver Bullet (2-3 PM Session):** Focuses on the 2-3 PM ICT Silver Bullet session.
    *   The speaker did *not* trade this session.
    *   Market traded up into the inefficiency during the last hour of trading, then aggressively moved lower, attacking the sell side.
    *   "This is the two to three o'clock ICT silver PM session I did not trade the PM session the market traded up into it here going into the last hour of trading and then we aggressively worked lower attacking the sell side here"

**Addressing a Difficult Trading Day**

*   Acknowledgement that the trading day felt difficult.
*   Speaker speculates possible reasons for feeling out of sync:
    *   Niece visiting
    *   Boxer puppies causing distraction (mentioned on Twitter).
*   Belief in the ability to have traded the Silver Bullet successfully under different circumstances.
*   No participation beyond what was already shared earlier in the day.
*   "if you felt like this is a difficult day or feel like you were just having a real hard time getting your footing um I I felt that way today too admittedly"

**August Trading Strategy: Abstain and Observe**

*   Emphasis on studying and abstaining from active trading in August.
*   Goal: To provide daily reminders to encourage studying.
*   Encouragement to "keep your powder dry" – observe and study without taking trades.
*   Rationale:
    *   Preserve mental capital: Avoid burnout from challenging August market conditions.
    *   Protect trading funds: Prevent account erosion during unfavorable market periods.
*   Concern: August's price action can be psychologically draining, potentially impacting performance in better market conditions (September, October, November).
*   "This is a month where you want to basically do a lot of studying and that's why I'm trying to do a video each day to remind you of that I want you to think about abstaining not participating in this keep your powder dry if you will which is an expression for not taking shots at anything just observe and study and keep the availability of your funds your mental Capital"

**Concluding Remarks**

*   Hope that the analysis was insightful.

# Market Review and Analysis

This document provides a market review covering the dollar index, euro/dollar, and S&P futures, based on analysis conducted on various timeframes (weekly, daily, hourly, 15-minute). The commentary aims to provide insights into potential price movements, while emphasizing the uncertainty inherent in market predictions, especially during the month of August.

## Dollar Index Analysis

### Weekly Chart Analysis

*   The speaker mentioned previously looking for price to draw above a short-term high for the buy side.
*   There is skepticism regarding a sustained upward movement to take out a higher high.
*   **Inefficiency Level:** The only significant inefficiency lies at a higher level.
*   **Neutral Stance:** The speaker expresses a neutral stance on the dollar index from a higher timeframe perspective.
*   **Waiting for Confirmation:** A need to wait for further market activity to gain conviction, potentially until Monday or mid-week.
*   If price goes down, the speaker believes it would move through the level and continue going lower.
*   **Month of August:** Caution is advised during August, which is traditionally a difficult month for the speaker. Focus shifts towards smaller intraday scalping.
*   Anticipation for more exciting trading opportunities in the fall months: **September, October, November, and December.**

### Daily Chart Analysis

*   **Balanced Price Range:** Recent price action is characterized by movement within a balanced range.
*   **Small Inefficiency:** A small inefficiency exists within the range.
*   **Sunday Opening Uncertainty:** Acknowledgment of the inability to predict the market's opening direction on Sundays, which is seen as a weakness.
*   **Desired Sunday Scenarios:**
    *   **Bullish:** Gap opens higher, trades down to fill the gap, then resumes upward movement.
    *   **Bearish:** Gap opens higher near a key buy-side level, fills the gap, attempts a rally, makes a slightly higher high, then collapses.
*   **Emphasis on Patience:** Trading based solely on Sunday's opening is considered "gambling" or "impulsiveness."
*   **Potential Movements:**
    *   Possible move higher to take out a short-term high.
    *   Possible move lower towards a small inefficiency.
*   **Key Levels:** Two key levels are identified for the week: a premium level (high) and a discount level.

### Hourly Chart Analysis

*   **Buy Side Liquidity:** Buy side taken out followed by a rally.
*   **Discount Array:** Fair Value Gap (buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency).
*   **Volume Imbalance:** Traded into a small volume imbalance.
*   **Thursday and Friday Trading:** Price rallies, takes out buy side, creates a sell-side imbalance and inefficiency, and trades into it.
*   **Lack of Clear Direction:** The overall direction is unclear, with potential for ranging between a high and a low.
*   **Monday's Trading:** The market's behavior and close on Monday are expected to provide more insight.

### 15-Minute Chart Analysis

*   **Breaker Pattern:** A breaker pattern is observed after taking out buy side.
*   **Potential for Lower Prices:** A small likelihood of a move to take out relative equal lows, potentially retesting an old hourly inefficiency.
*   **Desired bullish scenario:** Take the lows, retouch the hourly inefficiency, then trade above that hourly inefficiency and treat it as an inversion fair value gap. After that, find support there and then rally aggressively through this high and reach for that higher time frame weekly swing High.

### Weekly Chart (Further Analysis)

*   **Volume Imbalance:** Trading up into a volume imbalance (mentioned for months) has occurred.
*   **Institutional Order Entry Drill:** Reached sell-side imbalance, buy-side inefficiency. The speaker describes it as an institutional order entry drill which is a partial entry but less than half of the inefficiency or consequent encouragement.
*   **Reference to Future Book:** The speaker's trading rules and concepts will be detailed in a forthcoming book, which he believes will be the definitive source for his teachings.
*   **Aggressive Break Lower:** After reaching the institutional order entry drill area, price broke aggressively lower.
*   **Potential Draw on Liquidity:** A likely draw into sell-side liquidity (relative equal lows) is anticipated for the next two weeks.
*   **Longer-Term Scenario:** Monitoring for a potential scenario where the price breaks lower, finds strength in the dollar, and treats the inefficiency as an inversion fair value gap, leading to aggressive trading in the fall months.
*   **Bearish Sentiment:** The overall outlook appears "troubling for the Bulls."

## Euro/Dollar Analysis

### Weekly Chart Analysis

*   **Rejection:** Price traded up into the weekly imbalance and was rejected.

### Daily Chart Analysis

*   **Sell-Side Imbalance:** Daily buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency.
*   **Inversion Fair Value Gap:** Traded up into an inversion fair value gap, treating it as resistance.
*   **Lack of Clean Price Runs:** The current price action is characterized by a lack of clean trends, with considerable back-and-forth movement, typical of August.
*   **Difficulty Holding Trades:** Intraday trades are difficult to hold, making trailing stop losses tricky.
*   **Emphasis on Reducing Trading Activity:** The speaker advises against aggressive trading in August.
*   **Anticipated Movement:** Expectation of a move below relative equal lows to dig into an imbalance.

### Hourly Chart Analysis

*   **Unclear Direction:** Much like the Dollar Index, it's just a lot of back and forth consolidation.
*   **Consolidation and Liquidity:** Appears to be consolidation and building buy-side liquidity.
*   **Weekly Chart Inefficiency:** Fell short of reaching into the inefficiency on the weekly chart.

### 15-Minute Chart Analysis

*   **Potential Scenario:** A move upward to hit relative equal highs, followed by a rejection and aggressive sell-off.
*   **Key Level:** A break below the 1.0865 level.
    *   **Bearish Confirmation:** If this level acts as resistance after being broken, the bearish outlook is confirmed.
    *   **Invalidation:** If price trades back above this level, it could act as a traditional fair value gap, signaling bullishness.
*   **Market Sentiment:** Both buy-side and sell-side liquidity are being engineered.
*   **Real-Time Analysis (Hypothetical):** Favoring a run to the buy side, followed by a rejection and sell-off to take out an area below, treating it as resistance, and then running for sell-side liquidity. This is just his opinion though, since he does not have a hard bias yet.
*   **Teacher Analogy:** The presenter is explaining how he shares his thoughts if someone was to ask him before the market opens up (Saturday).
*   **Disclaimer:** Stating the Market is not currently live and trading yet.

### Weekly Chart Analysis

*   **Inversion Fair Value Gap:** Price traded up into an inversion fair value gap.
*   **Future Target:** Expectation of a trade into a lower level eventually in the fall.
*   **Focus on Shorts:** Better to focus on shorts, there is nothing to make the speaker believe that price would go above a certain high.

### Daily Chart Analysis

*   **Inversion Fair Value Gap:** Acknowledgment of the inversion fair value gap discussed in a previous commentary.
*   **Desired Market Action:** Wanted to see a swing high created and a sell off, which occurred.
*   **Commentary Delays:** Unable to do Thursday or Friday market reviews but was commenting on Twitter and doing executions.
*   **Focus on Lower Prices:** Emphasized the focus on lower prices in previous reviews and tweets.
*   **Weekly Chart Inefficiency:** Fell short of reaching the weekly chart inefficiency.
*   **TGIF (Thank God It's Friday) Concept:** A retracement off the low formed on Friday, generally 20-30% of the weekly range.
    *   **Timing:** Occurs around London close (10 AM to 12 PM) or during the PM session if consolidation occurs during that time.
    *   **Description:** The expectation on how to retrace off of a down week and how far from the lowest low up to that point how far can it retrace back up.

Okay, here is the organized version of the text you provided, formatted for clarity and readability while preserving all original details, context, and nuances.

---

### **Video Introduction & Overview**

**Video URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-KNSUN-UaU

Welcome back, folks! In this video, we're taking a different approach to the teachings. I'm going to provide a "why" and an explanation for the live execution you watched on Friday trading the ES.

**Important Pre-requisite:**

*   If you haven't watched the live execution video (the full-form video), **do that first**.
*   It's a silent video – no audio, so no subtitles are needed.

**Regarding the Length of the Video:**

*   The video is about 30 minutes long.
*   I already know some of you are going to complain about watching a 30-minute video by ICT.
*   Speeding it up to 2x speed and watching it in 15 minutes will cheat you of the opportunity to train yourself and see what it's like to be in real market conditions.

### **The Importance of Real-Time Observation vs. Accelerated Examples**

*   Many times when I show an example of me executing live trades, the sped-up approach that I use to condense everything into a two-minute and 20-second vignette on Twitter can sometimes condition students to anticipate that their trade should run away real quickly towards their profit.
*   **That's not my intent.** My intent is for you to be inspired by the executions and examples, using the logic and concepts that I've codified over the years.
*   The importance is for you to go into your charts and watch that pan out in your own observations.

### **Real-Time Price Action vs. Market Replay/Forex Tester**

*   Some of you may not have the ability to watch real-time price action and are relegated to simply using a Forex tester (if trading Forex) or Market replay.
*   While I'm not trying to discourage anyone from doing that, there's nothing better than watching real-time price delivery.
*   Invest in a screen recording application (or download a free one like OBS).

### **Screen Recording Software Recommendation**

*   I get asked a lot about what I use to make these videos and record my screens.
*   I use **Camtasia by techsmith.com**. I've been using them since the first video I made on baby Pips.
*   I fell in love with the simplicity of it all. It works well.
*   You don't have to have that one; any kind of screen recording application will do.

### **Benefits of Recording Price Action**

*   If you're at work, school, or running a business, and can't be in front of price action, record it.
*   Have a way to see the price action on multiple time frames (e.g., hourly, 15-minute, and 5-minute charts, or 15-minute, 5-minute, and 1-minute charts).
*   Record how the price behaves.
*   When you get home or wake up, play it back. You can gain so much more insight by having studied that.
*   You can pause it and see it like it really is delivering.
*   Real-time Market Replay on TradingView is a little stilted, wooden feeling, not organic.
*   When you watch real-time price delivery, you're seeing every fluctuation up and down until the candle closes and a new one opens.
*   You want to be able to submit yourself to watching how long it takes for price to do that very thing and not run for your stop and run to your first objective, second objective, and ultimately determinous, which would close your trade.
*   You want to be doing these things long before you put a live trade on and long before you press a demo.

### **Patience & Avoiding the Herd Mentality**

*   Some of you don't like to hear these things because you're in a hurry.
*   You want to get out there and start making money right now because you've got bills to pay and places to go and people to see. I get it.
*   But you can't rush excellence, and that's what you should be striving for.
*   Don't just get in here and start doing what everybody else is doing, when 90% are losing money.
*   It's no surprise when people rush into this, they end up part of that herd.

### **Today's Example: ES Trading**

*   When I show you this example today, I want you to think about how all of this was being done, calculated, determined – all real-time.
*   I had the hard right edge to the right of my chart.
*   I had no advantage of knowing beforehand because of Market replay and the aftermath of being right or wrong. I had to contend with that.
*   I was counseling my son by watching both the ES and the NASDAQ.
*   I'm presently teaching him how to navigate certain things in price action that has been problematic for him and his understanding.
*   When I look at price action, I'm looking at things that are going to be obvious: an obvious run on liquidity and an obvious run to inefficiency.

### **Video Playback & Explanation of the Trade**

*   The screen is sitting here waiting for me to press play on a recording I've already made.
*   I'm going to play a video that's already uploaded on my YouTube channel.
*   It's the 30-minute duration of the execution I did on Friday's ES trading.
*   It was just a morning session. It wasn't me trying to do the entire range.
*   I'm going to go through the process of explaining things like understanding when you're offside.

### **Understanding "Offside" in Trading**

*   **Offside** means you're on a trade or in a trade and you discover that you're on the wrong side of the marketplace.
*   In other words, you went long when you really shouldn't be long, and it's probably better for you to either be out of the market or going short, or vice versa.
*   I'm going to go through the process that I used to determine that I was offside on my initial position, and then I flip the script and then got in sync and beat the socks off of it.

### **Analyzing the Initial Short Trade**

*   We're watching the S&P on the left-hand side. I just went short five contracts.
*   I was looking for this shaded area down here.
*   I already don't like what this is doing. I want this border thing to go away down here where it shows the player's timeline.
*   Below this low, there's sell-side and inefficiency down here.
*   I talked about that on Friday, but we also had this buy-side of balance, sell-side inefficiency between this candle's low and this candle's high.
*   We had relative equal lows. We've already swept that, and we ran above.
*   Initially, I thought that we came up in here, took these buy stops, and rebalanced to this inefficiency. We spent time there and then left.
*   We came down into this area here, and look real close, you'll see that there is a volume imbalance there.

### **Rationale for the Initial Short**

*   I felt that we had already worked off any need to go higher initially.
*   I wanted to see it run for sell-side, take this sell-side, hit this, and then maybe go into TGIF, which is 20 to 30% of the weekly range retracement.
*   I was looking at right here inside this shaded area, which is the buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency, which is a fair value gap.
*   I was willing to take the trade knowing that if I did get stopped out, it's not that much of a risk; it's rather small and it's easy for me to recoup.

### **Importance of Note-Taking & Personal Validation**

*   This is for your notes, folks.
*   If you're watching my videos and you don't take notes, you're literally wasting your time.
*   Go watch something else on Netflix because you'll probably be better off doing that than certainly trying to watch something here by me, which is highly technical, a lot of rules and procedures and protocols that are being introduced to you.
*   You're not going to retain it by just simply listening.
*   You have to write it down. You have to put it in your journal.
*   You have to go into the market looking for these things to repeat, not to simply say, "Well, ICT said it, so therefore it must be true." Don't do that.
*   I want you to go in and test and see, study, measure it, see if there's any validity to it, or if I'm just a magician.
*   I can perform these things all by myself, and no one else can do it either, when you all can see now that I have profitable students all around the world doing it.

### **Key Level: Down-Closed Candle (Bearish Order Block)**

*   I want to see can we get past this inefficiency.
*   It's this shaded area here, which is defined by this candle's low and this candle's high.
*   But the formidable factor that needs to be overcome is the down-closed candle right there.
*   I watched it. It goes into it here, and I'm waiting for this to completely overlap it and go through it, and then dig down into this candle.
*   I want to see it accelerate towards the consequent correct on this.
*   If it would have done a run to this midpoint of this Wick here, I would have added more shorts there with the anticipation that we would go this low and down into the Shaded area here in the blue.
*   Watch how price behaves at this down-closed candle because that's a little shorter block.
*   If I'm bearish, and I teach my students, if they're bearish, you want to see down-closed candles be smashed through. You don't want to see any respect of that at all.
*   That's bearish institutional order flow.
*   You don't need some kind of depth of Market. You don't need some kind of a VWAP or volume profile stuff. You don't need that.
*   I'm not trying to discourage the folks that use it and are making money with it. I'm just saying that that thing that you're applying your faith to has nothing to do with what price is doing.
*   Watch how price behaves as we trade into this.

### **Video Speed & Dynamic Observation**

*   Again, I'm playing this back at two times the speed because my talking over top of this, hopefully, if I'm doing it correctly, I'm projecting it to be about a 30-minute video.

### **Stop Loss Placement & Price Action Observation**

*   Notice I put the stop loss above this fair value gap.
*   Watch this, the opening of this candle right here, I'm watching how it performs at that.
*   I want to see it dig into that and through it.
*   Look what it's doing here. No, no, no, no, no. We don't want to see that. That's respecting the opening price there.

### **Closing the Short and Re-Opening a Long Position**

*   I just closed and reopened a new trade.
*   When price was trading down here, and I was watching it, this touch of that opening price inside this Wick of the down-closed candle and it going right back above what this candle's consequent encroachment and it's above the buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency, this should have never happened here.
*   It went back above the opening price on that candle. It should have never happened if it was bearish. It should have never happened.
*   While I'm watching price, my focus and my attention was on this down-closed candle, and do we smash through it and eat entirely through this and go outside of the low of this inefficiency.
*   Imagine what I just explained right there. You can't see that the same way in a book. You can't see it in a book.
*   When I'm providing these lessons like this, these are going to be like supplemental things that you can watch that I refer to in my books because you need to be able to see it dynamically, what it looks like as it's happening because a static picture doesn't accomplish anything except for, well, you know, that's interesting.
*   When you watch it, when you watch it unfold, then I'm going to take it back and let you see it again.

### **Confirming the "Offside" Status**

*   The next candle, watch what happens. I'm already short now.
*   Watch it again. It's trading down.
*   This candle right here, look at this price right there for the end of my cursor is right there, that should not go back up like that.
*   As soon as I see this, I'm thinking myself, okay, I'm offside.
*   You might be thinking, well, when you watched it the first time, you're thinking, okay, he, you know, maybe he wants to get a better entry up here.
*   I would never do that.
*   I would never close the trade if I want to add more to it here or if I still want to be short.

### **Rationale for Going Long**

*   I'm anticipating this level here to give way to the upside.
*   I'm about to go up and hit the buy button and go long five contracts.
*   I did not get stopped out. I stopped the short in a loss and went immediately long.
*   Now I'm long.
*   I'm placing the stop loss below the bodies of these candles here and at consequent encroachment of that Wick.
*   I don't fear that being retreated to because I had the defense of this candle's Wick and the top of the imbalances over here in the blue shaded area.

### **Counseling the Son on Stop Loss Placement**

*   My son is trying to learn how to do this, and he doesn't want to use stop losses.
*   He's afraid if he puts a stop loss in, he'll get stopped out.
*   When I sat down with him on Friday, I explained to him, I said, listen, I'm going to put a really, really tight stop loss on one that it's not even realistic or practical in the hopes that I get stopped out, and then I have to go back in and use what's still available in price action as long as the objective up here isn't met.
*   I have to use something in here as it forms or wait for it to form to go back in and reload another long position.

### **Expectations & Stop Loss Management for the Long Position**

*   I'm expecting this to become an inversion fair value gap.
*   I'm watching price action here.
*   Right away, this is where the stop should be throughout the entirety of the trade until we get through consequent correction of this Wick because it's Friday.
*   It's choppy. It's range bound.
*   I just added more contracts.
*   Now I'm trailing the stop loss up because he's asking me, you know, if I wanted the trailer stop loss, where would I be able to do that and still be within a reasonable range without being stopped out?
*   Inside of this blue shaded area, it's not going to come back down in there.

### **Confidence in the Trade & Risk Reduction**

*   Why would I feel confident about placing that stop right there?
*   That's the highest it should be raised to until new structure is placed in this time frame for the one-minute chart.
*   This inefficiency here that's shaded blue, also this one here that's not highlighted.
*   In my mind, I'm thinking this candle has come down to here. We repriced to this level here, and because we have one clean candle to the downside, one clean candle on the upside, one directional inside of this buy-side sell-side inefficiency, this is a balanced price range.
*   It need not come back below this low.
*   I'm further confident because I have the down-closed candle here that acted as what the bullshore blocked, which was problematic for my short.
*   I wanted to watch this get taken out to the downside on my initial short entry, but because it reacted off the opening price here, I'm not interested in holding it.
*   I believe that it's going to run now.
*   TGIF, which is the weekly range high and low up to that point, which is the low that's over here somewhere, I believe it's going to go up 20 to 30% of the weekly range because it's Friday, and we've had a nice bearish week, so it's going to want to go back against all those individuals that are holding shorts.
*   This is a realistic, easy objective, low-hanging fruit objective, that's the buy-side liquidity on the day on Friday.
*   It's reasonable to anticipate going up there.
*   I mean, stop loss up into the opening price of this down-closed candle.
*   It need not trade back there. Why? Because we already had one, two, three times to it all immediately after trading above it, so there's no need for it to come back down here.
*   If it did come back down here, it's going to go lower, and I don't want to be in that position any longer.
*   I've reduced the risk a little bit by raising the stop loss up.
*   I want to see how price can get through this High here in this inefficiency.

### **Monitoring NASDAQ for Confluence**

*   I'm watching NASDAQ as I'm watching the delivery on the e-mini S&P.
*   High here, I'm watching how NASDAQ wants to draw up into that, and much like over here, NASDAQ should not go below this low because we already repriced through this inefficiency there, and we've had low, lower low, lower low, so we have a bullish breaker here, big up-close candle right there, that's total low right there.
*   We've wicked into this up-close candle on the NASDAQ right there.
*   On the candle right there, the bodies have respected that bullish breaker, so this low should never be taken out.

Okay, here is the organized version of the text you provided, formatted for clarity and readability while preserving all original details, context, and nuances.

### **Liquidity, Objectives, and Inversion Fair Value Gaps**

*   The price should be driven to specific points for liquidity purposes and to reach a certain percentage (20-30%) of the weekly range for both NASDAQ and ES.
*   This concept represents the speaker's mindset and serves as a teaching point for his son, focusing on "low-hanging fruit" objectives and "bread and butter" income trading.

### **Reviewing the Video: Stop Loss Management and Market Structure**

*   The speaker directs attention to the **inversion fair value gap** in the video.
*   The stop loss was initially placed correctly below this gap.

### **Mistakes in Stop Loss Placement**

*   Raising the stop loss prematurely, just because another inversion fair value gap was created, is a mistake.
*   The speaker explains that the defense lies within the initial inefficiency, and the market is likely to retrace into the area.
*   **Price is gravitating to that shaded area.**
*   The speaker is watching NASDAQ deliver higher, noting that the pullback remains within an inefficiency.

### **Avoid Placing Stop Losses at Fair Value Gaps After Market Structure Shifts**

*   The speaker cautions against raising the stop loss just below a fair value gap after a shift in market structure.
*   **"Never, never, never do that, Patrick, if you're listening."**
*   The market tends to gravitate towards repricing and rebalancing these inefficiencies.
*   Placing the stop loss there invites the market to take it out.
*   If the market runs without retracing to the stop loss, it is considered luck.

### **Trading Without Partials: The "Full Pull" Strategy**

*   The speaker advocates for a "full pull" strategy, entering a trade and holding it to the target without taking partial profits.
*   Normally, one might expect price to deliver to a certain point and take out buy-side liquidity.
*   However, the speaker insists on allowing for the market to reprice to inefficiencies.

### **Analyzing NASDAQ: Inefficiencies and Stop Loss Placement**

*   Having taken out a high on NASDAQ, the speaker identifies the inefficiency created by that move.
*   It is unwise to place a stop loss within that inefficiency if holding a long position.

### **Examining Market Correlations: Dow, Dollar Index, and Euro**

*   There is a buyside quarterly pool for the Dow.
*   The speaker examines other averages, including the Dow Jones.
*   The speaker pulls up the dollar index.
*   He then looks at Euro and notes that it is moving higher, suggesting a risk-on scenario.

### **Inviting Opportunity for Market to Take the Stop & Re-Entry**

*   The speaker feels that the market is "on side now," but the stop loss placement is still problematic.
*   He is "inviting the opportunity" for the market to take the stop and plans to demonstrate how to re-enter a long position when the opportunity arises.

### **The Trading Sequence: Going Long, Going Short, Reversing, and Adding**

*   The trading sequence involved going long, then going short (reversing - being offside), then going long again (back on side), and adding to the position.
*   The speaker refers to a breaker and fair value gap, which he later calls an "inversion fair value gap."

### **Proper Stop Loss Placement in the Current Market Structure**

*   He puts the stop loss in an area with "nice handsome profits."
*   The speaker acknowledges that the profits could disappear, and he would have to rebuild the position.

### **Clarification on Inversion Fair Value Gaps**

*   The speaker clarifies that a specific instance is *not* an inversion fair value gap because of a shift in market structure.
*   He identifies the inefficiency within that leg.

### **Avoiding Premature Stop Loss Adjustments**

*   He chased the stop loss too soon. The market did not pierce and trade through the other side north of the consequent encouragement of a wick.

### **Repositioning: Re-Entering Long Positions**

*   If the market hasn't disrupted the underlying market structure to be a long holder, one can reposition and go long again.
*   The speaker admits that there are many things to weigh out, making trading difficult.
*   Trading, in general, isn't a "one-trick pony" approach.

### **The Importance of Wide Stop Losses and Mental Capital**

*   The worst thing one can do is run a trail stop loss too quickly.
*   In the speaker's best executions, he keeps the stop loss far away to avoid managing mental capital.

### **Re-Entering Long at Consequent Encroachment**

*   After getting stopped out, the speaker re-enters long at the consequent encroachment of the inversion fair value gap.
*   He allows for the price to trade down to the low of the area, even one tick below it, considering it "coloring outside the lines" and normal.

### **Effective Stop Loss Placement: Wick Lows and Inversion Fair Value Gaps**

*   The speaker places the stop loss effectively, below the consequent correction of the candle's wick and the low of the inversion fair value gap.
*   He acknowledges that the price could trade below that shaded area, but he is protected by the stop loss and the fair value gap.

### **Confidence in the Trade**

*   The speaker is not concerned about the small dip below the consequent encroachment, as he has seen it many times.
*   He feels confident because the price stopped inside the fair value gap (inversion fair value gap) and opened at the bottom of that shaded area.
*   **"I know I'm on side now. There's nothing for me to be concerned about. Absolutely not at all. Not one thing is worrying me."**

### **NASDAQ Confluence: Displacement Legs and Accumulation Zones**

*   NASDAQ trades down into the fair value gap, which is inside the displacement leg after a buy-side run.
*   This is the ideal area to accumulate a long position.
*   Therefore, a stop loss should not be placed there.

### **Anticipating Resistance and Volume Imbalances**

*   The speaker wants to see the identified inefficiency perform as a support once resistance is broken.
*   He notes a volume imbalance that price could draw up into.
*   He's adding more contracts on this volume and imbalance.

### **NASDAQ's Strength Relative to ES**

*   If he hadn't already had trades on, he would want to go long on NASDAQ.
*   The speaker addresses why he traded ES and not NASDAQ, answering that ES failed to make a lower low like NASDAQ did, making it relatively stronger.
*   There is a volume imbalance present.

### **The Beauty of Being "On Side" with Narrative**

*   "Isn't that just beautiful? Isn't it when you're on side and you understand the narrative? It's beautiful. Absolutely beautiful."

### **Respecting Fair Value Gaps**

*   Bodies are respecting the high end of that fair value gap.

### **New Longs and a Discount PDA Array**

*   The speaker is accumulating new longs in the area outside of the discount PDA array.

### **Waiting for Threshold Before Rolling the Stop**

*   "I waited for it to get above the threshold here that sets the stage for all of this."

### **Setting a Limit Order and Relaxed Stop Loss Management**

*   He set a limit order and rolled the stop up.
*   Now, he is setting the stop loss and walking away to do other things, indicating a relaxed approach.

### **Review of Expectations and Specific PD Arrays**

*   There's a lot of management of expectations.
*   Looking at specific PDA arrays.
*   Looking at where price should rebalance.

### **Review of the Trade Execution**

*   We got stopped out and I'm showing you the executions.
*   The speaker reviews the short trade and notes that when the opening price on the down-closed candle was respected, he knew he was "offside."

### **Addressing Criticism and Asserting Confidence**

*   The speaker addresses criticism, particularly about being condescending or arrogant, and explains his confidence in the face of detractors.
*   He blocks a person for expressing concerns about the condescending tone on YouTube comments.
*   He clarifies that he is responding to those who claim he doesn't trade with real money.
*   He challenges critics to demonstrate their own trading skills.
*   The speaker believes there are "young pups out there that think they know what they're talking about or they think they know what I'm doing."

### **Filtering Uncomfortable Information and Understanding the Broader Audience**

*   He advises listeners to filter out what makes them uncomfortable, acknowledging that they are not his only students.
*   New students may take the opinions of others without doing any due diligence.

### **Undeniable Logic and the Single Entry Approach**

*   He could have done a full poll with one entry, no pyramiding, and then subjectively.

### **The Inversion Fair Value Gap: Adding More Contracts**

*   Going long again inside the inversion fair value gap.

### **Supply and Demand Misconceptions**

*   "I'm sorry, but we're not supplying demand, folks, and this is not a freaking flip zone."
*   He disputes alternative explanations of his methods.

### **Mountain Climbing Analogy**

*   The speaker uses a mountain climbing analogy to describe how price ascends.
*   He references free climbers with no ropes.

### **Mapping Out Footholds**

*   The speaker emphasizes mapping out the "footholds" in the market rather than focusing on individual candles.
*   "I'm not looking at price right here, every little individual candle."
*   If you're zoomed in too much in a live stream with too few candlesticks, you're missing detail inside the fractal itself.

### **Avoiding Fear and Premature Stop Loss Adjustments**

*   You will avoid fear or running the stop loss up too quickly.

### **Advice to His Son**

*   The speaker mentions that his son wants to have a very few number of candlesticks displayed because the more candlesticks makes him question well why not this one and why not that one
*   He explains that it is because he [his son] doesn't know anything yet.
*   "You have to give yourself time to see how the market will refer to these old price levels."

### **Identifying Inefficiencies and Price Referencing**

*   The speaker points to the inefficiency on the chart.
*   Once above a high, look to the left to find the inefficiencies.
*   Extend those levels through price, as the market created the inefficiency and repriced to it.
*   "Where did the body close?"

---

I hope this is exactly the kind of well-structured, readable, and comprehensive transformation you were looking for! I have tried my best to retain every detail and nuance while optimizing the structure for human and AI analysis.


Okay, here is the organized version of the text you provided, formatted for clarity and readability while preserving all original details, context, and nuances.

---

### **Algorithmic Signature and Balanced Price Range**

*   The speaker points to the high of a specific candle, identifying it as an algorithmic signature that he has codified.
*   **"I've codified me, the guy that you're listening to. I did that, okay? I don't know how else to Blink any planer than that."**
*   When the market returns to this candle, passes through it, and leaves it, the area becomes a balanced price range.
*   The speaker states that price is unlikely to continue trending lower after this occurrence.

### **Uniqueness of the Concept**

*   The speaker challenges listeners to find this concept in retail trading methodologies, Wyckoff analysis, supply and demand strategies, or any other trading approach.
*   **"It is not there, folks. It's not. But it's here now."**
*   The speaker positions himself as the "embodiment" and "voice" behind this concept, offering insight into its application and understanding within his learning environment.

### **Bullish Order Block and Narrative**

*   The speaker identifies a small fair value gap after the market clears a down-closed candle, defining it as a bullish order block.
*   The speaker emphasizes the importance of a bullish narrative for this to be considered a valid bullish order block.
*   **"If the narrative is bullish, that qualifies this as a valid bullish order block."**
*   Without a confirming narrative, a down-closed candle remains just a down-closed candle.
*   A volume imbalance respects the movement, which the speaker deems "perfect."

### **Comparison to Other Trading Educators and Methodologies**

*   The speaker claims that Steve Nison and other educators do not teach this concept.
*   **"Steve Nison will never teach you that, okay? There's no other educator out there again, not happening."**
*   He states that Hurst, John Murphy, new market Wizards, and Jack Schwager's books lack any information on this concept.
*   **"Hearst ain't happening, nothing John Murphy got nothing like that in his book about this new market Wizard and any Jack Swagger's books know anything about this and that's just the God's honest truth."**
*   He acknowledges that this may upset some people or disrupt their "team mentality."
*    **"I'm sorry if that upsets you and it gets your team mentality all in a disarray but it's the truth."**

### **Confronting Resistance and Truth**

*   The speaker warns that resisting the truth will lead to negative consequences.
*   **"If you want to fight it and resist it, you do it at your own peril. You're deferring new understanding with truth, and you can't wrestle with truth and become Victorious."**
*   He believes that eventually, the truth will "grind you down," and there is no escape.
*   The speaker shares that many initially skeptical individuals ("trolls") eventually come to understand and accept his teachings.
*   He encourages listeners to personally investigate and verify the validity of his claims.

### **Character and Due Diligence**

*   The speaker commends those who have done their due diligence and recognized the truth in his teachings.
*   **"And for the people that have character, they have done that, and I haven't slapped around said see you idiot no, I just encourage them well done you."**
*   He emphasizes the importance of independent verification rather than blindly accepting information from others.
*   He posits that markets are "scripted" and understanding the "source code" allows one to "read them just like a book."
*   **"They're scripted folks, they're absolutely scripted and when you understand the source code hint hint nudge nudge you can read them just like a book that you read so many times."**
*   The speaker describes how experienced traders can anticipate market movements and outcomes, which may appear as "wizardry" or "fraud" to outsiders.

### **Time Travel Analogy and Encouragement**

*   The speaker likens the power of understanding market dynamics to "time travel."
*   **"That power that Insight that visibility is the closest thing I can put you in terms of time travel."**
*   He concludes by expressing hope that listeners found his insights helpful and encouraging.
*   **"So hopefully found something insightful in this if not anything else encouraging and so I'll talk to you next time be safe."**

# **Market Analysis: Stock Index Futures (Monday)**

## **Introduction**

Welcome back, folks! This is a short review of the stock index futures for today's trading session on Monday. I won't be covering the Dollar Index or the Forex market today, as I'm not feeling well and need to rest. Hopefully, I'll be back in full swing tomorrow and we'll delve into those markets then.

---

## **S&P 500 Analysis (Daily Chart)**

*   **Chart Location:** Left-hand side of the screen.
*   **Observation:** We saw a small sell-side imbalance, along with a buy-side inefficiency between the low of one candle and the high of another.
*   **Consequent Encroachment:** The midpoint of that range, which is the "consequent encroachment," is marked by a line on the chart.
*   **Market Movement:** After taking sell-side liquidity, the S&P 500 may move higher tonight and tomorrow, potentially drawing towards a fair value gap.
*   **Bearish Outlook:** I'd like to see that fair value gap remain open, which would act in a bearish manner, allowing for continuation to the downside.
*   **Permissible Range:** It's perfectly reasonable for the price to move up into that area, even allowing for a slight wick outside of the inefficiency.
*   **Overall Stance:** Nothing has changed in terms of my intermediate-term view of lower prices.
    *   **Disclaimer:** This doesn't mean I won't take a long position, and it's not intended to inspire you to trade in any particular direction. I'm simply sharing my opinion.

---

## **NASDAQ Analysis (Daily Chart)**

*   **Chart Location:** Right-hand side of the screen.
*   **Sell-Side Liquidity:** Sell-side liquidity has been taken below recent price action.
*   **Potential Retracement:** It's reasonable for the price to trade down there and then rally back up into the inefficiency.
*   **Breaching Inefficiency:** The price went slightly outside of one inefficiency and got very close to trading into another.
*   **Key Inefficiency:** If either index is going to fill a fair value gap, the NASDAQ is more likely to do it.
*   **Desired Outcome:** I would prefer the price to be repelled by the inefficiency and start moving lower from there.
*   **Alternative Scenario:** I don't want to see it trade above that inefficiency, because if it does, it might find support, and we'd have to start considering buy-side liquidity as a target.
*   **Current Stance:** Right now, I'm maintaining the view that, in the intermediate term, we're hunting liquidity down into an inefficiency.

---

## **NASDAQ: Four-Hour Chart Analysis**

*   **Sell-Side Imbalance:** The sell-side imbalance and buy-side inefficiency (a fair value gap) traded up into it on the 17th, leading to a sell-off (highlighted in red).
*   **Daily Fair Value Gap:** Again, this shaded area represents a daily fair value gap, specifically a sell-side imbalance and buy-side inefficiency.
*   **Consequent Encroachment (Four-Hour):** Its midpoint is the "consequent encroachment," highlighted with a line.
*   **Market Action:** We took sell-side liquidity on the daily chart, consolidated, made a lower low, and then rallied back up into the daily chart's sell-side imbalance and buy-side inefficiency.
*   **Bearish Order Block:** We're turning up into a bearish order block and then consolidating into the close.
*   **Shaded Area:** The shaded area on the NASDAQ chart represents the respective sell-side imbalance and buy-side inefficiency from the daily chart.
*   **Small Fair Value Gap:** The price traded down into a small fair value gap. It's worth annotating that on your own charts.
*   **Chart Annotation Tip:** I’m trying to keep things as clean as possible so you can add these details to your own charts.

---

## **Important Reminder: Charting and Analysis**

*   **Avoid Shortcuts:** Don't just take my charts and write all over them – you're cheating yourself!
*   **Develop a Routine:** Make creating your own charts a daily routine; it's like a form of meditation.
*   **Market Connection:** This process allows you to get closer to the market.
*   **Learning Process:** Try to set up your charts like mine; this teaches you how many candlesticks to keep on your chart.
*   **Familiarity:** Repeating this process will help you become more familiar with the market.
*   **NASDAQ vs. S&P:** The market came all the way back down to the low end of the daily inefficiency on the NASDAQ, whereas we went outside of that range on the S&P 500.

---

## **Hourly Chart Analysis**

*   **Buy-Side Repo:** We have a buy-side repo here, with the daily inefficiency still in play.
*   **Respect for Inefficiency:** Note how the bodies of the candlesticks were respecting the daily inefficiency – it’s beautiful.
*   **Sell-Side Target:** The price ran down and took sell-side liquidity with a lower low, then rallied up to the high of the daily sell-side imbalance and buy-side inefficiency.
*   **Bearish Order Block Target:** The rally is specifically aiming into that bearish order block.
*   **NASDAQ Focus:** On the NASDAQ chart (right-hand side), we got very close to taking its respective buy-side liquidity.
*   **Potential Draw:** As mentioned earlier, the NASDAQ will probably draw up into that area either tonight or in tomorrow's morning session.
*   **Crucial Observation:** How we trade there is crucial, in my opinion.
*   **Higher Low Formation:** Notice the higher low formed on these respective lows.
    *   **Timeframe:** Approximately 2 AM to 11 AM (verify on your charts).
*   **Bullish Breaker:** We also have a bullish breaker, represented by the up-close candle prior to the rotation lower.
    *   **Market Action:** We had a low, a lower low, then traded higher, cutting through supply.
    *   **Beautiful Trade:** We traded right down into the bullish breaker beautifully at the time SMT (Smart Money Technique) was present, and wicked outside of that daily sell-side imbalance and buy-side inefficiency (the shaded pink area).
    *   **Aggressive Takeout:** Then we rallied all the way back up to aggressively take out the buy-side liquidity.
*   **Similar Pattern (S&P 500):** Similar pattern on the S&P 500.
*   **X-Ray View:** The up-close candle gives you an X-ray view of price.

---

## **15-Minute Timeframe Analysis**

*   **SMT Divergence:** You can see the SMT divergence here versus the NASDAQ's higher low.
*   **NASDAQ Preference:** I elected to trade the NASDAQ today because it was respecting its daily inefficiency.
*   **Price Action:** The price went down, respected the inefficiency, rallied up, and the bodies stayed inside the inefficiency (with a wick going outside). Then, it broke down.
*   **Breaker Pattern:** You'll see there's a breaker pattern in lower timeframes.
*   **Obvious Sell Side:** The sell-side liquidity was obvious as it ran.
*   **Bullish Breaker:** The price then went to the bullish breaker (as mentioned earlier).
*   **Weaker S&P Structure:** The S&P 500 had a little weaker market structure, and it wasn't as clear.
*   **Premium Disparity:** It wasn't in as much of a "premium" as the NASDAQ.
*   **NASDAQ High:** The high of that daily inefficiency was reached on the NASDAQ, but not on the S&P 500.
*   **Consequent Encroachment (S&P 500):** The S&P 500 did go to consequent encroachment, which is the midpoint of the shaded area anchored from the daily chart.
*   **Review Tip:** If you're getting lost in the transitions from one timeframe to the next, rewind the video to see how all these levels are transposed from the daily chart down to lower timeframes.
*   **Respect for Consequent Encroachment:** We're seeing respect for the consequent encroachment, which is the midpoint of the shaded area in pink.
*   **NASDAQ Superiority:** The NASDAQ went higher inside its respective daily range (the pink box).
*   **Trade Conclusion:** That's a better short, it went lower and attacked the sell side.

---

## **Five-Minute Chart Analysis**

*   **S&P 500 Inconsistency:** The S&P 500 was not as organized in terms of its market structure.
*   **NASDAQ Signature:** The NASDAQ went to the high end of the daily inefficiency (the sell-side imbalance and buy-side inefficiency).
*   **Perfect Signature:** Look at the bodies respecting it – it's perfect! That's what I'm looking for.
*   **Pair Selection:** These signatures help me decide which Forex pair (e.g., pound/dollar vs. euro/dollar, or Aussie/dollar vs. New Zealand/dollar) to trade.
*   **Higher Premium Short:** I want to be in the one that has the higher premium at the time, even if the S&P 500 makes a lower low and has the lower low for the SMT.
*   **Sell-Side Target:** I'm aiming for the sell-side liquidity, and the NASDAQ delivered.
*   **Bodies Respected:** Look at how the bodies stopped dead in their tracks on that low.
*   **Bullish Breaker Rally:** The price wicked through, hit the bullish breaker, and then rallied.
*   **Bearish Order Block:** Since I was asleep during the rally I was not able to participate in the rally until it started to trade lower, and used that bearish order block for my second exit.
*   **Institutional Order Entry Drill:** The bullish breaker became an inversion level where the midpoint of that starts a rally. The bullish breaker starts a rally which accelerates and takes out the high before a nice Silver Bullet at 2 o'clock.

---

## **One-Minute Chart Analysis**

*   **Bearish Breaker:** We have a high, a low, a higher high, and the down-closed candle is a bearish breaker.
*   **Breaker Interaction:** We trade into that breaker, trade outside of its range, and then right back up into it.
*   **Equal Highs:** Relative equal highs get taken out in the afternoon, and the price drops down.
*   **NASDAQ Setup:** High, low, higher high. We have an inefficiency projected on the other side of the curve, which means we're running up as a Judas sell-off.
*   **Inversion Fair Value Gap:** We have an inefficiency projected to the other side that has become a potential inversion fair value gap.
*   **Daily Inefficiency:** If it hadn't traded to the high end of that daily sell-side imbalance and buy-side inefficiency, but instead only went as high as the high of the red shaded area, and then dropped, I would have used that inefficiency to go long and reach for the high end of the daily inefficiency.
*   **Consequent Encroachment Respect:** Note how the bodies are respecting the consequent encroachment, and it accelerates down to the sell-side.
*   **First Trade:** That was the first trade based on the framework.
*   **Silver Bullet Short:** We had a beautiful run-up, and this is a nice Silver Bullet short, attacking the sell-side liquidity and the bullish breaker level.
*   **Trade Exit:** I got my second trade exit, and I was away from the charts when the price ultimately went higher.

---

## **Trading Results and Final Thoughts**

*   **NASDAQ Focus:** I only did a little bit of work today for the NASDAQ, and I didn't touch the S&P 500.
*   **Profit:** I was able to add another $2600 to the live account.
*   **Proof:** I showed that on Twitter – feel free to take a look.
*   **Health Update:** I'm going to get some rest; I know I'm under the weather because I'm wanting a lot of sleep.
*   **Conclusion:** I'll talk to you tomorrow – be safe!

Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, retaining all details and nuances while enhancing clarity and readability:

# Market Analysis - [Date/Time Implied from Context: Late August/Early Fall]

## Introduction
Welcome back, folks! We're doing another quick market review. I'm still not feeling well, so I'll try to keep this brief.

## Dollar Index Analysis
*   **Overall Outlook:** A very soft bias for a higher dollar.
*   **Technical Observation:** Looking for a higher high on the Dollar Index.  We achieved that today.
*   **Future Potential:**  Although we failed to reach it today, I'm not convinced we're done trying to get to it yet.

## Euro Analysis
*   **Key Levels:** Looking at relative equal lows.
*   **Recent Price Action:** Pierced these lows today, but it doesn't look like it's done.
*   **Inversion Fair Value Gap:**  We chewed up into consequent encroachment (the level here).  We hit that, sold off, and then dug into the sell-side.
*   **Expectation:** I think it would be more likely to expect a deeper run below these lows which is the opposite of what we see or in it what I'm expecting rather for another higher high on the dollar Index and that would be another lower low for Euro.
*   **Four-Hour Chart:** Shows the relative equal lows were just pierced; very difficult ranges to trade in. I feel for you if you're in Forex that's that class right now.

## British Pound Analysis
*   **Current State:** Just to toss Us in here you can see this thing is a mess too, can't get out of this range.
*   **Range-Bound Trading:** This is what we've been seeing for the whole entire month of August.
*   **Summer Trading Caution:** You want to trade in the summer months and try to get a funded account challenge passed? Good luck! That's why I tell you, don't do it; wait until the fall.

## S&P 500 Analysis
### Daily Chart
*   **Previous Prediction:**  I mentioned that we would likely drop into this gap here. I did not have the lines on it but they point to it last night.
*   **Level Reached:** I did mention that it would certainly get to this one here.
*   **Focus:** What I want to see is do we start to roll over here and make a run for the sell side here?
*   **Target:** This sell-side liquidity pool on the S&P would be where my focus would be.

### Hourly Chart
*   **Daily Inefficiency Identification:** The inefficiency on the daily chart.
    *   This candle's high, this candle's low - these are the respective levels here.
    *   These two red levels make up the fair value gap on the daily chart.
*   **Fair Value Gap:** I mentioned last night that this fair value gap is for the NASDAQ. I did not include the order block level here; I added that today.
*   **Price Action:**
    *   Buy-side taken; look at the bodies respecting the lower level dealing fair value gap.
    *   Then, we had the market trading lower, gravitating back towards the consequent encroachment of the inefficiency on the daily chart, straight down to the low, or the inefficiency just outside of it, and then consolidated inside of that range.
*   **Daily Bearish Order Block:** We traded outside of the inefficiency. This is the high and the low of its respective daily fair value gap, and we had sell-side here.
    *   We ran up, broke lower, consequent encroachment (midpoint between this high and this low on the daily fair value gap - that's what these two levels are) encroachments here for that, and we sold off, and they were consolidated.

### 15-Minute Time Frame
*   **Price Action:** You can see how we each end up in the S&P into the low of the daily fair value gap we were expecting to be traded to last night for today's Trading Market broke lower entered all the way down to the low only down to a lot of daily inefficiency just a real sloppy afternoon if you were to ask me.

### 5-Minute Chart
*   **S&P Analysis:**
    *   Digs into that daily fair value gap.
    *   Breaks lower.
    *   Consolidation breaks again.
    *   Nice little fair value gap there; trades up into it, then the displacement lower.
    *   Look at the bodies respecting the inefficiency here on the sell-side of bounds.
    *   Buy-side inefficiency - that candle's low; there's your bodies.
    *   The wicks do the damage; breaks lower.
    *   Consequent encroachment consolidation (rather sloppy) and digs down into the low of the inefficiency from the daily chart.

## NASDAQ Analysis
*   **Daily Chart:** We trade up into the bearish order block here, which is above the daily inefficiencies high.
*   **Premium Market:** We're really in a premium on this one, and we have relative equal lows down here where the south side would be residing.
*   **Key Levels:**
    *   Broke lower.
    *   Look at a smaller fair value gap in here over time frames.
    *   Broke lower.
    *   Breakaway gap; unable to get back up into this area here.
*   **Market Structure:**
    *   Working over for breaker high, low, higher high.
    *   Consolidation breaks lower; attacks the sell-side.
*   **Bearish Order Block:** So we're really in a premium on this one, and we have relative equal lows down here where South Side would be residing.
*   **5-Minute Chart Observations:**
    *   Short-term low displacement.
    *   Fair value gap (this is model 2022).
    *   Sell short, wait for displacement, attack this low here.
    *   Creates another inefficiency here, but what is it doing? Trading inside of this one.
        *   High and low.
        *   Consequent encroachment.
        *   Consequent encroachment failed.
    *   Break lower for sell-side right there.
    *   Breaks lower, creates a fair value gap there; trades up into it then makes a lower low and then consolidates into the close.

## Conclusion
I appreciate your patience with me while I'm recuperating. I'll obviously chat with you on Twitter tomorrow and do another review if it's possible. Until then, talk to you then; be safe.

### NASDAQ Futures Contract Analysis: September 2023 Delivery

#### Introduction

This analysis reviews the NASDAQ futures contract for September 2023 delivery, focusing on a trading strategy called **TGIF** (Thank God It's Friday) and its application in a live trade. The strategy is based on retracements within a weekly range and is intended to challenge the notions of market randomness and simplistic supply/demand dynamics.

**Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0yOpwSilnE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0yOpwSilnE)

#### Weekly Chart Analysis

*   The analysis begins with a **weekly chart** of the NASDAQ futures contract.
*   Attention is drawn to the **previous week's high and low.**
*   **TGIF Setup:** This proprietary concept involves a retracement to **20-30% of the weekly range**.
    *   The presenter notes that his students have been using this strategy for years and he has been using it since 1998.
    *   The setup is not found in books or widely discussed.
    *   **Power Three:** Bullish week forming a high around potential high of the week.
    *   Anticipate run back down into the **20-30% of weekly range**.
*   **TGIF Concept:**
    *   The market trends in one direction for most of the week (upward in this case).
    *   It then retraces, offering a trading opportunity.
    *   **Challenge to Randomness:** This challenges the idea of markets being entirely random.
    *   **Supply and Demand:** Also challenges the notion that buying and selling pressure are the sole determinants of price movement.
    *   **Precision:** The presenter emphasizes the precision involved, suggesting that specific price points are targeted, not random outcomes.
*   **Trader Statistics:** The argument is made that the high percentage of traders who lose money (90%) challenges the idea of absolute market randomness.

#### Daily Chart Analysis

*   The analysis shifts to the **daily chart**.
*   **Sell-Side Imbalance, Buy-Side Inefficiency (Busy):** A shaded area is identified, representing this.
    *   It's measured from this candle's high to that candle's low midpoint.
    *   The midpoint is referred to as **"Consequent Encroachment" (CE)**.
*   **Anticipation:** The market could trade up to that CE level on Friday.
*   This level corresponds to a specific point on the one-minute chart, as highlighted below.

#### One-Minute Chart Analysis and Trade Setup

*   **One-Minute Chart:** The analysis now focuses on the one-minute chart to illustrate the trade execution.
*   **Pre-Market Activity:** All the highs before the stock market opening bell were targeted.
*   **Market Action:**
    *   Market dropped after running the highs.
    *   Created a **Fair Value Gap (FVG)**.
    *   Opened, traded up once more, then went lower.
*   **Buy-Side Liquidity:**
    *   The presenter wanted to see the lows taken out.
    *   **Buy Stops:** This area represented buy stops (traders anticipating a breakout).
    *   The presenter does not favor breakout trading.
*   **Target:** He wanted to see the buy-side taken out first, followed by the sell-side (relative equal lows).
*   **Prior Video:** The presenter refers to an interactive study on his YouTube channel, encouraging viewers to analyze his trading rationale.
*   **Trade Entry:** The market trades up into the fair value gap.
*   **Target Area:** The market breaks down into the buy-side imbalance and sell-side inefficiency (busy) area.

#### Live Trade Execution

*   **Real Account:** The presenter transitions to showing a live trade (not a demo account) with real money at a CFTC-regulated broker (AMP Futures).
*   **Busy Area:** The presenter wanted to see the market trade through the busy area (high to low of a candle), indicating a complete overlap.
*   **Objective:** The objective was to run through this area down into the sell-side liquidity at the low end of the daily chart.
*   **Speed of Delivery:** The presenter anticipated a rapid price movement, which materialized.
*   **Weekly Range Retracement:**
    *   The low objective for the weekly range retracement (**TGIF target**) was **15,455**.
    *   The actual low reached was **15,454** (one handle below).
*   **Fair Value Gap:** The price traded inside this fair value gap.
*   **Target:** Trading just below Thursday's low, targeting a specific price level of **15,460.25**, which he had tweeted about on Friday (time and date stamped).

#### Live Trade Details

*   **Brokerage:** AMP Futures (verified as a live account in the lower-left corner).
*   **Entry:** The presenter went short as the market traded up into the fair value gap (shaded in pink on the right side).
*   **Stop Loss:** The stop loss was placed just above the longest wick, above the midpoint (consequent encroachment).
*   **Reasoning:** He believed the price wouldn't go back up there.
*   **Market Observation:** He noted the failure of NASDAQ to make a higher high, contrasting with the higher high formed on the S\&P, indicating **SMT (Smart Money Technique) Divergence**.
*   **Real-Time Commentary:** The presenter emphasizes that the commentary is live and not sped up.
*   **Twitter Space Challenge:**
    *   Two days prior, in a Twitter space, he stated his model could deliver a $15,000 trade.
    *   Someone challenged him, doubting it would happen, suggesting it would only be on a paper trading account.
*   **Conviction:** He anticipated the buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency area being completely disregarded and run through.
*   **Legitimacy:** The presenter states it would be illegal to falsely claim live fund trading.
*   **Monitoring:** He monitored the price, wanting to see it accelerate through the low end of the shaded area.
*   **Stop Adjustment:** He moved the stop to better than break even.
*   **Trade Management:**
    *   He committed to a full position (no partial exits).
    *   The target was the sell-side liquidity.
*   **Profit Target:** He promised everyone in the Twitter space he could deliver $15,000 in a real account (not a demo account).
*   **Strategy Disclosure:** The presenter revealed that the strategy used was already taught for free in the **Model 2022 playlist** combined with the **TGIF video**.
*   **Trade Closure:** He closed the trade as it traded below it.
*   **Profit Realized:** A profit of **$15,400** was made in a live account using the strategies taught for free on his YouTube channel.

# Live Streaming the Market: A Noob's Journey and Market Analysis

## Introduction

**Video URL:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhYcXBI3z9U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhYcXBI3z9U)

The content explores the intersection of live streaming challenges and real-time market analysis through the eyes of someone relatively new to live streaming. The purpose of this stream is not only for public consumption but also as a homeschooling tool, teaching his son about market observation and tape reading.

## Technical Issues and Stream Settings

*   The streamer addresses initial technical issues encountered during a previous attempt.
*   Adjusted latency settings:
    *   Original setting: "Low" (middle setting on YouTube's live stream Studio).
    *   Reason for Adjustment: Glitching and skipping reported by viewers on Twitter.
    *   New setting: "Normal" latency.
    *   Implications: Acknowledges that the increased latency might allow viewers to perceive a "delay," but aims for stability.
*   Requests feedback from viewers: Asks for a "five by five" confirmation via Twitter if audio is clear.
*   Plans to delete the glitched previous stream due to its short duration and technical issues. He prefers a complete broadcasting.

## Chart Setup and Time

*   **Charts being used:**
    *   Left-hand side: E-mini S&P 500 (ES) daily chart, September 2023 contract.
    *   Right-hand side: Nasdaq daily chart, September 2023 contract.
*   **Time Stamp:** New York local time, 9:13 AM.

## Educational Intent and Market Approach

*   **Intended audience:** Stream is for viewers and his youngest son.
*   **Homeschooling context:** Market analysis is a daily part of his son's curriculum.
*   **Objective:** To observe price action, especially in the context of intraday volatility.
*   **Trading strategy:** Aims to "read the tape" and identify clues left by algorithms in the marketplace.
*   **Bias:** The streamer begins the day with no pre-set directional bias.
*   **Time constraints:** The live stream will conclude no later than 11:00 AM.
*   **Incentive for son:** An extra 1.5 hours of video game time if he learns well during the session.

## Determining Market Focus: ES vs. Nasdaq

*   Addressing a common question: How to choose between ES and Nasdaq for a trading session.
*   Personal preference mentioned: The streamer will decide whether to focus on ES or NASDAQ based on his observations during the session
*   **Quick Analysis Method**

    *   When faced with limited time for pre-market analysis (e.g., oversleeping, unexpected interruptions).
    *   Uses the daily chart to identify:
        *   Obvious price behavior.
        *   Price levels that have been respected or disrespected.
        *   Salient points in price action.
        *   Acknowledges that viewers may see different things based on their own understanding.

## Holiday Trading Caution

*   **Post-Holiday Dynamics**: Highlights the challenges of trading the morning session after a holiday (Labor Day in this case).
*   **Volatility Consideration:** Cautions against rushing into large trades due to potentially unpredictable market behavior.
*   **Personal Experience**: Recounts a profitable short trade in Nasdaq yesterday.
*   **Risk Management Emphasis:** Stresses the importance of experience and caution for new traders.

## Disclaimer and Responsibility

*   **Cautionary advice for funded account challenges:**
    *   Strongly advises against using his analysis as a basis for trades during a funded challenge.
    *   Encourages viewers to rely on their own analysis and trust their judgment.
    *   Warns of potential blame if his influence leads to missed trades or losses.
*   **Emphasis on individual responsibility**: Reiterates that trading decisions are solely the responsibility of the individual trader.

## S&P 500 (ES) Daily Chart Analysis

*   **Annotation:** Focuses on a specific area on the chart.
*   Identifies a **fair value gap (FVG)** in the form of a **sell-side imbalance buy-side inefficiency (SIBI)**.
    *   **SIBI Definition:** A down-closed candle that creates a fair value gap.
    *   Low of the candle: 4531.91
    *   High of the candle: 4547.50
*   **Explanation:** The market is likely to revisit this area.
*   Notes that the market "bumped up" into this area on Friday.
    *   High on Friday: 4547.75
    *   One-quarter of a point higher than the candle high.
    *   Indicates a "premium" level, but not necessarily a limit to upward movement.
*   Identifies a **volume imbalance**.
    *   Candle's closing price compared to the next candle's opening price.
    *   "There's a distinction between the two where there's no body no other candle body that overlapped between this candle's clothes and this candle is opening"
    *   This is considered a "volume imbalance."
*   Explains that the market will likely want to revisit this area until a candle body overlaps the gap.
*   **Reference Points and Expectations**
    *   Highlight of wick midpoint at 3475 level.
    *   For shorts, wants to see price stay below that level
    *   Does not want to see price go above the red line.
    *   Intraday strategy uses lines between red and blue lines.

## S&P 500 (ES) Hourly Chart Analysis

*   **Inefficiency**: Highlights an inefficiency with a fair value gap and a down closed candle (SIBI).
*   **Buy-side Liquidity Pool**: Notes a buy-side liquidity pool (buy stops) above recent highs.

## Nasdaq Daily Chart Analysis

*   **Fair Value Gap (FVG):** Identifies a fair value gap in the form of a **sell-side imbalance buy-side inefficiency (SIBI)** on the daily chart.
*   **Trading Activity**: Price traded up into that area.
*   **Consequent encroachment (50% level)**:
    *   Defined: Midpoint of the high-low range of the fair value gap.
    *   Trading behavior: Price traded above the midpoint on Friday and bumped into the low end of the SIBI today.
    *   Intraday observation: Price went lower than Friday's low.
*   **Potential Levels**: Highlights a low and opening price for the current candle.
*   **Preference**: Expresses more interest in Nasdaq than ES at this point.

## Nasdaq Hourly Chart Analysis

*   **Volume Imbalance Lines**: Mentions using volume imbalance lines from the daily chart.
*   **Anticipation**: Expects the market to potentially take out buy stops above.
*   **Line in the sand**: The halfway mark of the daily candle wick.
*   **Shorting Conditions**: Best case scenario to go short will be to stay below the line
*   **Directional Analysis**: If directionless, frame everything from daily charts
*   **Buy Stops (Buy-side Liquidity)**: Two locations:
    *   Above current price.
    *   Midpoint of the wick of the daily chart.
*   **Key Observation**: As long as we do not go above the closing basis on the hourly chart above the red level he will anticipate lower prices.
*   **Downside Targets**: Notes potential sell-side liquidity on the downside.

## Additional Notes and Terminology

*   Distinction between "wicks" and "tails" on candle charts.
*   Describes an "inversion fair value gap" which is a down closed candle gap called a SIBI.


Okay, here is the reorganized and refined text from the provided transcription, retaining all details and nuances while improving readability and structure:

# Live Streaming the Market: A Noob's Journey and Market Analysis (Continuation)

## Review of Previous Analysis
*   **Support and Failure:**
    *   The streamer notes that now that the price is above a certain level, it *should* act as support.
    *   However, he points out the presence of multiple "tails" (wicks) underneath, suggesting the possibility of failure.
    *   He prefers to see such setups fail, indicating a contrarian perspective.
*   **Trader Psychology:**
    *   He anticipates that other traders might interpret the setup as a building case for higher prices.
    *   While acknowledging this possibility, he expresses skepticism about its consistency.
*   **Potential Market Manipulation:**
    *   Suggests the market might run for buy stops above and then reach higher to target traders going short.
*   **Focus on Price Action at Key Levels:**
    *   Emphasizes the importance of observing how the market trades *at* specific levels, rather than simply reacting to them.
*   **Continued Interest in Nasdaq (vs. ES):**
    *   Reiterates that his primary attention remains on the Nasdaq.

## Nasdaq 60-Minute Chart Analysis

*   **Gap Identification:** Notes the presence of a gap.
*   **Holiday Market Uncertainty:**
    *   Highlights that holidays (especially Federal holidays) can introduce uncertainty into the market.
    *   The streamer looks to see what the market is doing after the opening bell.
*   **Buy Stops:** Indicates the location of two potential buy stops.
*   **Rejection Block Analysis:**

    *   Refers to a run-up on Friday, noting a similar structure (fair value gap) on a lower timeframe.
    *   Points out that the lower timeframe will show an "up-close candle" (busy) creating an "inversion fair value gap."
    *   Observes that the price action stops right in the middle of this area.
*   **Transition to One-Minute Chart:**
    *   Shifting to the one-minute chart to further analyze price action, he notes the lack of significant movement so far.
    *   Explains that this "back and forth" is typical after a holiday morning as traders try to determine the direction of the market.
*   **ICT Reference:** Mentions that viewers familiar with ICT (Inner Circle Trader) concepts might recognize the patterns he's describing.
*   **Fair Value Gap (FVG) Definition and Bearish Context:**
    *   Clarifies that the gray shaded area represents a candle's high and low, highlighting an inefficiency.
    *   Describes it as an up-close (busy) candle between two candles, creating a fair value gap (buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency).
    *   Emphasizes the bearish context due to the streamer's short position taken on Friday, which he traded live with real money (not demo, not a funded challenge).
*   **Fibonacci Tool Application:**
    *   Explains the use of the Fibonacci tool to measure the 50% level (consequent encroachment) of the inefficiency.
    *   Notes that the price reacted to this level like a "force field," hitting it and selling off.
*   **Student Perspective:**
    *   Acknowledges that students often find this type of analysis fascinating.
*   **Sell-Side Liquidity (Sell Stops):**
    *   Explains that lows that are close to each other indicate the presence of sell-side liquidity (sell orders below old lows).
    *   The market tends to gravitate towards these areas.
*   **Signatures:**
    *   Emphasizes that the market action is not random.
    *   States that computer algorithms dictate how price reaches predetermined level.
*   **Rejection Block Signatures**
    *   Notes "little reminders" (signatures) that the market is controlled by computers running scenarios to reach predetermined price levels.
    *   The market then reacts with either continuation or reversal.

## S&P 500 Reassessment
*   **ES Bullish Traps:**
    *   The price action is drawing back into volume imbalance levels after running over top of wicks.
    *   Other traders might view the wicks as bullish signals, but the streamer remains skeptical.

# Market Analysis: Intra-day Correlation and Post-Holiday Trading (5-Minute Chart Analysis)

## Initial Market Observation: NASDAQ vs. S&P 500 Divergence

*   **Time Frame:** Analysis based on a **5-minute chart** for both **NASDAQ** and **S&P 500 (SP)**.
*   **Low Comparison:**
    *   **NASDAQ:** Showing *higher* lows.
    *   **S&P 500:** Showing *lower* lows.
*   **High Comparison:**
    *   **S&P 500:** Exhibiting *lower* highs.
    *   This discrepancy indicates a potential *SMT* condition (market maker terminology).
*   **Key Observation:** These opposing movements are a significant clue that entering a trade at this time is ill-advised due to a lack of market agreement.

## Understanding Symmetrical vs. A-Symmetrical Markets

*   **Symmetrical Market:** Defined as a market where price runs are quick, decisive, and "move real nice" (low resistance liquidity run).
*   **Current Market Condition:** The current market is *not* conducive to symmetrical trading.

## Cracking Correlation: Significance and Context

*   **Failed Higher Highs (S&P 500):** The S&P 500 is showing an inability to sustain higher highs, which the NASDAQ *was* able to achieve.
*   **Higher Lows (NASDAQ):** Conversely, lower lows in the S&P 500 were *not* mirrored by lower lows in the NASDAQ.
*   **Cracking Correlation Defined:**
    *   In a *directional bias* scenario (e.g., bullish sentiment), a cracking correlation is when the S&P 500 makes a *lower* low, but the NASDAQ *doesn't*. If this occurs at a key support level (as previously demonstrated), it can present a buying opportunity.
    *   However, in the *absence* of directional bias (as in the current post-holiday morning session), cracking correlation further reinforces *uncertainty* and the expectation of choppy, unpredictable market movement.

## The Importance of Patience and Avoiding Impulsive Trading

*   **Experienced Trader Mindset:** Long-time students of the streamer understand the likelihood of such market behavior, especially after a holiday.
*   **The Urge to Trade:** Acknowledges the temptation, particularly for newer traders (and younger versions of himself), to constantly "push the button."
*   **Recommended Action:** *Sitting still* and allowing the market to reveal its intentions.
*   **Sentiment Trap:** Emphasizes that many participants are trying to force trades, creating "sentiment" (collective market opinion), which is often *contrary* to actual market direction.
*   **Potential Outcomes:** The market may either move in the opposite direction of prevailing sentiment or simply move sideways, frustrating traders.

## S&P 500 Analysis: Volume Imbalance and Potential Sell-Side Liquidity

*   **Recent Price Action:** The S&P 500 formed a high, a low, and then a higher high.
*   **Down-Closed Candle and Volume Imbalance:** Price traded *up* into a down-closed candle, coinciding with the high of a daily volume balance.
*   **Key Question:** Will the market respect this level and move *lower*, potentially trading into a highlighted wick?
*   **Sell-Side Liquidity Target:** Below that wick is sell-side liquidity.
*   **Rationale:** The S&P 500 is demonstrating an "unwillingness to go higher," unlike the NASDAQ, which consolidated and then moved higher.
*   **Relative Strength Assessment:** This indicates that the S&P 500 is *weaker* than the NASDAQ.

## Potential Market Rotation and Target Liquidity

*   **S&P 500 Scenario:** If the S&P 500 moves lower, it is likely to respect resistance and target sell-side liquidity.
*   **NASDAQ Implications:** This could cause the NASDAQ to "rotate over" and attack its own sell-side liquidity, even with its initial higher high.
*   **Identified Gap:** A small gap exists on the chart that could serve as a target.
*   **Sell Stops:** Sell stops are likely resting below this level.
*   **No-Risk Observation:** This analysis is purely observational; no trades are being executed.

## Risk Assessment and Observational Trading

*   **Hypothetical Scenario:** Even if the analysis is correct, navigating the potential price action (rolling down to a low, taking out sell-side liquidity, and then moving into a small inefficiency) is challenging.
*   **Stop-Loss Placement:** Placing a sufficiently small stop-loss in this environment is difficult due to a lack of clear market structure.
*   **Conclusion:** It's more prudent to *observe* price action without actively trading.
*   **Learning Without Pain:** Even without potential profits (or losses), these days offer valuable lessons about price behavior.

## Tape Reading and Market Mechanics

*   **Tape Reading Principle:** Observing how price behaves without any active trading involvement.
*   **S&P 500 Struggle:** The S&P 500 is having difficulty breaking above the daily volume balance.
*   **Potential Downside Scenario:** If the S&P 500 rolls down, it could drag the NASDAQ down to a specific low and a small "pocket of price."
*   **Inefficiency Identification:** There's a fair value gap right above the low which can be a source of buy stops.
*   **Liquidity Considerations:** If the market moves to this low, it will likely "wipe out" orders below it, as traders often move their stop-losses to just below such levels.
*   **Efficient Market Delivery:** The algorithm aims to facilitate efficient market delivery by addressing even small inefficiencies.

## Opening Range and Liquidity Analysis

*   **Time to 10:00 AM:** Approximately two minutes remaining.
*   **Opening Range:** Refers to the first 30 minutes of trading.
*   **Liquidity Establishment:** The liquidity established during the opening range is used for analysis until 11:00 AM.
*   **Fair Value Gaps (FVGs):** Any inefficiencies, such as FVGs, are also considered until 11:00 AM.

## Monitoring S&P 500 Behavior at Key Levels

*   **Focus on Midpoint:** Watching how the S&P 500 behaves as it reaches the midpoint of a previous candle's tail.
*   **Consequent Encouragement:** Prior to the potential drop, consider the consequent encouragement.
*   **Level Agreement:** Observing whether both the S&P 500 and NASDAQ reach their respective levels simultaneously.
*   **Relative Weakness:** Recognizing that the S&P 500 (ES) is the *weaker* of the two, making it more likely to move downwards as indicated.
*   **NASDAQ Strength:** The NASDAQ is showing relative strength by resisting the downward pressure.

## Intra-day Correlation Analysis and Trading Decisions

*   **Constant Measurement:** Continuously comparing and contrasting price delivery between the S&P 500 and NASDAQ.
*   **Disjointed Markets:** Today, the markets are "disjointed" (not moving in tandem).
*   **Waiting for Symmetry:** Waiting for a shift in intra-day correlation, where markets begin to move in sync.
*   **Post-Holiday Dynamics:** Observing when the lack of symmetry is overcome after the holiday.
*   **Calibration:** Once re-established symmetry happens, the market is said to be calibrated again and it's easier to trust and anticipate symmetrical movement.

## Journaling and Retrospective Analysis

*   **Post-Session Review:** If real-time observation isn't possible, review intra-day charts to identify when the shift in correlation occurred.
*   **Journaling the Shift:** Noting the time of day when symmetry was re-established for future reference.
*   **Trusting Symmetry:** Building confidence in the market's symmetrical behavior for subsequent trading days or sessions.
*   **PM Session Consideration:** If symmetry is re-established during the morning session, it may extend into the PM session (1:30 PM - 4:00 PM).

## Emphasis on Education and Avoiding Impulsive Actions

*   **Core Teaching:** The lessons being shared are about market dynamics, not just specific trade setups.
*   **Ugly Morning Sessions:** Understanding how to navigate potentially "ugly" and choppy morning sessions.
*   **Emotional Control:** Learning to avoid impulsive actions and the frustration of waiting.
*   **Trading Panel Absence:** The trading panel is intentionally *disabled* to prevent any impulsive button-pushing.
*   **Tape Reading Focus:** Emphasizing the importance of studying the tape to learn and trust market behavior.

## Preventing Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) and Promoting Discipline

*   **Holiday Trading Psychology:** Addressing the urge to trade after being "prevented" from trading on a full day.
*   **Gambling Mentality:** Recognizing that some traders may approach the market with a gambling mindset.
*   **Key Lessons:**
    *   Never fearing missing out on a trade.
    *   Avoiding impulsive behavior.
    *   Trusting the teachings and recognizing repeating patterns.
*   **Controlled Markets:** Repeating patterns indicate controlled markets, validating the effectiveness of the teachings.

## Real-Time NASDAQ Analysis and Key Levels

*   **Current Location:** NASDAQ is now within the blue shaded area (previously identified).
*   **Price Penetration:** The price has dipped slightly *below* a recent low.
*   **Immediate Reaction:** Observing how the price responds to the current level.
*   **Fair Value Gap (FVG) Consideration:** Will the price reject the FVG, use it as support, or reject lower?
*   **Probability Assessment:** Recognizing that certain trading days or sessions have a lower probability of success.

## Risk Management and Emotional Control

*   **Potential Consequences of Impulsive Trading:** Ignoring probability assessment and trading impulsively can lead to losses.
*   **Emotional Fallout:** Even small losses can trigger anger, regret, and a desire to "fix" the situation.
*   **Tailspin Scenario:** This can lead to a series of escalating losses, potentially harming trading capital or creating fear of future trades.
*   **Proactive Mindset:** The importance of approaching trading from the right point of view and not be surprised in the market.
*   **Average Trader Perspective:** An average person looking at current price would consider it to be choppy.
*   **Avoid Being Surprised:** Don't be surprised with the current market because it helps you anticipate market behaviors.

## Market Manipulation and Algorithmic Influence

*   **Market Activity Explanation:** The current market activity is seen as manipulation.
*   **Not Organic Supply and Demand:** Current market behavior is not a result of a normal buying and selling pressure.
*   **Sentiment and Algorithms:** Algorithms wait for a "bigger magnitude of sentiment" (excessively bullish or bearish).
*   **Unraveling and Running:** The market is then "allowed to unravel and run" against the majority of sentiment, targeting potential losses.
*   **Post-Holiday Mechanism:** This is the typical mechanism employed after holidays, driven by algorithms.
*   **Geopolitical Exceptions:** This pattern can be overridden by significant geopolitical events or news.

## Sentiment Analysis and Market Direction

*   **Current Market Impression:** Questioning if the market feels like it wants to go higher or lower.
*   **Audience Feedback:** Acknowledging that an audience member pointed down, suggesting a bearish bias based on a previous indication.
*   **No Preconceived Notions:** Stressing that is isn't necessarily bearish, but the question is whether a direction can be determined ahead of time.
*   **Question to Student:** Question to student - Do you feel like you should have known 30-40 minutes ago if market was going to go higher?


Okay, here is the reorganized and refined text from the provided transcription, retaining all details and nuances while improving readability and structure:

# Post-Holiday Market Analysis: Navigating Impatience and Algorithmic Influence

## Initial Assessment: Post-Holiday Trading Challenges

*   Acknowledges that the analysis is occurring on the trading day *immediately* after a holiday.
*   **Trader Psychology:**
    *   Traders had to "stay out" of the market yesterday.
    *   They now perceive only "four days left" in the trading week (today, tomorrow, Thursday, and Friday).
    *   This leads to heightened levels of *greed* and *impatience*.
*   **Market Reality:** The trading instruments being used may *not* be reflected accurately in the current price action.
*   **Resulting Behavior:** Expects traders to be:
    *   *Impulsive*.
    *   *Reckless*.
    *   Simply "pushing a button" and hoping for favorable outcomes.
*   **Classification:** This type of behavior is categorized as *gambling*.

## Real-Time Market Observations and Scenarios (S&P 500)

*   **Initial Focus:** Observing the price action after it moved "up over top of this wick."
*   **Key Question:** Does the market "run through this gap," and if so, does it treat it as *support*?
*   **Scenario 1 (Bearish):**
    *   If the price loses this level (goes below and comes back up to hit it).
    *   And it reacts to it as *resistance*.
    *   This would be favorable for a move *lower* (towards the shaded area).
*   **Scenario 2 (Bullish):**
    *   The S&P 500 may revisit "this volume of balance right in here."
    *   Even though a candle wick went slightly above it.
    *   Expectation is that price will "probably draw up into that."
    *   This movement would act as "allowing now, I just have to reach up into this..."

## Capital Preservation: A Core Trading Skill

*   **Today's Focus:** Learning how to *preserve capital*.
*   **Definition:** "That means keep your money in your account."
*   **Key Deficiency:** Individuals who lose their trading accounts, blow their accounts, or fail to find consistency often lack this skill.
*   **Specific Deficiencies:** These traders:
    *   Don't know *where* they are going to hurt themselves.
    *   Don't know *how* they are going to hurt themselves.
    *   Don't know *when* the market will be unfavorable.
    *   Don't know how to *predict* when the market will be unfavorable.
    *   Don't know when the market will be in *consolidation* or *choppy*.
*   **Consequences:** All of these factors lead to "illusion" in trading.
*   **The Undisciplined Trader:** Given enough time and opportunity, an undisciplined person will:
    *   Draw down their account.
    *   Blow their account.
    *   Especially on a day like today.
*   **Importance of Understanding:** It is crucial to learn this skill and understand what unfavorable market conditions "look like."
*   **Description of Unfavorable Conditions:** "Choppiness up and down up down down."
*   **Impact on Traders:** This type of market action is:
    *   Very *frustrating*, especially with an open trade.
    *   Creates *fear* and *nausea* when significant capital is at risk.
    *   Leads to concerns about the stop-loss order being triggered.
*   **Stop-Loss Function:** Forces you out of a trade, potentially:
    *   With a loss.
    *   With a limited amount of profit.
    *   Depending on where the stop-loss is placed.
*   **Positive Assessment:** Expresses satisfaction that the market is behaving as expected, providing a valuable learning opportunity for students.
*   **General Rule:** After a holiday, the morning session should be *avoided*.

## Scenario Updates and Contingency Planning (S&P 500)

*   **Observation:** Price went above a certain level with a wick, but there was no closing price above the volume balance.
*   **Implication:** This means the market can resume going *lower*.
*   **Revised Condition:** If the market goes back *above* this high, the current analysis will be discarded.
*   **Current Interest:** Only interested in seeing how the S&P 500 reacts to a specific low.
*   **Reasoning:** The S&P 500 failed to reach the volume of balance previously mentioned and only went slightly above the daily volume balance.
*   **"Mohawk" Analogy:** This slight breach above the volume balance is described as a "mohawk" or "coloring outside the lines."
*   **Revised Expectation:** If the market is going to move lower, it should *not* go back above this level.
*   **Alternative Approach:** If the price breaks the expected level, will look at the PM session (1:30 - 2:00).
*   **Addressing Shyness:** Encourages audience participation and addresses reluctance to ask questions.

## Refined Analysis and Target Levels (S&P 500 & NASDAQ)

*   **Current Situation:** The market has traded back down into a specific area.
*   **Ideal Scenario:** Would like to see it "bump the low of that shaded area," either:
    *   Just touching it.
    *   Having the close of the candle there.
    *   Then start a new candle and move lower.
*   **Explanation:** We went down to the wick Consequent Encroachment of that Wick.
*   **Note about wick:** The wick below the candle that’s what we had drawn there it drew down into that.
*   **Small Movement Significance:** Even though it's a small movement, it's noteworthy because the market went above the volume and balance but didn't close above it.
*   **Transition in Expectation:** When that happened, transitioned expectation to a trade *lower* into that wick, which is what it did.
*   **Trading Opportunity:** The movement from the high to that level could be profitable, potentially more than some viewers earn at their jobs.
*   **Disclaimer:** This is *not* an invitation to trade on days like this.
*   **Principle:** If small, predictable fluctuations can be identified, it's reasonable to assume that bigger moves can also be found.
*   **Sell-Side Interest:** Interest on the S&P 500 is reaching down to the sell-side.
*   **NASDAQ Expectation:** Expects the NASDAQ to "start to accelerate" and reach for the sell-side as well, targeting:
    *   A specific area.
    *   A small "pocket" of price.
*   **Further Sell-Side Potential:** If the market accelerates through that level, the sell-side will be the next target.

## The Benefits of Observational Trading

*   **Role Reversal:** The volume and balance will become *support*.
*   **Requirement:** The market has to get back above a high.
*   **Target:** Would like to see it touch the volume of balance high.
*   **Fair Value Gap:** If it hits that price, it could move up into a fair value gap.
*   **Inversion Figure:** Accelerating through the gap and tapping it would create an "inversion figure."
*   **Buy-Side Target:** This would then send it to the buy-side, targeting "relative equal highs right in here."
*   **Impact on NASDAQ:** This scenario would "supercharge" the NASDAQ to trade up into its second level of buyside.
*   **Caveat:** Unless everything unravels.
*   **Range-Bound Expectation:** If everything remains the same in terms of the range, use the launch macro half of the volume and balance.
*   **Threshold:** The S&P 500 would have to go above a certain high to flip expectation for the sell-side.

## NASDAQ Behavior and Key Levels

*   **Assessment:** The NASDAQ is described as "being a brat today."

*   **Sell-Side Target:** That's where the sell-side is.
*   **False Run Potential:** This low can act as a "false run point."
*   **Fibonacci Retracement:** Can take a fib from the high down to the low that's suspected to be a fault run point.
*   **Deviation Highlighting:** Uses standard deviation (negative and negative one-half).
*   **Analogy:** Compares the potential move to a door hinge, explaining how the distance of the move below a level can be projected based on the prior range.
*   **Contrasting Opinions:** Expresses the opinion that *if* it were not the trading day after the holiday, a short trade would have been taken when it was in a specific area.
*   **Stop-Loss Placement:** In that case, the stop-loss would have to be above a line and down up in here.
*   **Anticipated Outcome:** If it were not the holiday or post-holiday, would anticipate a low giving way and getting below a certain level.
*   **Speed Requirement:** If it were to show speed below that low.


Okay, here is the reorganized and refined text from the provided transcription, retaining all details and nuances while improving readability and structure:

# Post-Holiday Market Analysis: Advanced Trading Concepts & Observations

## Fibonacci Retracement and Standard Deviation: Identifying Target Levels

*   **Initial Expectation:** Expects price to "speed up" through the low and aggressively move into negative five or negative point five standard deviation.
*   **Standard Deviation Application:** This is calculated as half of the range from high to low below the low.
*   **Partial Profit Taking:** Half the trade would be taken off at the negative 0.5 standard deviation level.
*   **Balance Target:** The remaining balance would be aimed for at the negative one standard deviation level, plus the spread (approximately 102 handles).

## Navigating Indecisive Market Conditions: Post-Holiday Considerations

*   **Current Market State:** Recognizes that the current market is indecisive due to being the first morning session after the Labor Day holiday.
*   **Cautionary Note:** Emphasizes the need for caution and avoiding strong convictions in such conditions.

## Swing Trading Model: Optimal Setup and Execution

*   **Model Foundation:** The speaker's swing trading model (taught on YouTube) seeks specific setups that present shorting opportunities.
*   **Construction Approach:** Looking for a construction that allows framing a bearish scenario, where the market sells off and goes below a specific level.
*   **Ideal Symmetrical Placement:** The perfect symmetrical placement would be further down.
*   **Handling the Trade:** Wants to see speed as the price drops into half of the range.
*   **Bearish Market Conditions:**
    *   If in a bearish market or sell program.
    *   And without reservations about market stagnation (unlike today).
*   **Aggressive Approach:** Would go short without taking partials below the low.
*   **Execution:** Hold the position for the entire move down and use a trailing stop loss.
*   **Swing Traders Model Highlights:**
    *   Understanding when to take partials versus holding the entire position.
    *   Identifying when and where to expect speed in price movements.
*   **Fall From Point Concept:** Wherever you think if a low is taken out and you're bearish, whatever the previous run was just take that run and subtract it to the low and you'll get it.
*   **Application:** To determine this, place the Fibonacci tool on the high to the low. The negative one standard deviation will indicate the likely drawdown point.
*   **Optimal Swing Trade Exit:** Assuming a bearish cell program and equal conditions, the best-case scenario exit would be the identified level down below.

## Managing Indecisive Market Conditions: Protective Strategies

*   **Indecisive Market Action:** Because it's indecisive, I want to see it doesn't trade below there, you take out the sell side here, take out the South Side here.
*   **Hypothetical Trade (Not Taken):** If trading today (which the speaker is not, due to the holiday), would advise taking a partial profit below the low.
*   **Reasoning:** To learn to trust the setup and make it easier to hold the position to the lower target.
*   **Gradual Understanding:** Gaining experience and graduating in understanding comes from practical application, not just watching videos.

## The Golden Goose Analogy: Self-Reliance in Trading

*   **Goal of Teaching:** To enable traders to become self-sufficient ("your own Golden Goose").
*   **Emphasis on Trust:** Encourages trusting oneself over reliance on external sources.

## Market Symmetry and Readability: Identifying Key Challenges

*   **Symmetry Assessment:** Notes a lack of symmetry between the bodies of candles, making it difficult to read the market precisely.
*   **Journaling Recommendation:** Advised to take a screenshot and add it to your journal with the neutral annotations.
*   **Stop Loss Example:**
    *   If not for the post-holiday conditions, the stop-loss would have been hit.
    *   Emphasizes the importance of context and avoiding forcing trades in unfavorable environments.
*   **Value of Observational Analysis:** Underscores the ability to teach valuable lessons without taking on risk.
*   **Frustration of Illogical Trading:** Expresses frustration with those who don't appreciate logical, protective strategies.
*   **Analogy:** The speaker would love to have been in something like this when he was 20 because he would have been in this day all day long trying to do something and hurt himself

## Identifying Inversion FVG's and Breakaway Gaps in NASDAQ:

*   **Inversion Fair Value Gap** This Gap should act as potentially an inversion for Fair Value Gap on the basis of time if we get back above these highs right in here these bodies we run through that.
*   **Breakaway Gap:** if it were to leave this portion open right in here that could be a Breakaway Gap just not a lot of clean price action to work with in the NASDAQ.

## Price Action Analysis: Two Levels To watch in NASDAQ:

*   **Candle Body Midpoint:** NASDAQ where did the bodies candles perspected and go below the midpoint of this Wick or tail rejection blocks taken.
*   **Rejection Blocks Touch:** can we touch this level again it does it'll be treated as an inversion for your Fair Value Gap and wait to the volume and balance foreign balance again trading above it if it touches it we'll use the same idea that we're using down here if it was to come back down to us.

## Levels of Consequent Encroachment in NASDAQ:

*   **Consequent Encroachment Level** 4512 is your level for a consequent encroachment volume balance mean threshold.
*   **Bullish Stance:** longs or the idea of watching bullet price delivery should stay inside of this range of this down close candle but the no closing price should go below the midpoint of that down close camera that's basically what I'm getting in if it does do that it does support the idea of that that keeps everything bullish and then this high would not prevent price from going any higher and we look for it to trade into here so it's kind like you're constantly you're weighing price action every time it does something higher you look back and say okay where can it return back to safely and not undermine the underlying delivery of price on a day like today makes it difficult to do that but that's what my mind is cycling through looking at price right now.

## Hypothetical Tape Reading Long

*   **Tape Reading Long** This level that could have been used as a entry for a tape reading long not demo not combine challenge entry.
*   **Area to stay open:** I'd like to see this area over here stay open so no no return back into this area here it can be responsive right there on that candle's high right there in other words it should hit it and react and go higher use this area as a inversion and rip up into this level here remember this is the the upside above we were looking at what was running here.

## Relative Strength and Weakness: NASDAQ vs. S&P 500

*   **Upside Leader:** Identifies the NASDAQ as the "upside leader" and relative strength leader compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Trading Implication:** Longs would be more favorable in the NASDAQ, as it is more likely to deliver.
*   **S&P 500 as Laggard:** The S&P 500 is characterized as the "laggard" or weaker instrument.

## Short Squeeze Expectation:

*   **Short Squeeze:** I suspect that if we take this High out here there'll be a really nice short squeeze run up into the highs here.

## Managing Reluctance in Laggard Markets

*   **Allowing for Reluctance:** When observing the weaker instrument (S&P 500), allow for more reluctance in price movement.
*   **Meandering Price Action:** It may "meander around" a support level before eventually moving up.

## High Resistance Liquidity Run Analogy: The Greyhound Bus Trip

*   **CDL Bus Trip** I gave a story about the when I was getting my CDL I had to go take a Greyhound bus and I've never taken the Greyhound bus ever in my life but I had to go down to Charlottesville in Carolina and um the trip was supposed to be you know less than 10 hours and it took me like 18 hours and a guy fell asleep on my shoulder drooling on me and I didn't go to the bathroom the whole time and sit sipped the same water bottle because I was afraid if I drank anymore I'd want to go to the bathroom when I got up I'm like my legs and my ass were completely numb so my expectation going on that trip was it should take this long but in reality it was horrendous it was so long because they kept adding stops and stuff and I was getting pissed off I'm like what is going on here why won't this thing get me to where I gotta go why keep adding stops and it drives like well you know this is what we have to do I've never rode a Greyhound bus ever again and I never will okay it doesn't work like that.
*   **Greyhound Analogy:** High Resistance liquidity run signatures are much like that where they'll deliver they'll get you where you think it's going to go but it's going to get there on a Time schedule that you're probably not going to be comfortable in during.
*   **Premium and Discount Array.** when we do analysis we want to do a lot of work in determining which one is the leader which one's the laggard which one has the signatures that are supporting continuation which one has unfulfilled either premium in this case a premium array here and up here they're unfulfilled it's like unfinished business basically so we have to submit to a whole lot of discomfort like all this business in here like for instance if you were just using the midpoint which is the mean threshold I was talking about that order block.

## Volume and Momentum: Monitoring Key Indicators

*   **Desire for Momentum:** Wants to see the price leave the current area with momentum and speed to reach the higher target.
*   **Trap the Short Traders** They don't want to let the traders that are short off the hook, they want their stops sitting there and waiting to be taken out right here.
*   **Funds Order Flow** Funds, well they don't trade like a one minute chart it's not they're not using a limited chart but they're order flow is resting right there.

## Volume and Bodies: Analysis of NASDAQ

*   **Rounds through Bodies** the NASDAQ is stronger is it going to balance right here look at the bodies remember I'm telling you look at that it was very bad guy hits it rounds.
*   **Rally Paw** we're over here it's moving up but it's moving at a pace that's being met with rally paws work out the idea of the PD array is it going to hold is it going to use it to consolidate and then tears through it.

## PD Array

*   **Price above volume balance** if you were going to be using any one of those PD arrays would you go long at the volume of balance would you expect price to go up from the volume of balance would you expect it to go up from the consequent encroachment of this Wick let me draw that.

## Screenshot the Charts:

*   **Take screenshots: I mentioned I want to see speed through here I don't want to see any kind of like Meandering around like it did down here we don't want to see that.
*   **NASDAQ Chart: There's your buy side you want to screenshot your NASDAQ chart right now and go back through all this go back to all this price action here and remind yourself in your annotations that you knew that this was the upside leader this was the relative strength leader for NASA versus es so Longs would be more favorable in this one it'd be more likely that this one will deliver as I mentioned in the first few minutes of this live stream and this is the ones being the laggard.
*   **ES chart:** you want to screenshot your your s p chart right.


Okay, here is the reorganized and refined text from the provided transcription, retaining all details and nuances while improving readability and structure:

# Live Market Analysis: Order Flow, Breakaway Gaps, and Market Structure

## Live Trade Example and Analysis

*   Price moved up seven handles as expected.
*   Speaker notes he didn't execute the trade, but is observing price action.
*   Speaker states he's trying to stay in the trade until it hits a specific target.
*   CT (presumably another trader) is mentioned, with the speaker saying "she didn't push the button".
*   Speaker jokes about "pushing all kinds of buttons today," but it's not visible on the charts.

## Identifying and Annotating a Breakaway Gap

*   The speaker mentioned earlier wanting to see a specific area stay open.
*   If it stayed open, it would act as a breakaway gap.
*   Annotations on the chart would reflect this potential breakaway gap.
*   The chart setup is referred to as "maximize control."

## Calibration on the Daily Timeframe

*   Moving to the daily timeframe for calibration and context.
*   Speaker jokes about "focus" at the wrong time.
*   Acknowledges some "randomness" in the market.

## Silver Bullet Strategy: 11 AM and 10 AM Setups

*   **Buy Side Liquidity:** Notes that the buy side was taken.
*   **Silver Bullet (11 AM):** Reviews analysis of the Silver Bullet between 11 AM and 10 AM.
    *   Outlines how to use it with three different PD arrays.
    *   Asks if the analysis is "worthy of a thumbs up."
*   **Silver Bullet (10 AM):** Plans to do another Silver Bullet analysis at 10 o'clock.
    *   Looking for a fair value gap within a bias drawing towards liquidity.
    *   Price wasn't able to meaningfully move below the candle's tail.
*   **Body Narrative:** Notes that the bodies of the candles indicated unwillingness to go lower, and price rallied.

## Inversion Fair Value Gap: Key Observations

*   Attention was initially on a specific gap.
*   If price traded back down to it, it would be treated as an inversion fair value gap.
*   Price rallied through it.
*   This indicated that a specific level would be used to instigate a higher price run if it touched it again.
*   It didn't touch it again, it rallied.
*   This price action is a key observation to record in a journal.
*   Important to note what happened instead of solely focusing on what "worked."

## Range Analysis and Expected Price Action

*   Refers to a range previously identified (and shown red on the chart in the video).
*   If price went above the range and hit a specific point, that would be sensitive and send price higher to attack a specific inefficiency (unemployment balance) and eventually into a specific area.
*   Price didn't touch the specified level again.
*   Once it left it, it stayed open, reinforcing the idea of a breakaway gap.
*   Algorithm "forgot" to refer to that level (facetious personification).
*   The market rallied, indicating it wasn't interested in revisiting that level.

## Volume of Balance Levels: Potential Entry Points

*   Price went outside the daily volume of balance (two blue lines on the chart).
*   If price touched that level, it could also be a factor to allow a sensitive reaction where price could be used to go higher.
*   Price didn't do that either.
*   Both levels were being monitored.

## Breakaway Gap Identification: Learning from Missed Opportunities

*   Explains how he identifies breakaway gaps.
*   Describes what he would have done if he had a long position.
*   If he was long, he would have bought more and pyramided on the entry touching a specific level.
*   If it went up and came back down and touched that level, he would have added more.
*   Since it didn't do that and touched the top level (blue line – daily volume of balance level), he would have added more there.

## Addressing Misconceptions: Order Flow vs. 2022 Model

*   Explains that viewers don't understand why he buys at certain levels because they are using outdated models (2022 model, optimal trade entry, order blocks).
*   They are using limited exposure to his teachings without understanding all the other facets of order flow.
*   Emphasizes that this is real order flow, not dependent on DOM or other external indicators.
*   He is using what he's already taught and measuring the importance of how price either wants to come back to a level he expects it to, versus the fact that it doesn't deliver to it.
*   Not delivering isn't a failure; it's insightful and provides graduated understanding.

## Addressing Detractors and Promoting Real-Time Learning

*   Acknowledges that there are detractors watching who are likely upset.
*   References the buy side being hit after outlining the Silver Bullet live.
*   Challenges others to provide live streams with the same level of context.
*   Stresses that context is lost when simply doing execution videos of pyramiding and building positions.
*   Need the storyline behind price action, conceptually shared in real-time.

## The Importance of Tape Reading and Observation

*   While excited about upcoming books, it doesn't negate the need for tape reading and observation.
*   Observing instances of the candle going up and not offering another potential entry.
*   Neither at the lower level, nor at the high end of the volume and balance level.
*   Price ripped higher right into the volume and balance.

## Combining Higher Timeframe Analysis with Subordinate Timeframes

*   Since price broke away from the structure off of a higher timeframe PD array (volume and balance, two blue levels), he wants to see this area stay open.
*   Having that higher timeframe context on all subordinate timeframes (4-hour, hourly, 15-minute, 5-minute, 1-minute, seconds chart) allows you to trust what you're looking at.
*   While allowing for the market to go lower, it showed no willingness to do so.

## Shift in Market Structure and Disjointed Symmetry

*   The short-term high being taken to the upside indicates a shift in market structure.
*   This occurred while NASDAQ was still going higher.
*   The beginning stages of disjointed symmetry are emerging.
*   Typically occurs after a large range day or after a holiday.
*   Normal business of trading, order flow, and volume are disrupted.
*   The model used causes disruption in symmetry.
*   In the morning session, you need to wait until the market shows signs of symmetry where they start to agree with one another.
*   Even if you missed the best mover (NASDAQ), you can go to a weaker instrument (ES).

## Analyzing the ES (S&P 500)

*   Drew attention to a specific area in the ES chart.
*   The down-closed candle mean threshold was not closed below.
*   It wicked into it, routed back above, and took the buy side.
*   Traded into the area of the wick or tail of a candle, where the line is anchored.
*   Also, a fair value gap was present.
*   Liked both of those in agreement.
*   Saw price coming into that level.
*   Observed how the bodies of the candles were respecting that level and came back down.
*   Went above it and touched it, indicating inversion fair value gap.
*   Wanted to see it run right up into it so they couldn't pull their orders.

## Institutional Order Flow: Real-Time Observation and Learning

*   Emphasizes that this is real institutional order flow, not fake.
*   Viewers watched him do it live.
*   Walked through the adversities of the morning.
*   Explained in detail why he teaches not to trade in the morning session.
*   Taught another facet that will be in his book.
*   Will refer to this video in that chapter, as it will be beneficial to see the context.

## Reading the Books and Continued Chart Study

*   Reading the books won't automatically make everything click.
*   Still need to be in the charts, observing.
*   Some will still complain that he's hiding something.
*   He is literally spelling it out.
*   Experience, seeing it, studying it, journaling it, and being exposed to it by repetition are essential.
*   Recognition is a natural response to being repetitively presented with information from the charts.
*   Take snapshots of the charts with no candlesticks annotated.
*   Use the space to type out expectations (e.g., "I was expecting it to trade down here, and if it would have, that would have been a buy").

## Sensitive Responses and Inversion Levels

*   Used the example of trading down to the top of the fair value gap.
*   Emphasizes that it is not support and resistance, but institutional order flow.
*   Referred to the function of touching the level on the candle and the potential response.
*   That same response is how an inversion fair value gap works.
*   That's how any PD array can be inversion levels.
*   They are not zones, but very specific price points (highest, lowest, and midpoint).

## The Importance of Observational Study and Conditioning

*   Viewers are complicating the process.
*   Rushing through the required learning of sitting in front of price action and studying it.
*   Condition yourself by repetition to see it.
*   By doing that, you will recognize the things you're taking snapshots of.
*   You'll be able to walk out and see it live and call it out, just like he did.
*   This is not a skill set that will evade you if you do what he says.
*   The time it takes to learn is unique to each individual.
*   When you get it, it will feel like it wasn't that big of a deal.
*   It might take a couple of years to get really, really good and precise.
*   Even if you don't want to trade with a 1-minute chart, the experience it provides is valuable.

## Forex vs. Other Markets: The Universality of Price Delivery

*   Addresses comments asking to go back to Forex.
*   Asks viewers to listen to him about price delivery because it's the same in Euro Dollar, British Pound, Japanese Yen, and everything else.
*   If you don't study it and practice it, you won't see that.
*   Wasting the opportunity of being in front of him live because he's showing the same principles in all markets.
*   All of these markets are running on the algorithm.
*   Buying and selling pressure has no bearing on what was observed today; it's all time and price.
*   Utilized even in a sloppy day.
*   Silver Bullet forms every day, but you're not going to see it with limited exposure or experience.

## Fair Value Gap Example and Bullish Order Block Confirmation

*   Identifies the fair value gap.
*   Stop loss has to be below that candle because that's the low that makes the fair value gap.
*   It's also protected because you're below the mean threshold of that down-closed candle, which is a bullish order block.
*   Did your chart do the same thing he was telling his was going to do before it happened?
*   When you know this skill set, you will be able to predict the future just like he did.

## Transferable Knowledge and the Importance of Commitment

*   Veteran students can do this day in and day out.
*   It's transferable knowledge.
*   Urges viewers to roll up their sleeves and submit to the process.
*   It's going to take much more time than you want it to, but it's worth it.

## Concluding Remarks

*   Hopes the analysis was insightful and helpful.
*   If it helped you graduate in your understanding about institutional order flow, real market-making concepts, and how the algorithm absolutely books price.

# **Market Analysis and Trading Strategies**

## **Introduction**

Welcome back. This review will cover the **US Dollar Index (USDX)**, **Euro/Dollar (EUR/USD)**, **Pound/Dollar (GBP/USD)**, and **E-mini S&P 500 (ES) & NASDAQ (NQ) futures contracts**. We will also look at an additional approach to using PD arrays and how to build a model around it. This strategy is presented towards the end of this video.

## **US Dollar Index (USDX) Analysis**

*   **Higher Time Frame Perspective:** Last time, we anticipated a run-up into a **buy-side liquidity pool (BSL)**. This occurred.
*   We maintained a bullish outlook, anticipating a move higher, which occurred.
*   **Near Term:** Observe a small **volume imbalance**.
*   **Buy-Side Liquidity:** Resides at the top of the current range.
*   **Sell-Side Liquidity:** A strong run below relative equal lows occurred, taking sell-side liquidity and trading up through a **fair value gap (FVG)**.
*   **Overall Strength:** The USDX demonstrates underlying strength, placing intermediate and long-term pressure on **Euro/Dollar (EUR/USD)** and **Pound/Dollar (GBP/USD)** to move lower.
*   Longer term, more upside is expected.

## **Euro/Dollar (EUR/USD) Analysis**

*   **Daily Chart:** We previously noted an **inversion fair value gap (IFVG)**. Price traded up into it, respecting **consequent encroachment (CE)** – the midpoint of the gap.
*   The market broke lower, taking out sell-side liquidity.
*   Price aggressively moved lower throughout the week towards the sell side.
*   **Missed Opportunity:** A trade up into a small gap was anticipated, but the failure to reach it indicates "heaviness."
    *   **Heaviness:** Suggests the market is likely to go lower and attack the sell side.
*   With a stronger USDX, we anticipate lower prices for **"Fiber"** (a nickname for Euro/Dollar).

## **Pound/Dollar (GBP/USD) Analysis**

*   **Inversion Fair Value Gap (IFVG):** Present, and the market has been breaking lower.
*   **Next Draw on Liquidity:** Still remains at the sell side.
*   Price traded up into a small fair value gap. Lower time frames can be reviewed to see this.
*   **Institutional Order Entry Drill:** Price enters partially (less than half) of the fair value gap, then sells off.
*   **Near Term:** Sell-side liquidity rests below current levels.
*   **Bearish Stance:** We maintain a bearish bias for the British Pound.

### **Summary of Forex Analysis:**

*   Focus is on higher time frames for bias.
*   Smaller time frames are for individual analysis.
*   The approach has been delivering strong results.

## **E-mini S&P 500 (ES) Futures Analysis - September Delivery**

*   **Daily Chart:**
    *   Price fell just short of entering a discount fair value gap (FVG).
    *   **Buy-Side Imbalance Sell-Side Inefficiency (BISI/SI):** Exists between the low and high of a specific candle (denoted by blue lines).
    *   **Consequent Encroachment (CE):** Midpoint between the same candle's low and high (denoted by a red line).
*   **Buy-Side Imbalance Sell-Side Inefficiency Explanation:** The large upward movement is a **Buy-Side Imbalance Sell-Side Inefficiency**.
    *   It requires lower prices to be delivered, which has been observed.
*   **Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday Trading:**
    *   Unless you were scalping (1-5 minute charts), navigating intraday price action was difficult.
*   **Bookends Scenario:**
    *   Strong reasons exist for both higher and lower prices.
    *   This makes trading with precision difficult across all time frames.
    *   Infrequent opportunities will be observed.
*   **Trading Plan:**
    *   **No Trades:** Until price definitively trades above the buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency high or below the buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency low.
*   **Hourly Chart:**
    *   A fair value gap (FVG) exists.
    *   **Institutional Order Entry Drill:** Partial entry into the FVG occurred, followed by a breakdown.
    *   **Range Bound Trading:** Observed within this area.
    *   Break lower with small ranges.
    *   Trading down to the low of the inefficiency on the daily chart.
*   Price traded up to the consequent encroachment level, rolled over, and fell short of the inefficiency on the daily chart.
*   Sweeping below the low occurred.
*   The market returned back to the consequent encroachment levels
*   Thursday and Friday showed trading range.
*   **15-Minute Time Frame:** Return to consequent encroachment was observed.
    *   A strong sell-off occurred in the morning.
    *   The remaining price action requires extreme nimbleness and specific knowledge.
    *   If a winning trade is identified, take it and stop for the day.
    *   Avoid overtrading and undermining growth.
*   **Conclusion:** This area is problematic until a definitive exit from the range occurs.

## **NASDAQ (NQ) Futures Analysis - September Delivery**

*   **Daily Chart:**
    *   Similar to the E-mini S&P 500.
    *   **Buy-Side Imbalance Sell-Side Inefficiency (BISI/SI):** Defined by the candle's high and low.
    *   **Consequent Encroachment (CE):** Midpoint.
    *   **Trading Plan:** Price must leave this inefficiency higher or lower before trading interest resumes.
*   **Potential Scenarios:**
    *   **Bearish:** Trading down to 15126.5 is favored.
    *   **Bullish:** Rally higher, break out of the inefficiency, and close the inefficiency over here (CIBI).
*   **Conflicted Analysis:**
    *   A range-bound period is possible before a move to 15126.5.
    *   However, no trades will be taken until the inefficiency is broken.
*   **Market Manipulation:** The stock market is perceived as being manipulated, particularly for political reasons.
    *   Share prices are considered unwarranted.
*   **Trading Implication:**
    *   Conflicted higher timeframe narratives force short-term trading approaches.
    *   Precision is critical, allowing for potentially one entry.
*   **One Minute Time Frame:**
    *   Potentially more opportunities, but requires experience and nimbleness.
*   **Next Week Outlook:**
    *   Not excited about trading until the buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency is broken.

*   **Hourly Chart:**
    *   Ran the buy side into a **bearish order block (BOB)**.
    *   Broke down.
    *   Swept the sell side.
    *   Entered the buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency and rolled over after an **institutional order entry drill**.
    *   Went through half of the daily buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency, which is the consequent encroachment level, the midpoint between the lower and higher level of the daily buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency.
*   Gave levels on Twitter Thursday 15,185.25 and 15,175.
    *   The bodies respected these levels and wicked through them.
    *   15,175 is the candle here.
        *   This is the buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency between this candle's high and low.
    *   15,185.25 is the daily buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency 25% quadrant.
        *   A 25% quadrant level from the buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency is calculated by dividing the buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency into quarters.
        *   The lower quadrant is what price respected on Thursday
*   **Algorithmic signatures are important to understand.**
*   Market rallies off of that on Thursday comes back in and re-trades back to the consequent encroachment midpoint, then sends us back up to the high end of the daily BISI/SI high.
*   **15-Minute Time Frame:** Gnarly trading range on Friday and Thursday.
    *   Nimbleness and lower timeframe analysis is needed.
    *   Take profits quickly and avoid forcing trades.

## **NASDAQ (NQ) - 1 Minute Candlestick Chart Strategy: Inversion Fair Value Gap (IFVG)**

*   This employs the previously taught inversion fair value gap concept.
*   **Fair Value Gap (FVG) Definition:** An actual inefficiency, not simply a support or resistance level.
    *   A single candle passing up without overlapping candles on the downside.
    *   Lacking sell-side delivery.
    *   Part of a swing low and expected redelivery.
*   **IFVG Selection:**
    *   Employs time and price.
    *   Uses institutional market structure (not classic higher high/lower low patterns).
    *   Requires understanding the grand scheme of things.
*   Price was already trending down towards redelivery on the buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency low.
*   **Fulcrum Point:** An IFVG is a fulcrum point, it can be projected down.
*   **Redelivery:** The market efficiently delivers sell-side delivery to this level here.
    *   **Sell-Side Delivery vs. Sell-Side Liquidity:** Sell-side delivery is the market going lower and booking price on the downside.
*   **Range Definition:** Between the high and low of the daily buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency.
*   **Premium/Discount Ranges:** Half of the range from the buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency high to the low is used to define premium (above) and discount (below) levels.
    *   **Bearish Approach:** Ideally, selling short in the premium range with the expectation of reaching the lower half, and ultimately delivering perfectly to the lower level.
*   **Quadrant Price Levels:**
    *   Instead of zones, lower quadrant price levels are used.
    *   Calculated from the half of the range on the bid-side imbalance sell-side efficiency on the daily chart.
*   **Tuesday August 29, 2023 10 a.m. 1 hour BISI/SI low and the use in price.**
*   **It's a matter of finding it in the chart and also following**


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining all details, context, and nuances while improving readability, grammar, and coherence.

## **Narrative and Application of Inversion Fair Value Gaps (IFVG)**

This section details the narrative behind using a specific Fair Value Gap (FVG) and how it's applied in a trading model.

### **Understanding the Narrative**

*   **Premium Context:** We are in a premium, expecting the price to decline.
*   **Fair Value Gap Interest:** Interest is in this particular FVG because the price is expected to roll over. It previously broke below, but short selling there is avoided, as time is a more significant factor.
*   **Avoiding Early Participation:** When price is rising, avoid chasing it or being an early participant.
*   **Time Sensitivity:** Wait for the 8:00 timeframe, which is a crucial reference point. The market trades back down through it.
*   **Not Supply and Demand:** This is not based on supply and demand. Instead, the analysis focuses on specific candles and price levels.
*   **Superiority Complex:** Some viewers may mistakenly assume this is about supply and demand due to the use of rectangles on the chart, but it is not. The focus is on a specific candle and its price levels.
*   **Specific Candle Reference:** The analysis always refers back to that specific candle and its price levels. The market trades up to that level.
*   **Time Influence:** Because of time, that level is expected to have an influential impact on the price. Does it send the price lower? Yes.
*   **Repeat Visits:** It comes back up and hits it again. Does it go through it again? No, it is stopped because it is referring right back to that price point.
*   **Bullish Scenario:** If this were a fair value gap, and the outlook was bullish, there would be interest in buying when it goes down into it, or if it went down through it and came back above it.
*   **Reclaimed Discount Array:** If the price goes down through it, and comes back above it, now it is treated as a reclaimed discount array.
*   **PD Array Focus:** Looking through candlesticks to identify a specific PD array.
*   **Narrative Application:** Applying narrative, which is challenging to teach, because it is learned conceptually through repeated experience.
*   **No One-Size-Fits-All:** A single, comprehensive video cannot answer all questions in one view.
*   **Inversion Fair Value Gap Approach:** This approach to using an inversion fair value Gap differs from a standard bullish scenario.

### **Bearish Expectations**

*   **Daily Chart Expectation:** Because in a premium, the expectation is to be short. The expectation is that the big bullish green candle on the daily chart will be re-delivered to the downside.
*   **First Level Targets:** The first level being targeted is the halfway point and the quadrant – specifically the lower 25%.
*   **Hourly Chart Reference:** This level digging into the hourly chart buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency (BISI/SI)

### **"M.M." Model Explanation**

*   **M.M. Slang:** M.M. is slang for M2 machine gun and is a way to classify things.
*   **PD Array Inventory:** There are 81 different PD arrays.
*   **Versatile PD Arrays:** There are several things that can be done with each one of those PD arrays.
*   **Inversion Fair Value Gap Model:** This is simply an inversion fair value Gap; the way that fair value Gap is used is a model.
*   **Inefficiency Criteria:** If there is an inefficiency as outlined here between the daily buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency (BISI/SI) high and low, the outlook is bearish, looking for lower prices.
*   **Market Structure Agreement:** With Market structure in agreement and with the time of price, the expectation is that 8:30 delivery will occur.

### **Anticipating Market Moves**

*   **News Anticipation:** It is possible to get in here and use this and get ahead of - and enter before - the news.
*   **X-Ray View:** It's like an X-ray view that tips its hand and reveals what the market is likely to do.
*   **Inefficiency Trading:** The market trades up into the inefficiency, and at the delivery of the 8:30 news, we see it run away based on employment numbers.
*   **Targeting Levels:** Trading down into the lower 25% quadrant between this low and this high; the lower quarter or quadrant level is targeted.

### **Zoomed-In Analysis**

*   **Contextual IFVG:** The inversion fair value gap, within the context of expecting it to trade lower, should be considered.
*   **Profitability Requirement:** Best case scenario being the low of the daily BISI/SI for NASDAQ, but needing it not to do that to find profitability.
*   **Partial Profit Target:** This would be first partial at consequent encroachment.
*   **Additional Discount Array:** Let it run some more to get down to another discount array which was in close proximity, only 10 handles away, which was that hourly buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency (BISI/SI) low on this date and time on your hourly chart.

### **Model Implementation**

*   **Range Focus:** Focus on this range and how the inversion fair value gap is being employed there.
*   **Model Application:** This is a model that you can use; an inversion fair value Gap, when you are expecting price to run right back down into an inefficiency that was buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency (BISI/SI).
*   **Reversed Scenario:** This can be reversed when there is a sell-side imbalance buy-side inefficiency (SIBI) and the expectation is for price to go higher. The inversion fair value gap here would be something after a low, and it would trade back down to it and then send it higher.

### **Key Takeaways**

*   **Level Focus:** The analysis emphasizes that this level here and this level here on the hourly chart is this one singular candle.
*   **Thursday Anticipation:** On Thursday, the anticipation was the run down into at least the lower quadrant, the lower 25% between this and this.
*   **Levels Respectively:** Those levels are the respective low and high of the same candle.
*   **Inefficient Delivery:** The same way when going back down to redeliver over the inefficiency here, it was buy-side delivery, but now it needs sell-side delivery because it is inefficient in that regard.
*   **Candle Range:** The range defined by that candle – this low and that high – needs to have efficient delivery. That can only happen by having price go back down inside this entire range.
*   **Quadrant Levels:** Lower quadrant, halfway point.

### **Trade Execution**

*   **Bearish IFVG Scenario:** If you have an inversion fair value gap and you are bearish, expecting a news report, and it has tipped its hand to you, indicating a likely break lower in Market structure and lower time frames, you can anticipate the resulting drop.
*   **Premium to Discount:** Zoomed in inside that premium to discount.
*   **Second Opportunity:** Inversion per got my second opportunity to get into it again.
*   **Aggressive Break:** It breaks aggressively inefficiency once more at 8:30 employment numbers.
*   **Profit-Taking:** Runs aggressively, partial here, partial best case scenario would be if it would deliver to the low of the hourly, but mentioned real time to take profits, don't be greedy.
*   **Objective Achievement:** Went a little bit lower than the original objective on that particular day, but never got to the low of the daily buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency (BISI/SI), being this level here.

### **PD Array Applications**

*   **Market Structure Alignment:** You can apply every one of the PD arrays to specific elements of Market structure and how you anticipate price delivering.
*   **Plug and Play:** Plug and play each one of these PD arrays with the expectation that the model will deliver under a specific premise.
*   **Delivery Expectation:** The expectation for this level here to this level here is to be delivered with downside delivery.
*   **Non-Random Delivery:** The analysis emphasizes that the price delivery is not random and is not going to some random level; it is going to very specific price levels.
*   **Model Context:** The inversion fair value gap can be used in the context of the model is simply a model utilizing an inversion fair value gap.
*   **Core Context:** But it takes you right back to the core context of where you are in price, what is it likely to go to next, and are you in a short-term premium or short-term discount?

### **Bearish Premium Scenario**

*   **Discount Target:** If bearish and in a premium, you can anticipate price reaching down into a discount, but not some random level – very specific levels.
*   **Low Achievement:** It need not go to the best case scenario, which would be the low, which is still believed to be a possibility next week.
*   **Many S&P Reference:** The E-mini S&P 500 has already traded to its respective buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency (BISI/SI) for its daily chart.

# London Session Analysis: Algorithmic Delivery and Market Dynamics

This document breaks down a specific segment of a London session analysis, focusing on identifying patterns, algorithmic delivery, and market manipulation.

## I. Session Overview: Premium Runs and Target Identification

*   **Timing:** The speaker highlights two key timeframes for potential trading opportunities:
    *   **Afternoon:** Between 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM (EST).
*   **London Session Focus:** Today's session showcases the premium reaching a specific point.
*   **Three O'Clock Run:** The price run initiates around 3:00 AM (EST).
*   **Initial Target:** The market aims for sell-side liquidity resting below a certain point.
*   **Chart Clarity:** The speaker prefers to avoid excessive annotations to maintain a cleaner chart.

## II. Bearish Breaker Analysis

*   **Bearish Breaker Identification:** A bearish breaker is identified, characterized by a high, a low, and a higher high formation.
*   **Wick Significance:** The wick is highlighted due to the presence of buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency (BISI).
*   **Fair Value Gap Context:**
    *   **Up-Close Candle:** If the candle is up-close, it signals a buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency (BISI).
    *   **Down-Close Candle:** If the candle is down-close, it indicates a sell-side imbalance, buy-side inefficiency (SIBI).

## III. Market Dynamics and Boundaries

*   **Breaker Range Extension:** The range of a bearish breaker is extended forward, functioning as an inversion fair value gap.
*   **Indicator Limitations:** The speaker cautions against blindly relying on indicators like overbought/oversold or moving average crossovers.
    *   **Reason:** These tools may not provide the precision needed for anticipating price movements.
*   **Simple Market Dynamics:** The market adheres to specific dynamics and boundaries, predetermined unless manual intervention occurs.

## IV. Manual Intervention: Unexpected Disruptions

*   **Definition:** Manual intervention refers to unforeseen events that disrupt algorithmic price delivery.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Unexpected rate announcements.
    *   Geopolitical upheavals or terrorist attacks.
    *   Wartime events.
    *   Events like September 11th.
*   **Underlying Risk:** These unpredictable events represent the inherent risk in trading.
*   **Personal Responsibility:** The speaker emphasizes taking responsibility for losses resulting from incorrect price action readings or attempting to predict the market.

## V. Algorithmic Delivery vs. Manual Intervention

*   **Market's Algorithmic Nature:** The market operates based on algorithmic delivery, independent of indicators or supply/demand concepts.
*   **Real Market Makers:** The speaker distinguishes between dealers (those working within price delivery) and true "market makers" at the highest level of price origination.
*   **Transparency:** While the speaker cannot directly show the highest level of price origination, they aim to demonstrate how to understand and anticipate its movements.

## VI. Profitability and Risk Management

*   **Realistic Expectations:** The speaker discourages "Lambo lifestyle" expectations, advocating for a sober approach to trading.
*   **Pattern Recognition:** Success hinges on recognizing and understanding specific price action patterns.
*   **Alternative Approaches:** If other, simpler methods (including indicators) yield profitability and peace of mind, traders should stick with those.
*   **Self-Competition:** The speaker stresses that traders are primarily competing against themselves, not against other traders or perceived "gurus."
*   **Focus on Profitability:** The primary goal is consistent profitability, regardless of the methods used.
*   **Avoid Distractions:** Social media can be a distraction, tempting traders to constantly seek ways to outperform others instead of focusing on their own profitability.

## VII. Liquidity and Inefficiencies

*   **Liquidity Above Highs and Below Lows:** The market constantly moves to find liquidity above old highs and below old lows.
*   **Reasons for Market Movement:** The market moves for two main reasons:
    *   To target inefficiencies.
*   **Buy-Side Liquidity:**
    *   Once price trades above a short-term high, buy stops are triggered.
*   **Premium Range of Inefficiency:** The upper portion of a down-close candle represents the premium range of an inefficiency.
*   **Balanced Price Range Fair Value Gaps:**
    *   When looking at a fair value gap within a balanced price range, the speaker prefers that it doesn't trade to the upper portions.
*   **Bearish Expectations:** If expecting a bearish move, the speaker wants to see the inefficiency remain open.
*   **Sell-Side Targeting:** The goal is to see price run for sell-side liquidity, potentially trading into the 15-minute discount efficiency consequent encroachment.

## VIII. Narrative Building and Time-Based Algorithmic Delivery

*   **Coalescence of Factors:** The trading narrative is built by considering multiple factors, not just a single fair value gap or order block.
*   **Algorithmic Spooling:** "Spooling" refers to the directional price movement towards an inefficiency (e.g., a fair value gap).
    *   The speaker defines that price spooling is when the price starts running in One Direction.
*   **Buy-Side vs. Sell-Side Delivery:**
    *   **Buy-Side Delivery:** Price moves higher, targeting buy-side liquidity.
    *   **Sell-Side Delivery:** Price drops, aiming for sell-side liquidity.

## IX. Five-Minute Breaker and Discount Analysis

*   **Five-Minute Breaker Analysis:** The market breaks below a short-term low.
*   **New Gap:** A new gap is identified inside the five-minute breaker low, which should ideally stay open.
*   **Lower Timeframe Confirmation:** Dropping to a one-minute chart can provide more detail.
*   **Five-Minute Discount:** A five-minute discount buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency (BISI) is located inside the 15-minute buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency (BISI).
*   **Support Rejection:** The speaker wants to see the price hit the low and reject it, indicating support.
*   **Later-Day Premise:** If the price breaks below this point and continues lower, it negates the likelihood of targeting higher levels later in the day.
*   **Balanced Price Range:** The current price action is characterized as a balanced price range with back-and-forth delivery.

## X. One-Minute Chart and New Day Opening Gap

*   **Five-Minute Breaker Context:** The speaker refers to the back-and-forth price delivery within the five-minute breaker range.
*   **Run at 3:06:** A price run occurs at 3:06 AM (EST), dropping to the low of the new day opening gap.
*   **New Day Opening Gap Definition:** The new day opening gap is the difference between the closing price at 5:00 PM New York local time and the reopening price at 6:00 PM.
*   **Correction:** The speaker corrected a previously incorrect annotation on the chart during the live stream.

## XI. Breaker and Inversion Fair Value Gap

*   **Five-Minute Breaker Explanation:** The down-close candle inside the high, low, higher high formation is the bearish breaker on the one-minute chart, framed on the five-minute chart.
*   **Inversion Fair Value Gap:** The speaker advises viewers to identify the gap that acts as an inversion fair value gap on their own charts.
*   **Discount Targeting:** The anticipated draw is towards the discount five-minute level or the 15-minute discount buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency (BISI) consequent encroachment.

## XII. Bearish Order Block and Algorithmic Control

*   **Three O'Clock Touch:** At 3:00 AM (EST), the price perfectly touches the speaker's defined bearish order block.
*   **Bearish Order Block Definition:** A bearish order block is not a supply/demand zone, but a specific price level.
*   **Algorithmic Repetition:** The speaker asserts that the market is algorithmically delivered, causing patterns to repeat.
*   **Market Control:** The speaker claims the market is "absolutely 100 controlled."
*   **Gambling vs. Informed Trading:** Without understanding price action, trading becomes gambling.
*   **Risk Management for Beginners:** New traders should risk very little and expect losses in the early stages.

# London Session Analysis: Leveraging Breakers, Order Blocks, and Algorithmic Delivery

This analysis focuses on a specific segment of a London session, dissecting market behavior around breakers, order blocks, and algorithmic price delivery, while retaining the speaker's unique style and cautionary tone.

## I. The Pitfalls of Over-Leveraging and Fear-Based Trading

*   **Learning with Real Money (and High Leverage):** The speaker cautions against using maximum leverage to learn trading with real money.
    *   **Reason:** Creates fear, and "scared money doesn't make money."
*   **Avoiding Fear:** The core message is to avoid creating fear by risking too much too soon.

## II. Five-Minute Bearish Breaker and Up-Close Candle Analysis

*   **Context:** Inside a five-minute bearish breaker, the market trades up into a specific up-close candle.
*   **Real-Time Price Action:** Emphasis on paying attention to the lesson presented through real-time price action.
*   **3:07 AM (EST) Observation:** At 3:07 AM (EST), the market trades up into the five-minute bearish breaker (shaded area).
*   **Inversion Fair Value Gap:** It's trading to the low of the inversion fair value gap (to be drawn by the viewer on the five-minute chart).

## III. Debunking Order Block Misconceptions

*   **Wick Irrelevance:** The speaker dismisses the importance of the wick on the up-close candle.
*   **Up-Close Candle as Bearish Order Block:** The up-close candle is identified as a bearish order block.
*   **Two Occurrences on the One-Minute Chart:**
    1.  Trading to the breaker and inversion fair value gap on the five-minute timeframe.
    2.  Trading up into a bearish order block.
*   **Order Block Definition:** Rejects the notion that order blocks are simply engulfing candles.

## IV. Sell-Side Delivery and Price Runs

*   **Sell-Side Delivery at 3:00 AM (EST):** At 3:00 AM (EST), the price starts its run, seeking sell-side liquidity.
*   **Target:** Lower sell-side liquidity below old lows.
*   **Up-Close Candles in Sell-Side Delivery:** During sell-side delivery, the market creates up-close candles.
*   **Price Runs vs. Trending Markets:** The speaker prefers the term "price runs" over "trending market."
*   **Anticipating Lower Prices:** Expectation of price running to lower targets for a discount:
    *   To a fair value gap lower than market price.
    *   To a low or relative equal lows for sell-side liquidity.
*   **Short Position Management:** If short, the speaker doesn't panic during rallies but observes the first up-close candle during sell-side delivery.
*   **Breaking Below the Creating Candle:** After the 3:00 AM (EST) price run, breaking below the candle that initiated the move.
*   **Inversion Fair Value Gap as Resistance:** The speaker expects the inversion fair value gap to act as a resistance, attracting more shorts.
*   **Pyramiding Short Positions:** Smart money has the opportunity to add or pyramid more short positions.

## V. Debunking the "Silver Bullet" Myth

*   **Silver Bullet Opportunities:** The speaker identifies four potential "Silver Bullet" opportunities:
    *   3:00 AM - 4:00 AM (EST)
    *   10:00 AM - 11:00 AM (EST)
    *   2:00 PM - 3:00 PM (EST)
    *   3:00 PM - 4:00 PM (EST)
*   **Focus on Price Action:** The speaker urges listeners to focus on price action during these times.
*   **Truth in the Framework:** The speaker asserts that the framework outlined is based on truth, not mythology or animal patterns.

## VI. Timeframe Agnosticism and Price Interpretation

*   **One-Minute Chart:** The current analysis is based on the one-minute chart.
*   **Comfort with Lower Timeframes:** Addresses discomfort with lower timeframes (30-second, etc.).
    *   **Argument:** It's the same price action as higher timeframes, just requires knowing how to read it.
*   **Price Reflection Across Timeframes:** The same market price is reflected on an hourly candlestick as on a one-second chart.
*   **Understanding Price Movement:** Emphasis on understanding where price is likely to go and where it's been.

## VII. Unfiltered Commentary and New Day Opening Gap Analysis

*   **Live Commentary Disclaimer:** Apologizes for potentially offensive language due to the unfiltered nature of live commentary.
*   **New Day Opening Gap:** The speaker identifies the new day opening gap high and low.
*   **Up-Close Candle Placement:** The up-close candle is in the premium side of the new day opening gap.

# Market Analysis, Trading Strategies, and Algorithmic Insights

This section delves into the speaker's market analysis techniques, trading strategies, and insights into algorithmic market behavior. The speaker discusses specific trading setups, the importance of understanding market inefficiencies, and how to identify potential areas of liquidity. He also addresses common criticisms and misconceptions about his approach.

## I. Addressing Spelling Concerns and Trading Challenges

*   **Spelling Accuracy:** The speaker prefaces the session by addressing potential spelling errors. "About spelling something correctly I'm keeping out of my way managing it you know did I say it right."
*   **SIBI/BISI Confusion:** He acknowledges potential past misspellings, specifically confusing SIBI (Sell-Side Imbalance Buy-Side Inefficiency) with BISI (Buy-Side Imbalance Sell-Side Inefficiency). "Because sometimes in the past I've called a sibia busy um because I'm doing it on one second no not sorry I'm usually doing it like on a one minute chart or sometimes on a second chart."
*   **Multi-Tasking Demands:** The speaker emphasizes the complexity of his live trading environment.
    *   **Simultaneous Tasks:** Articulating thoughts, typing, and managing trades with real money. "I have to think about what it is I'm trying to do think about how I want to articulate it to you type it out and all at the same time manage the trade real money so it's it's a whole lot going on folks."
    *   **Focus and Challenges**: The speaker highlights the level of focus required, especially given personal difficulties. "Some of you that are highly critical of me don't really appreciate the level of Focus that's required and that's challenging for me with someone that has the difficulties I have sometimes I'm focusing."
*   **Notepad Trading:** The speaker explains his ability to trade using only a notepad with key levels.
    *   **Trading without Live Charts:** He claims he can trade using a notepad and the ticker tape on CNBC. "These levels are simply written on a notepad so when I say I I can trade which is a notepad I don't need to see a live chart I can look at the ticker tape on the bottom of CNBC every 10 minutes I could look at that and trade off that because I'm watching time I'm watching time."
    *   **Focus on Time:** He emphasizes that time is the primary factor, not the highest high or lowest low of recent candles. "I don't need to know what the highest high and lowest low the last one minute candle the last five minutes I don't that's all that's all extra that just makes it even better for me."
    *   **Initial Key Information:** In the beginning of the session, he only needs to know the previous high and low and the range. "In the beginning of the session all I need to know is what's the previous high and low what's the range I'm looking at well that's this candle right here this candle is low this candle is high that's my premium range those two levels."
    *   **Post 3:00 PM Expectations:** He looks for price to stay below that after three o'clock and gravitate to and through a fair value gap. "I want to see price stay below that after three o'clock and then I want to see how we gravitate to and through this fair value got right here."

## II. Chart Overlay and Level Transparency

*   **Fair Value Gap Overlay:** The speaker will overlay the inversion fair value gap at the end of the stream. "I'm going to show you this overlay of the inversion favorite you got before I end the string that way you can test yourself and see that your chart shows what it is you should be seeing."
*   **Notepad Contents Revealed:** The speaker indicates his notepad contains the same levels highlighted on the chart, along with their descriptions. "All of these levels here that you're seeing highlighted over here just in the same order that's listed here that's what my notepad is just those levels and then what what they are like I'm showing right here."
*   **Transparency:** He claims to be transparent about his trading approach, contrasting it with others who keep their methods secret. "It's not like I'm hiding some kind of secret recipe on a notepad ICT doesn't ever show us his worksheet well it's I am actually I'm showing you where it is and where it's derived from on the charts when I'm pointing out certain things."

## III. Contract Rollover and September Trade Review

*   **Contract Rollover Announcement:** The speaker announces he has rolled over to the December contract. "The other day I'm pointing out the levels over here by the way I'm I rolled over to December today so yesterday you saw I took a live trade in NASDAQ traded with the September delivery contract for 2023. I'm now following and only focusing on the December contract."
*   **December Contract Symbol:** The symbol for the December NASDAQ contract is NQZ2023. "The symbol for this is here NQ z2023 so if you're looking at es it would be es z2023."
*   **Potential September Contract Transition:** The sell-off might have been better suited for the September contract he was previously using. "Over here this sell-off in here I'd probably be better Suited transitioning to the September contract because that's what I was using."
*   **Wednesday, September 6th, SIBI:** The speaker references a SIBI on the 15-minute timeframe from Wednesday, September 6th. "Here's the business on yesterday's trade what I was working with and with the information was in my charts all right so you can see this sibi here on the 15 minute time frame this is from Wednesday September 6th and this inefficiency from this candle is low."
*   **Engagement Request:** The speaker requests viewers to hit the thumbs up button. "If you're enjoying this if it's been helpful to you I would greatly appreciate you taking a second to hit the thumbs up it does encourage me it doesn't make me any more money and your thumbs down don't really hurt my feelings because it's not a big deal."
*   **Critical Viewers:** Alludes to a consistent group of negative viewers. "I know it's the same 15 guys from Texas side pocket accounts."
*   **SIBI Target:** Mentions that he felt the market could drop up into a Sell-Side Imbalance Buy-Side Inefficiency (SIBI). "The sell side and balanced by side and efficiency here that was what was shaded and you saw when I shared the result of the trade I felt that we could drop up into that."
*   **Inefficiency Location:** Driving up into this inefficiency would be above all the order flow. "So driving up into this would be above all this order flow here and the only inefficiency above price yesterday was this area in here."

## IV. Daily Chart Analysis and Trade Considerations

*   **Daily Chart Inefficiency:** Speaker mentions he wasn't interested in trading until the market moved outside a buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency on the daily chart. "If you remember the I don't know if I did a live stream or the pre-recorded session but the last video commentary I did I told you that I'm not interested in trading until we get outside of this buy side imbalance cell sign efficiency right in here from the daily chart okay so let me let me take this off for a second and go to the daily chart and I'll show you what I'm talking about."
*   **Wish for Early Access:** Expresses a wish he had access to this type of information earlier in his trading career. "Man I wish I had this coming up as a Trader this is something that would have been very useful to me."
*   **Inefficiency Definition:** Defines the inefficiency as the range between the high and low of a specific candle. "This candle's High this candle is low so this one big candle right here that's the buy side of balance outside efficiency I said I would not be really all that interested in trading until we get on the outside of the by side balance outside efficiency meaning it would have to get above this low of that candle or the uh below this high of that candle and yesterday we did that."
*   **Repulsion from Inefficiency:** The speaker observed the market repelling from the daily inefficiency after returning home. "I wanted to see after I got home if we went back inside the Box on balance outside efficiency or if we repelled from it you can see we repel from it."
*   **Patience and Contentment:** Shared a sentiment of being content with "enough" and not needing to do anything else. "My concern was and this is what I shared in uh I don't remember if I tweeted it or if it was just in Patrick Whelan's uh live stream but I I know I posted be content with enough and just don't worry about doing anything else."
*   **Consolidation as Support:** Notes that consolidation with a higher timeframe array (daily BISI) acts as a support factor. "As soon as it starts doing this consolidation stuff like this with a higher time frame array like it is here the daily bus and about cell sign efficiency High that's a real support Factor and if you start seeing elements of it not wanting to go below that and they only went below it just to get into the inefficiencies over here."
*   **Efficient Delivery:** Explains that the price drop into the inefficiency was to efficiently deliver price. "It makes perfect sense for it to drop down into that because it had to clean up this little inefficiency now it's efficiently delivered and then now you see it aggressively run higher."
*   **Missed Opportunity:** Mentions he would have traded the decline if he had been in front of the charts. "I wasn't in front of the charts to be able to see all this stuff or anticipate how it behaved I would have been all over it right in this decline right there I'm getting a lot of timeframes I'll tell you why."

## V. Single-Candle Delivery vs. Time-Based Delivery

*   **Reason for the Decline:** Below the buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency high on the daily chart, the price drops to reprice an area needing efficient repricing. "Below this by Center balance cell sign efficiency high on the daily chart it drops down into this area because this is the only area below this level that needed to be efficiently repriced to."
*   **Single Candle vs. Multiple Candle Delivery:** Differentiates between single-candle delivery (impulsive move) and time-based delivery (price moving back and forth).
    *   **Single Candle Impulsive Move:** This is one single candle that was moved higher versus something like this this candle that is right above my cursor over here that candle is high in its entire range."
    *   **Time-Based Delivery:** "Then this candle here it's moved back and forth between those two price levels and then we started this candle here and it ran away and then we had one single delivery of upside or by side delivery on that one candle meaning that this went back and forth here then left it so this is more efficiently delivered because it spent more time going back and forth in between that shaded area whereas this candle only has one individual impulsive price move and it was directional it went higher and it's all one single encapsulation of buy side delivery one candle movement only since it created that candle until we traded down into it over here price never overlapped in that range at all it's running and running and running running."
*   **Deferred Rebalance (Fair Value Gap):** Describes a fair value gap as a deferred rebalance. "This is a deferred rebalance a fair value Gap is a deferred rebalance it's going to be referred to in a future time it'll reprice back to it at a later time so it's a deferred redelivery versus a immediate rebalance."
*   **Immediate Rebalance:** Explains the "immediate rebalance" concept, signifying strong upside potential.
    *   **Immediate Rebalance Scenario:** "Whereas if you have something like this and say this candle here opened up and traded immediately Deck Down in the same candle after the one impulsive candle like this right here the next candle if it opened and traded down the previous candles High if I saw that and I'm bullish that's what I call my immediate rebalance."
    *   **Strongest Acceleration**: Claims it is one of the strongest times to see acceleration price magnitude to the upside. "That is one of the strongest absolutely strongest time the Murph the time to Market perfectly when you're going to see acceleration price magnitude to the upside it will be the very candle or the immediately next candle."
    *   **Consolidation or Reversal:** If it doesn't run by the next candle, expect consolidation or reversal. "If it doesn't do it by the next candle after the immediate rebalance you're going to consolidate or reverse."

*   **Liquidity Pool Recognition:** Identifies the larger pool of liquidity near the daily inefficiency. "So this is the larger pool of liquidity and it also is just in the same proximity of that daily biosynomial cell side and efficiency High so it's reasonable to anticipate to trade back down that level by in and of itself but then you have the agreement also that there's relative equal lows down there so there's going to be real orders cell stops below there."
*   **Rigged Market Narrative:** The speaker reinforces his view that the market is rigged, creating opportunities for those "in the know." "If it is for the sake of our discussion today and every time we sit down if the market is rigged and it goes up to allow people that are in the know that's all part of the club that you're not a part of okay I'm teaching you how to get into the back door but you're not a card-carrying member of that club."

*   **Removing Standard Deviations:** The speaker removes standard deviations from the chart to avoid distractions.
*   **Color Coding:** The speaker changes the color of the inefficiency indicator to white for better visibility.
*   **Sell-Side Imbalance Buy-Side Inefficiency (SIBI):** The focus is on the 15-minute SIBI.

### B. Contextualizing with the 5-Minute Chart

*   **SIBI Confirmation:** The speaker observes the 15-minute SIBI on the 5-minute chart, specifically noting market behavior around it at 9:30 AM.
*   **Body Respect:** The speaker checks to ensure that the "bodies" (candle bodies) are respecting the 15-minute SIBI.
    *   Is the price "wicking" into it? Yes.
    *   Does it pierce or breach the halfway point? No.
    *   Does it break down below the up-close candle? Yes.

### C. Algorithmic Confirmation and Bearish Narrative

*   **Algorithmic Nature:** The speaker attributes the observed behavior to algorithmic market actions.
*   **Bearish Sentiment:** The inability to move above or even touch the halfway point of the SIBI reinforces the bearish sentiment.

### D. Candle Close Analysis

*   **Staying Outside the SIBI:** The speaker wants to see if the candle closes below and outside the SIBI on the 15-minute timeframe.
*   **Continuation Expectations:** The speaker expects that the next candle should not rally above the high of the SIBI, or if it does, it should stop at the 50% level.
*   **Invalidation of Bearish Stance:** If the price moves above the 50% level of the SIBI, the bearish stance is either put on the "back burner" or the trader must be prepared to accept a loss and wait for more information.

### E. Moving to the One-Minute Chart

*   **Further Refinement:** The speaker moves to the one-minute chart for further analysis.

## II. Opening Range Gap (ORG) Analysis

*   **Opening Range Gap Defined:** The speaker highlights a box that indicates the opening range gap.
*   **Regular Trading Hours (RTH) vs. Electronic Trading Hours (ETH):** The speaker differentiates between regular trading hours and electronic trading hours.
*   **Technicality Note:** The speaker mentions that technically, the closing price should be used, but when prices are close, he uses the high for simplicity.

### A. Judas Swing

*   **False Rally:** The run-up into the 15-minute SIBI is labeled as a "Judas Swing," designed to mislead traders.
*   **Bullish Deception:** It looks bullish and encourages people to believe the price will go higher.

### B. Exploiting Public Sentiment

*   **Chat Window Indicator:** The speaker finds live streamers' chat windows valuable as a public sentiment indicator.
*   **Contrarian Approach:** If many viewers are actively bullish in the chat windows when the speaker anticipates weakness, it's a positive sign.

*   **Defining the Opening Range Gap:** The speaker uses a regular trading hour session chart to define the opening range gap.
*   **4:15 PM Close:** The speaker uses the 4:15 PM close (end of settlement) to determine the gap.
*   **Monday Exception:** On Mondays, the gap is calculated from the 4:15 PM close on Friday to the Monday opening at 9:30 AM.

### D. Liquidity Void vs. Inefficiency (Fair Value Gap)

*   **Liquidity Void:** The speaker distinguishes the opening range gap as a "real liquidity void," indicating a lack of trading activity between those price points.
*   **Fair Value Gap (FVG):** The speaker notes that a fair value gap, in the form of a sell-side imbalance buy-side inefficiency, is not a liquidity void.

### E. Market Gravitation

*   **Reversion Expectation:** The speaker expects that the market will likely want to gravitate back down into the opening range gap.
*   **Chart Templates:** The speaker advises creating chart templates specifically for tracking opening range gaps.

### F. Gap Management

*   **Tracking and Aging:** The speaker changes the color of the opening range gap as it ages and is closed.
*   **Price Respect:** The speaker continues to monitor how price respects the gap.
*   **Time Sensitivity:** Opening range gaps are most effective for about a month, sometimes a month and a half, and then expire.
*   **Resource Utility:** Opening range gaps should be tracked in a specific template rather than on every chart.

### G. Opening Range Gap Levels

*   **Key Levels:** The speaker emphasizes that the high, upper quadrant, midpoint, lower quadrant, and low of the opening range gap are extremely precise price levels.
*   **Bullish Scenario:** If the market is bullish and trades back down into the opening range gap, the speaker would anticipate the high, upper quadrant, or midpoint to act as levels of sensitivity.
*   **Convergence:** This is in combination with other PD arrays (Price Delivery Arrays) in close convergence, at the right time of day.
*   **Model 2022/Silver Bullet Entry:** These gaps are also used for Model 2022 or Silver Bullet entries.

### C. Missed Opportunity

*   **Short Entry:** The speaker wanted to see the market trade up to 15,413 to add to a short position but was off by one tick.

### D. Change in the State of Delivery (Order Block)

*   **Defining Change in Delivery:** It's not about engulfing or candle size, but about opening or closing higher or lower after a transitional event.
*   **Transitional Events:** These include liquidity sweeps or revisiting inefficiencies.

### E. Order Block Definition

*   **Order Block:** A specific price level based on time and sales data.
*   **No Reliance on Deceptive Data:** Has nothing to do with Level 2 data, order book, or book map.

*   Explaining that even if intraday trades are initially incorrect, the underlying weekly bias can provide a safety net.
*   Using the example of a session between **7:00 AM and 9:00 AM** (unspecified timezone).
*   Suggesting that if the weekly chart indicates a likely upward movement, traders should focus on bullish setups (e.g., market trading down to a buy-side imbalance or below a short-term low).
*   Highlighting the importance of SMT (Smart Money Technique) divergence.

### **Simplified Trading Model**

*   Stressing that traders don't need to incorporate every single concept taught.
*   Emphasizing the need for a premise based on a higher time frame (weekly chart) to establish a bias.
*   Using the example of the Dollar Index potentially moving towards **105.883**.
*   If this scenario seems likely, traders should anticipate weakness or sell setups in currency pairs like **EUR/USD, GBP/USD, AUD/USD, and NZD/USD**.

### **Trading with the Opening Price**

*   For position traders unable to monitor lower time frames, trading with the opening price is an option.
*   Using either the Asia opening session price, or London.
*   Ideally, the price should trade lower first, then move higher above the opening price (buy strength).

### **Session Trading Examples and Risk Management**

*   Using the example of trading between **7:00 AM and 9:00 AM New York time** as a hypothetical scenario.
*   Stressing that the Dollar Index is used as a barometer, not a directly traded instrument (due to its thinness).
*   Dollar up = Risk off, Dollar down = Risk on.
*   New Traders should be trading risk off.
*   **Risk-off** environments typically make it difficult for other assets to rally, while **risk-on** environments allow for rallies in equities and foreign currencies.

### **Pattern Recognition vs. Market Understanding**

*   Highlighting that pattern recognition and indicators are the least important factors in timing.
*   Referencing recent examples of successful live trades with precision.
*   Emphasizing that the same logic applies to both demo and real money trading.
*   Reiterating that if the expectation is for the dollar to rise, then other assets should fall, and traders should focus on setups within their defined time window.

### **Concluding Remarks**

*   Noted the Asian Session isn't ideal, without explanation.


Okay, here's the organized and detailed version of the provided text, maintaining its original intent and tone while improving readability and structure:

# Market Analysis and Trading Strategies: A Deep Dive (Continued)

## Asia Session Trading and Market Dynamics

*   Acknowledging insufficient movement in the Asian session to confidently recommend spending time trading.
*   Exceptions: potential news drivers from Asian markets like the **Japanese Yen, Kiwi (New Zealand Dollar), or Australian Dollar** when their markets come online.
*   Correcting the Misconception about Wellington:

    *   Dismissing the notion that the financial day technically begins in Wellington.
    *   Asserting that the new day starts at **New York midnight**, influencing subsequent market activity.
    *   Describing London as a carryover from the previous New York session, not the true start of the day.
    *   Emphasizing that algorithms recognize this pattern as a mechanism for day-to-day transactions.

## Challenging Conventional Wisdom and Industry Narratives

*   Critiquing industry figures on **CNBC** whose advice often fails to materialize, despite their titles and institutional affiliations.
*   Encouraging a shift in thinking and a critical evaluation of market narratives.

## Streamlining Trading Focus and Correlation Analysis

*   Suggesting limiting focus to two markets to avoid diluting attention, especially when holding a specific bias on the dollar.
*   Sharing a Personal Anecdote: admitting to having traded 28 currency pairs in his youth, driven by a fear of missing opportunities.
*   Differentiating between Seeking Excuses and Strategic Trading: emphasizing the importance of waiting for proper setups instead of compulsively engaging in numerous markets.
*   Highlighting the Correlation between **EUR/USD (Euro/Dollar) and GBP/USD (Pound/Dollar)**:

    *   Noting that these pairs usually move in tandem (though not always).
    *   Stating that correlation is advantageous for analysis and trading decisions.
    *   Explaining that this correlation is usually diametrically opposed to the **Dollar Index**.
*   Reiterating that this is basic market theory but often overlooked by beginners.

## Leveraging SMT Divergence for High-Probability Setups

*   Suggesting that, with a bullish dollar bias, traders should anticipate sell signals in **EUR/USD** and **GBP/USD**.
*   Using SMT (Smart Money Technique) Divergence:
    *   Observing short-term highs between Euro and Pound.
    *   Identifying a failure to make a higher high in one currency while the other does.
*   Presenting a Logical Approach: deriving a bias from a higher timeframe, focusing on correlated instruments, and using SMT divergence.
*   Recommending EUR/USD and GBP/USD as prime tradable instruments when the dollar is expected to rise.
*   Cautioning against Focusing Solely on EUR/USD: stressing the need to monitor closely correlated instruments for confirming signals.

## Practical Application: EUR/USD Example on Forex.com

*   Referencing Forex.com's data feed: noting his consistent use of it since he began teaching, without endorsing it as a broker.
*   Illustrating a Bullish Dollar Scenario: explaining that a bullish outlook on the dollar warrants focusing on short selling opportunities in EUR/USD and GBP/USD.
*   Applicability to Index Futures: clarifying that the same principles apply to index futures trading.

## Comparative Market Analysis and Decoupling

*   Highlighting the Constant Comparison of Indices: always examining **S&P 500 (SPX) and NASDAQ (NDX)**, looking at their candlestick patterns, relative highs and lows, and overall behavior.
*   Defining Decoupling: asymmetrical market movement where assets don't move in the expected correlated manner.
*   Emphasizing the Advantage of Monitoring Correlated Markets: revealing false moves by identifying when one market fails to confirm the move of another.

## Reinforcing High-Probability Trading Principles

*   Stressing the Importance of Aligning Setups with Weekly Expectations: only framing trades that align with the overall weekly bias.
*   Diametrical Opposition as a Core Requirement:

    *   Reiterating that high-probability trading requires the market being traded to be diametrically opposed to the Dollar Index.
    *   Emphasizing that this initial alignment is essential.
*   Intraday Scalping as an Alternative: acknowledging that trades can still be taken when this opposition isn't present, but they're best suited for scalping.
*   Patience as a Virtue: advising traders to wait for opportunities that align with their bias when the market doesn't initially present them.
*   Currency Trading Rules: emphasizing the need for the currency or currencies to be bearish.

## Avoiding Contradictory Signals and Impulsive Decisions

*   Warning Against Framing Buy Signals in Bearish Scenarios: urging traders not to justify buying when the overall expectation is bearish.
*   Condemning Impulsive Trading Decisions: cautioning against basing trades on arbitrary reasons, such as emotional reactions or unfounded assumptions.
*   Emphasizing the Need for Logical Justification: framing trades based on sound reasoning and analysis.

## The Essence of High-Probability Trading

*   High Probability Requires Avoiding Conflicting Scenarios: If buy OR sell setups can be seen, you are not at a high probability for trade.
*   Describing the Two-Pronged Approach:
    *   The market must be diametrically opposed to the Dollar Index.
    *   It should be next to impossible to argue for a counter-trend move.

## Understanding Market Dynamics in Risk-Off Environments

*   Relating Index Trading to Risk Sentiment: suggesting that in risk-off environments (dollar strength), rallies in indices are likely unsustainable.
*   Explaining the Purpose of Rallies: to reprice to an inefficiency or to run buy stops.
*   Asserting the Core Drivers of Market Movement: engagement of sentiment, disrupting the present market.
*   Defining Market Manipulation: creating or removing liquidity to unseat traders and reprice for institutional benefit.

*   Testament to Success: pointing to the success of his students worldwide as proof of the effectiveness of his teachings.
*   Assuring the Continued Relevance of the Approach: confirming that as long as market accessibility remains, the principles will hold true.
*   Addressing a Catastrophic Scenario: acknowledging that only a complete market shutdown would render the strategies obsolete.
*    Dismissing Concerns and focusing on the present opportunities.

## Navigating the Initial Stages of Trading

*   Avoiding Overthinking and "What If" Scenarios: discouraging dwelling on potential negative outcomes or market failures.
*   Reinforcing the Importance of Focused Analysis: stating that setups that can be seen on both sides of the market should be avoided.

# Algorithmic High-Frequency Trading Entry Strategy

## Initial Setup and Order Block Analysis

*   **Video URL:** <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjnir-o4rsQ>
*   We're focusing on an algorithmic high-frequency trading entry strategy.
*   The market is expected to return to a specific **order block**.
*   **Action:** Watch the order block. If the price trades down and touches it again, a long position will be initiated.
*   This is considered a change in the "state of delivery."
*   **Stop-Loss:** Place the stop-loss below the mean threshold.
*   Targeting approximately $170 in profit.

## Refining Entry on a Lower Timeframe

*   With the foundation of a "low, high, lower low" established inside the range of a specific candle, we can refine the entry.
*   **Action:** Drop down to a 15-second chart.
*   Avoid the price taking out the high *before* the entry.
*   Missed catching the initial drop due to being "too slow on the draw."
*   Observed an **immediate rebalance**.
*   As the market rises, it should build momentum outside of the **breaker**.
    *   The breaker is the sell-side liquidity resting below a low.
*   Observed another immediate rebalance (mouse trouble noted).
*   Stop-loss remains below.

## Scaling into the Position

*   The return to the previous level is viewed positively.
*   **Action:** Add one more contract.
*   The total risk is very small at $310.
*   Noted a gap up in price.
*   **Action:** Add one more contract if the price comes down and closes that gap.
*   Just touched the order block (the impression is that it wants to go higher).

## Implementing the Breaker Touch

*   Now positioned in the trade.
*   **Action:** Use the "breaker touch" as a possible entry point (if the price reaches it).
*   **Action:** Switch back to a 1-minute chart.
*   Targeting the volume imbalance.
*   The goal is to illustrate algorithmic price delivery, without requiring "Jumanji patterns" or "harmonic animal patterns."
*   Lines on the chart are being cleaned up.
*   Touched the bottom of the previous level again.
*   **Action:** Add one more contract.
*   Now have $1100 invested with $575 at risk.
*   Once the price clears a specific level, move the stop-loss right underneath the breaker.
*   There should be no reason for the price to go back below the breaker once it clears the structure.

## Partial Profit Taking Strategy

*   A high exists that can be used for a partial profit-taking strategy.
*   **Options:**
    *   Place a settlement order at or just above this price level to take off a certain number of contracts.
    *   Example: With five contracts, take one off at the first high, another at a higher level, and the balance at the final target.
*   Not even required to trade above the initial high, which provides flexibility.
*   The focus is on price movement, not necessarily achieving the entire target.
*   Touching the order block again.
*   Anticipate acceleration to the upside, potentially in the current or next candle.

## Understanding the Breaker and Friday Market Dynamics

*   Entering inside of the breaker.
*   **Breaker Definition:** The highest up-close candle in the swing prior to a lower low being met.
*   Not focused on relative equal lows at this time.
*   It's Friday, so there's a likelihood of running up against buy stops.
*   People may chase the price higher.
*   The current target is a "best-case scenario" and may not be fully reached.
*   Those high levels would be good ideas for partial profit taking.

## Setting Limit Orders for Partial Exits

*   **How to set limit orders:**
    1.  Position the cursor at the desired price level.
    2.  Right-click.
    3.  Select "Trade."
    4.  Choose "Sell Limit Order" for one contract.
    5.  Repeat at the higher price level.
*   The balance of contracts will automatically adjust (e.g., from five to three).
*   Once the high is taken out again, the stop-loss will be moved right below that low.
*   The price shouldn't go below the breaker again once a structure high has been broken.

## Stop-Loss Adjustment and Additional Entry

*   It's almost 8:00 AM in New York.
*   Watching for the orders to be filled and booked as prices are hit.
*   The stop is being rolled.
*   Now have $300 at risk.
*   Essentially using the mean threshold of the bullish breaker (which has already been met).
*   A trading away come back down, this will be a good area to add on one more just for the sake of completion.
*   Demonstrates the rationale behind pyramiding.
*   This strategy is not based on Wyckoff, supply and demand, Gann, Hurst, or Elliott Wave.

## Continued Market Analysis and Final Entry

*   Watching the wick; it shouldn't breach a certain level and should accelerate upwards.
*   Best-case scenario: The price just runs away right now.
*   Holding six contracts with $365 at risk (very minuscule).
*   Even in a "rather sloppy marking condition," the price is expected to move.
*   Consequent encouragement.
*   The current price level is also a long opportunity.
*   **Action:** Buy one more contract if the wick gets touched again, to prove that the concept is still valid for further upward movement.
*   The market is underneath a buy program.
*   One more contract has been added.

## Stop-Loss Placement and Risk Management Philosophy

*   Focus on stop placement, which is under this low.
*   The price can touch the breaker again or even tick slightly below it (a "Mohawk"), which is acceptable.
*   No excitement or nervousness is felt.
*   **If Wrong:** The stop-loss will protect the underlying equity.

## Final Observations

*   Observed expansion off the mean threshold.
*   This concludes the trading example.
*   "That my friends is how Mr. Rogers makes his neighborhood."
*   Closing remarks.

Okay, here's the organized and refined version of the provided text, adhering to all instructions:

# **Market Analysis: Hindsight, Future Predictions, and Trading Strategies**

## **Revisiting Past Analysis and Predicting Future Price Movements**

*   "This for the first time, this is all hindsight" - Addressing this sentiment directly.
*   It's **not** all hindsight.
*   The speaker emphasizes that prior discussions covered these market movements **before** they even occurred.
*   These discussions included specific price targets and directional movements, all visible on daily charts.
*   The speaker asserts that he is "literally telling you the future" using freely available concepts, not bending time and space.

## **Swing Trading Strategy: Entry, Stop Loss, and Target**

*   Two critical requirements for successful swing trading based on this approach:
    1.  **Entry Points:** Selecting a day to enter a swing trade (identified as "here, here, or here" on the chart).
    2.  **Stop Loss Placement:** Allowing for a stop loss *above* the identified high on the chart due to the nature of swing trading.
*   Objective: Capitalizing on a run *below* specified daily lows.
*   Verify data using:
    *   Settlement price on TradingView.
    *   (Preferred) Midnight opening price in New York local time.
*   Trading Action:
    *   Sell short if the price trades *below* the opening price.
    *   "Sell weakness" as it breaks away from the inefficiency and goes below the candle's low.
*   Clarification: Trading may not commence until a specific day if the opening price is too far from the fair value gap.

## **Adapting the Strategy to Different Lifestyles and Time Constraints**

*   Acknowledging that not everyone can engage in intraday trading due to life commitments.
*   Emphasizing that it's still possible to profit with a longer-term approach.
*   **Key Adjustments:**
    *   Higher degree of patience required.
    *   Lower leverage.
    *   Larger stop losses compared to intraday strategies.
*   **Core Principle:** The underlying logic of the model remains consistent regardless of the timeframe.
    *   If a fair value gap exists on a five-minute or 15-second chart, the stop loss still needs to be placed above the relevant high.
*   Addressing potential objections: If this approach doesn't suit you, explore other strategies.

## **Step-by-Step Guide for Non-Intraday Trading**

*   Determine the opening price (or midnight opening price) for the trading day.
*   Wait until after 9:00 PM the *next* day to account for the Asian session.
*   If the price trades *below* the opening price, initiate a short position.
*   Place a stop loss above the relevant high.
*   Utilize leverage that allows for this strategy without risking more than your comfort level (ideally, no more than 1%).
*   Acknowledging that the stop loss may seem "big," but it's necessary for capturing significant downward runs.
*   **Fundamental Point:** If you aspire to be a trader and can consistently identify accurate setups even on higher timeframes, you'll naturally adapt to lower timeframes.
    *   The lure of higher profits (e.g., $1000/day vs. $2000 over weeks) will drive these changes.
*   "Money talks, walks" – Results will influence life decisions and gain support from others.

## **Practical Application: Setting Up a Sales Stop Order**

*   Once a setup forms, sell short on weakness.
*   Employ a "sales stop" order – a stop loss that *enters* you into the trade, rather than stopping you out with a loss.
*   Place the sales stop at the opening price of the candle (preferably midnight New York time).
*   If the price remains *above* that level on the following day, the trade is not triggered (and you're not concerned).
*   Eventually, the price will likely trade *below* the level, triggering the short position.
*   Protect the short position with a stop loss above the relevant high.

## **Managing Multiple Positions and Partial Profits**

*   Multiple trades/positions are possible, even with limited capital.
*   Execute partial profit-taking at key levels.
*   Rationale: The anticipated run down creates a potential inefficiency, confirmed by a specific candle (September 5th).
    *   The high between the identified candles (high, high, low) indicates this inefficiency.
*   Adding back to Positions:
    *   After taking a partial profit, add back to the position when the price trades back into the inefficiency.
*   Reassurance: Even with heat ("ICT, it doesn't matter"), the core entry remains anchored, and the stop loss stays in place.

## **Swing Trading vs. Implied Trading and Profitability**

*   This logic is crucial for swing trading. If it doesn't resonate, swing trading may not be suitable.
*   Deviation from this approach can lead to frequent stop-outs, increased losses, impatience, and ultimately, a lack of profitability.
*   **Reality Check:** These combined factors can lead to discouragement and quitting.
*   The presenter emphasizes that he's not trying to sugarcoat anything.
*   After breaking below a certain point, more partials can be taken or additional positions can be entered.
*   Targets:
    *   Between a specific low and the next level down (the Weekly level).
*   Dividing the Range:
    *   When two targets are visible, divide the distance between them into quarters.

## **Debunking "Quarters Theory" and Clarifying Analysis**

*   **Strong Rejection:** Explicitly states that this approach has *absolutely nothing* to do with "quarters theory."
*   The speaker is projecting an "implied dealing range" – anticipating a break of the current low and a move towards a lower target.
*   Reminder to New Viewers: Review past content on the YouTube channel, which already predicted these downward movements.
*   Emphasizing that this isn't bragging, but a reminder to avoid taking things out of context.
*   Past Market Outlook:
    *   The speaker has not been bullish on Euro.
    *   The speaker has not been bullish on Cable (Pound Dollar).
    *   The speaker *has* been bullish on the dollar.
    *   The speaker has been bearish on indices after a specific high was reached.

## **Fibonacci Tool and Settings (For Those Who Ask)**

*   Addresses recurring questions about Fibonacci settings.
*   Provides a screenshot for viewers to capture the settings.
*   **TGIF (Thank God It's Friday) Measurements:**
    *   Changes specific settings (25 to 20 and 30) to measure 20% to 30% of the weekly range.
    *   These modified settings are *only* for TGIF retracement analysis.
    *   (A video explaining TGIF is available on the YouTube channel).
*   The remaining settings represent standard deviations.

## **Applying Fibonacci and Defining Implied Dealing Range**

*   Using the Fibonacci tool between a low and another low
*   If price breaks the low, it will start moving lower.
*   Defining the concept of **Implied Dealing Range**:
    *   The price hasn't reached a certain price yet.
    *   The speaker is "implying" that price *can* reach that target based on his analysis.
*   **Partial Profit-Taking Strategy:**
    *   If enough capital allows, take partial profits within the implied dealing range.
*   **Disclosure:**
    *   The speaker hasn't been actively trading Forex for years, focusing primarily on index futures.
*   **Reasoning:**
    *   Anticipating a "Black Swan event" and a potential decoupling/crash.
    *   Avoiding over-leveraging in anticipation of this event.

## **Equal Parts, Further Partial Profits and Long-Term Market Outlook**

*   Break down the distance between the low to the other low into four equal parts.
*   Wonderful area to take partials if the price reaches it.
*   Another partial if the price goes halfway between the two.
*   75% of profits should be booked.
*   Move of 400+ handles, and it is not micro moves
*   Can catch 250-300 handle runs, even if it requires acrobatics and wide stops
*   Changes may include:
*    - Stop working current job
*    - Change student schedule
*    -Make sacrifices

## **Evaluating Market Opportunities, Potential Change**

*   A Speculator in the markets has limitations in the beginning.
*   Results dictate the pace in which one makes changes.
*   If you are not successful, then stay where you are and pay the bills.
*   Overall, looking for lower prices and if a blow off move occurs at the 104.82 level.
*   If viewers are getting value from the information, like the stream, it is free.
*   Favors the pound over Euro because there is more distance before getting to the sell side.
*   If a dollar rally accelerates, cable is expected to have large down closed candles.
*   Cable is expected to reach a low.

## **Balanced Price Range**

*   There isn't any inefficiency apart from what we are trading at now.
*   Deep discount relative to the higher and the low down here.
*   From here to there is a balance price range because price has been offered up and down and then left it.
*   Almost touching the equilibrium and we are inside the fair value gap.
*   We could see it bounce from that area.
*   Because we traded into the inefficiency, there hasn't been any in there at all.
*   The only one is the price run from this low all the way up to there.
*   We could see a pause back into the inefficiency and wait to see what it does in this candle.


Okay, here's the organized and refined version of the provided text, adhering to all instructions:

# **Market Analysis: Weekly Highs, Bearish Outlook, and Trading Psychology**

## **Analyzing Weekly Highs and Potential Market Movements**

*   If price trades up into the weekly high, the speaker wants to see part of it stay open.
*   If price trades higher towards the end of the week or into the following week, the speaker wants a specific portion of the high to remain open.
*   **Caution:** The current week is still active, and the high could be taken out if it retraces before Friday's close.
    *   The high being highlighted (to make the low of this Gap) is subject to change.
    *   Continuous monitoring of price action is crucial.
*   The speaker wants to see at least half of the highlighted portion remain untouched.
*   If price trades up into that level on a closing basis on any daily chart, it should stay open like the speaker is showing.
*   **Overall Bearish Mindset:** The speaker anticipates a downward movement to a specific level.
    *   The longer-term outlook, established a month prior, remains bearish.
    *   The speaker expects higher prices for the dollar, indicative of a "risk-off" scenario.
    *   Risk-off implies that equities, stocks, gold, index futures, and Forex will generally move downwards.

## **Understanding Market Bias and Timeframes**

*   **Beginner's Imperative:** New traders must understand how to determine market bias and choose a direction with a high probability of success on higher timeframes.
*   **Disclaimer:** A macro bias doesn't guarantee profitability in every trade.
*   Adhering to a larger idea than your trading timeframe is crucial.
    *   This utilizes a time element rooted in a larger timeframe bias.
    *   Large institutions focus on weekly and daily charts due to liquidity pools and inefficiencies present on those timeframes.
*   **Focus:** The speaker emphasizes focusing on weekly and daily charts.
    *   Even if you're drawn to lower time frames.
*   The same principles apply to index futures and currency pairs.
*   **Core Price Action:**
    *   Price moves up for buy-side liquidity.
    *   Price moves up to trade into and reprice an inefficiency.
    *   Price drops down for sell-stop/sell-side liquidity.
    *   Price drops to reprice an inefficiency below.
*   Anything outside of these functions involves consolidation, sentiment building, and runs towards areas of high liquidity.
    *   It's advantageous for "smart money" to pair with the majority.
    *   The speaker suggests the market is, therefore, "rigged" and "premeditated".
*   **Manual Intervention:** Represents real underlying risk (e.g., a Black Swan event).
    *   This refers to an unexpected price reaction.
    *   For example, a news event that should cause the dollar to fall, but instead, it rises sharply.
    *   Explanations are provided *after* the fact, claiming the move was already priced in.
*   **Market Control:** The markets are absolutely controlled and rigged.
    *   Countries wouldn't put their financial stability in the hands of speculators.
*   Individuals like George Soros are presented as the "face" to divert attention.
    *   These figures are "marionette puppets" controlled by hidden forces.
*   The speaker is simply teaching where the strings are attached and where the puppet will place its next foot.

## **Daily Chart Analysis and Risk Management**

*   The speaker encourages viewing the daily chart with this insight in mind.
*   The speaker wishes he had this knowledge when starting out, available freely without upselling.
*   Prices have shown "stunning, beautiful delivery" on the daily chart.
    *   The speaker highlights the number of consecutive down days.
*   Given the inefficiency on the weekly chart, a retracement is reasonable.
*   **Identifying Potential Retracements:**
    *   The speaker addresses how to recognize when a trade might retrace against you (not necessarily reverse).
    *   The speaker addresses how to avoid sitting through a larger retracement.
*   **Partial Positions:** Entering partial positions allows for scaling out in case of being wrong.
*   **Funding Your Account:**
    *   Consistently fund your account and don't expect to capture the full move on every trade.
    *   It's unrealistic to anticipate capturing the entire move from entry to target every time.
*   **Progress, Not Failure:** Not achieving this every time is progress towards the goal, not failure.
*   The time it takes to reach that goal varies for everyone.
*   **Personal Challenges:** Each individual brings their own problems and character flaws to the journey.
    *   These must be addressed personally.
    *   The speaker asserts that no one can fix these inner problems for you.
*   **Timeframe for Mastery:** The speaker took roughly 3.5 years to figure it out, but 6 years to truly master it.
*   **Tenacity and Perseverance:** Are you willing to commit to an idea for multiple years without consistent comfort?
    *   This requires unshakable tenacity, distinct from a gambler's refusal to leave the table.
*   **Statistical Probabilities:** The speaker shares and teaches statistical probabilities with third-party audited settings.
*   You can learn this regardless of the time frame.
*   **Model Suitability:** Not every model fits perfectly for everyone.
    *   It's a "wrestling match" to determine how to apply the information.
*   The speaker has provided complete, step-by-step models for specific trading styles.
*   **Alternative to Fair Value Gaps:** Mitigation blocks can also be used.
    *   The speaker describes a specific candle pattern.
    *   This technique involves selling short within a specific candle range if price opens and trades above it, especially within the highest portion of the power three.

## **Mitigation Blocks, Confluence, and Trading Psychology**

*   **Mitigation Block Example:** Selling short inside a specific candle's range, particularly if the opening price trades above it, when looking for price to go lower.
*   **Risk Management:** Risk must be placed above the mean threshold of the candle.
*   **Mean Threshold Justification:** Mean threshold is just above an inefficiency.
*   **PD Array Confluence:** The speaker looks for confluence from three PD arrays.
    *   The previous mean threshold of the down-closed candle.
    *   The mean threshold of the bearish order block.
    *   The high of an inefficiency.
*   **Stop Loss Placement:** Stop losses are placed behind three PD arrays.
    *   If these fail, the speaker considers it a personal error.
*   **Error Acknowledgment:** Failure doesn't mean the system is flawed, but that the operator has made a mistake.
    *   It's time to exit the trade or let the stop loss do its job.
*   **Objective Decision:** The stop loss is an objective decision outside personal control.
*   **Stop Loss as Insurance:** Stop losses should be viewed as insurance against catastrophic loss.
*   Avoid viewing stop losses as scary or trying to avoid them at all costs by not using them.
    *   This leads to account blow-ups and unsustainable drawdowns.
*   **Drawdown Recovery:** Any drawdown can be recovered with time and commitment.
*   Avoid negative narratives about drawdown recovery.
    *   Each winning trade is an incremental step forward.
*   All learning experiences are valuable, especially in the beginning.
*   **Focus on Positivity:** Avoid negative self-talk and embrace realistic leverage.
*   **Apply the Teachings:** Apply the speaker's teachings and focus on how to think about price action.
*   **Growth Through Discomfort:** Growth involves pushing through discomfort.
*   **Journaling and Self-Encouragement:** Journaling helps track progress and encourage oneself through rough patches.
    *   Write down successes, analyze failures, and act as your own counselor and cheerleader.
*   This creates a personalized technical analysis book.
*   **Periods of Inactivity:** Even experienced traders have periods of inactivity, waiting for the market to clear.
*   After periods of uncertainty or consolidation, the speaker often returns to a high strike rate.

## **Aussie Dollar Analysis and Sell-Side Liquidity**

*   The speaker transitions to analyzing the Aussie dollar.
*   The speaker admits he expected a low to be taken out overnight while he was sleeping.
*   Be mindful that there's sell.


Okay, here's the organized and refined version of the provided text, adhering to all instructions:

# **Market Analysis: Gold, ES (S&P 500), and NASDAQ**

## **Aussie Dollar Recap and Sell-Side Liquidity**

*   The speaker expresses his expectation of the **Aussie dollar** taking out a low overnight.
*   He emphasizes the importance of being aware of **sell-side liquidity** below.
*   The speaker wants to see the Aussie dollar gravitate below that level throughout the day and into Friday.
*   He clarifies he's not suggesting that's the only target but feels it makes sense for it to reach that point.
*   The general outlook is **bullish dollar** and **bearish** for everything else.

## **Gold Market Analysis: Manipulation and Trading Considerations**

*   **Gold** is described as a highly manipulated market.
    *   While the speaker and his students trade it, he doesn't recommend trading it every day.
    *   This is presented as a personal opinion.
    *   If a trader's entire strategy revolves around gold, the speaker's opinion is irrelevant.
*   The speaker recalls mentioning previously that gold would eventually try to reach down into an **inefficiency**.
    *   The speaker suggests listeners review their notes or previous videos from late May to early June for commentary on this.
    *   He recalls discussing the potential for gold to trail down into a gap and take out sell-side liquidity.
    *   Gold came "real close" to this scenario.
*   If the dollar continues to strengthen, it will put pressure on the sentiment of gold being bullish.
*   **Diametrically Opposed Movement:** Higher dollar prices should lead to weaker gold prices.
    *   When they move in tandem (decoupling), it signifies a risky scenario.
    *   In such a scenario, traders should either scalp or avoid trading.
*   **Key Levels for Gold (Assuming Dollar Strength):**
    *   Relatively equal lows.
    *   Open inefficiency.
    *   Potential acceleration below those lows to trade down into an order block (starting at a specific candle's opening).
*   **Sentiment:** The speaker is not bullish on gold and doesn't want to trade it but is providing analysis due to viewer requests.
*   **Change in Outlook:**
    *   The speaker's bearish outlook on gold would change if gold closes *above* a specific order block.
    *   Specifically, if gold does not close above the September 22nd candle's high (approximately 1929.50) on a daily chart, he believes the previously mentioned levels are in play.
    *   A closing basis above this high is the "icebreaker" that would change the whole discussion.

## **Humor and Addressing the Audience**

*   The speaker jokingly responds to a hypothetical commenter urging him to continue speaking at length ("stay on all day ICT"). He states he's not there for that.
*   He notes the time (9:00 AM) and explains he needs to spend time with his son, incorporating "reading price action" into his homeschooling.

## **ES (S&P 500) Analysis: Weekly Chart and Quarterly Shift**

*   The speaker encourages viewers to give the video a "thumbs up" if they find it helpful.
*   **Recap of August Commentary:**
    *   The speaker recalls stating in August that the market (ES) would trade up into a specific high.
    *   He also mentioned a similar scenario for the NASDAQ.
    *   He then discussed the idea of a **quarterly shift**, meaning he expected a directional change over the next two to three months.
*   He addresses the perception that he "cherry picks" and deletes inaccurate predictions, stating that he never deletes anything.
*   **Quarterly Shift Outcome:**
    *   Price traded just inside an inefficiency, failing to take out the high.
    *   The speaker reiterates his expectation for a quarterly shift, anticipating movement into October and November.
    *   He emphasizes that his students should be applying his core content lessons to this analysis.
    *   He notes that his analysis was shared on YouTube via live streams and recorded sessions with timestamps.
*   **Current Market Position:**
    *   The market is trading inside an inefficiency.
    *   He references a range between a weekly low candle (43.52.50) and a candle from May 22nd, 2023.
    *   He has drawn the range down to the "body" of the candle.
*   **Volume Imbalance Explanation:**
    *   He explains that he accounted for the volume imbalance in the area.
    *   Without the volume imbalance, a "volume of balance" would be present, likely causing price to stop at "consequent encroachment" (midpoint).
*   He tests the theory by measuring from body to body.
    *   Price from body to body: 4307.25.
    *   Low: 4305.50.
*   He emphasizes the precision of his analysis on a higher timeframe (weekly chart).
*   **Future Expectations:**
    *   He doesn't believe the market will only go down to a certain point and then rise.
    *   He anticipates a deeper repricing.
    *   He doesn't think the low has been hit yet or that "capitulation" has occurred.
    *   He believes tougher times are ahead for the marketplace.
*   He reiterates that he incorporated the entire scope of the range due to the volume imbalance, which is why he drew it to a specific area.
*   He reminds viewers of his August commentary, where he predicted the market would go up and then a quarterly shift would occur, drawing the price down into the current area.
*   He notes that the price run was approximately 300 handles on the S&P.

## **ES (S&P 500) Analysis: Daily Chart**

*   The speaker reminds the viewers of the predictions he made beforehand to create an "emotional experience" by helping them remember the accuracy of his past statements. He clarifies this is not bragging, but to emphasize that the shared insights were real-time and verifiable.
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The market ran up and took out a high.
    *   It then broke lower and traded higher into an inefficiency/bearish order block.
*   **Breakaway Gap:**
    *   He emphasizes the importance of a breakaway gap as proof that the market wants to go lower.
    *   He asks if the gap filled in or repriced to.
    *   The fact that it *didn't* fill is a strong signature indicating a high likelihood of running the lows out.
*   **Price Action and Support/Resistance:**
    *   Price comes back up and trades into a low.
    *   The speaker critiques the traditional "support becomes resistance" theory.
    *   He challenges viewers to show him where they shorted at that level *before* the event occurred.
    *   He states the reason that low "worked" as resistance has nothing to do with the low itself but with something else entirely that the viewer needs to study.
    *   He states everything in the area gives you "this and that" which causes the price to run down and fall short of what is inbound on the weekly chart.

## **ES (S&P 500) Analysis: Weekly Chart - Inefficiency and Order Blocks**

*   Reminds that the speaker is still working off of a weekly chart range.
*   If doing the inefficiency on the daily chart, start in a specific area using the order block.
*   The chart shows a close below this, which indicates that the price could retrace back to an already delivered area, which is the down close candle.
*   The speaker points out a wick next to the down close candle, highlighting that halfway point of that wick is "consequent encroachment".
*   States that this level should be added to the viewer's chart.
*   He explains that he would like to see the level *not* be traded to because it becomes a PD array. If it *does* trade to this level, it would need to "smash" right through and not go any higher to maintain a bearish outlook.

## **ES (S&P 500) Analysis: Critical Levels and Bearish Outlook**

*   The speaker outlines key levels:
    *   Mean threshold of the down-closed candle (4343.75).
    *   Range of the inefficiency on the weekly chart.
    *   Mean threshold.
*   He notes that there is an "agreement" between two PD arrays that suggest trading up to these levels is reasonable.
*   He asks if the price can trade above this in a "mohawk" or "stab" and still remain bearish.
    *   The viewer would have to contend with 4351.75.
*   The speaker notes that trading up to that level is "perfectly acceptable," "permissible," and "reasonable."
*   He re-emphasizes that he would need to see a *daily close* above 4351.75 (the consequent encroachment) to change his outlook to no longer being bearish.
*   He adds that closing above this would mean the price is going through three PD arrays.
*   If the viewer had done this analysis, there is nothing wrong with it.
*   He explains how to incorporate a volume imbalance.
*   He reiterates his bearish stance and what would change his mind (daily close above mean threshold/consequent encroachment).

## **NASDAQ Analysis: Inefficiencies and Volume Imbalance**

*   The speaker states that he has finally made it to the NASDAQ chart.
*   He will apply the same principles to the NASDAQ that he mentioned previously.
*   If the viewer is using inefficiencies and mapping them on their charts and there is a volume imbalance that is a part of the candles, they *cannot* ignore this.
*   The volume imbalance *has* to be included.
*   The speaker provides an example of a fair value gap with an up-close candle (busy).
*   If the viewer wants to see the total scope of the inefficiency, this is how they need to do it.
*   The speaker explains that if one only looks at this area, they are not taking into account that it could also trade down into another area.
*   The speaker mentions that the price *has* traded down into the volume imbalance and consequent encroachment of the wick.


Okay, here's the organized and refined version of the provided text, adhering to all instructions:

# **NASDAQ Analysis: Bearish Outlook and Critical Levels**

## **NASDAQ: Tolerance for Retracement and Volume Imbalance**

*   The speaker states that it is "perfectly reasonable" for the NASDAQ to trade above a specific candle's high and into a certain portion.
*   However, he emphasizes that he **would not want to see it close above the volume imbalance**.
*   **Bearish Long-Term Outlook:**
    *   As long as the NASDAQ doesn't close above the volume imbalance, the speaker remains bearish long-term.
    *   A close above this level would "change the whole setting."
    *   He clarifies this doesn't mean he would go long, but he would abandon his bearishness.
*   **Target:** The speaker believes the NASDAQ will reach a specific target before Thanksgiving.
*   **Weekly Volume of Balance:** This serves as the "icebreaker"; a closing basis above it would invalidate the bearish outlook.
*   **Audience Engagement and Education:**
    *   The speaker expresses a desire for viewers to "thumbs up" the video if they find it helpful.
    *   He notes his discouragement when viewers consume the content for free without providing that simple currency.
    *   He is taking time away from his son to provide this free education.
    *   He suggests viewers create a YouTube channel to save liked videos for future reference.
    *   He emphasizes that his private students are learning the same content alongside the public audience.
    *   He explicitly states that he is not providing signals or private mentorship.
    *   The speaker is teaching for free to make it unprofitable for others to sell his material.

## **NASDAQ: PD Arrays and Consequent Encroachment**

*   **Present Week's High:** The speaker is willing to accept a trade above the present week's high as one PD array on the weekly chart, given his bearish framing.
*   **Identifying PD Arrays:**
    *   He identifies the consequent encroachment as another PD Array.
    *   This is determined by the low formed on the candle's high (or the present weekly high) and the candle's high from September 11th.
    *   Last week is being treated as a fair value gap in the form of a sell-side imbalance buy-side inefficiency (SIBI).
    *   Down-close fair value gaps are SIBIs; up-close candles with fair value gaps are BIs.
*   **Acceptable Retracement:**
    *   He accepts that the NASDAQ could trade above this week's high.
    *   He also accepts the possibility of it retracing to the consequent encroachment of the candle's inefficiency (15,156.25).
*   **Volume Imbalance (Critical Level):** The speaker highlights the importance of the volume imbalance as the key determinant.
*   **Three PD Arrays (The Limit):** If there is a closing price *above* the volume imbalance on the weekly chart, he will abandon his bearish outlook.
    *   He does not believe this will occur.
*   **Time Horizon and Price Target:**
    *   The speaker provides a time horizon (before Thanksgiving) and a price target.
    *   He also specifies the condition that would invalidate his bearish view.
*   **Analyst Perspective:**
    *   The speaker emphasizes that he is presenting the analysis from the perspective of an analyst.
    *   He is sharing the factors that inform his bearish outlook and what would cause him to change his mind.
    *   These are the questions that viewers are trying to answer themselves.
*   **Three Levels of Resistance:**
    *   He outlines that there must be three levels that would otherwise be acceptable retracement points.
    *   If all three fail to hold as resistance, the bearish scenario is invalidated.
    *   These levels should stop price from going higher; a close above the volume imbalance signals a shift.

## **NASDAQ: Smart Money and Gap Analysis**

*   **Smart Money Signals:** Smart money will interpret a close above the volume imbalance as a sign that the market is no longer moving lower.
    *   They may move sideways temporarily and wait for more information.
    *   An upside displacement would signal to smart money to wait for a reset (re-price lower).
    *   This isn't driven by buying/selling pressure, but a form of communication.
*   **Daily Chart Confirmation:**
    *   The speaker notes that the volume imbalance may not appear the same on the daily chart as it does on the weekly chart.
    *   If a volume imbalance is present on the daily chart, it is a significant confirmation.
*   **Breakaway Gap Significance:**
    *   A gap that isn't retraced to or repriced to serves as a significant mile marker in a price run.
    *   Similar to the S&P 500, the NASDAQ has a breakaway gap.
*   **Recent Price Action:**
    *   Price broke lower after not trading back into a prior gap.
    *   The market tapped into and engaged a pool of liquidity below a certain level on the higher time frame (weekly and daily).
*   **Future Expectations (Daily Chart):**
    *   The speaker believes the NASDAQ shouldn't even need to trade back above a specific level.
    *   On the daily chart, he will be more sensitive to not taking short positions if price moves above a certain level.
    *   Even with the weekly chart context, he doesn't believe the price structure on the daily chart allows for price to move that high.
*   **Critical Level (Daily Chart):**
    *   He would like to see the NASDAQ stay *below* the consequent encroachment of the candlestick's tail (wick) below its body.
    *   If the market trades to it or refuses to trade to it and breaks lower, it would signify a strong bearish signal.
*   **Reading Price and Tape:** This provides context for the magnitude of the potential move.

## **NASDAQ: Trading Edge and Bearish Conviction**

*   **Understanding Price Action:** Understanding the details of what *should* be allowed for in price helps provide an edge.
*   **Powerful Signal:** If the market shows no interest in returning to certain levels, it's a powerful signal for being on the correct side of trades.
*   **Internal Dialogue:** The speaker is sharing his internal thought process and how it has been codified in his algorithm.
*   **Price Target and Timeframe:** He reiterates his target of lower prices by Thanksgiving.
*   **Tolerance for Delay:** He clarifies that a delay of a week or so into December wouldn't be considered a failure of his analysis.
*   **Bearish Strategy:** He is bearish and will be looking for short positions.
*   **Account Verification:** The speaker addresses skepticism by stating that he is trading with a real money account.
*   **Call to Action:** The speaker is ending his analysis and will be watching a live streamer. He will share any insights gained or lessons taught to his son on Twitter later in the day.
*   **Closing Remarks:** He wishes the viewers a wonderful day and safe trading.

Here's a refactored and organized version of the provided text. All details, context, and nuances have been retained while improving clarity, grammar, and coherence.

# Market Analysis and Trading Insights

## Introduction

Video URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_iJlBKYmUc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_iJlBKYmUc)

This analysis covers the **Dollar Index**, **Euro Dollar**, and **Pound Dollar**, revisiting points from this morning's live stream. The emphasis is on understanding price delivery, identifying key levels, and managing expectations after significant market movements.

## Dollar Index Analysis

*   Mentioned in the morning live stream before the opening bell.
*   Specific high levels identified as a **draw** but expected with back and forth price action, not a straight run.
*   The live stream covered what would invalidate the bullish outlook for the Dollar Index and bearish outlook for other markets.

## Euro Dollar Analysis

### Key Levels and Liquidity

*   Market reached below a key level (unspecified).
*   Anticipated a draw on liquidity if the market became active below the initial low.
*   The initial low delivered "beautifully".

### Four-Hour Timeframe

*   Consolidation around the old low of May 31st, 2023.
*   Breakdown created a **sell-side imbalance buy-side inefficiency (SIBI)**.
    *   **SIBI Level**: 1.0609 (price action perfectly delivered to this level).
    *   Confirmation: The high of a specific candle precisely matched this price.
*   Observed a breakaway gap.

### Hourly Chart

*   Looking for a specific sell-side liquidity pull.
*   Watching for an immediate rebalance at the low of a large down-closed candle.
    *   Immediate rebalance is considered one of the strongest algorithmic signatures if you know the likely market direction.
    *   **Immediate Rebalance vs. Fair Value Gap**:
        *   **Immediate Rebalance**: Market returns to a level to signal quick movement in the anticipated direction (imbalance above or below).
        *   **Fair Value Gap**: A deferred repricing and rebalancing that can remain open for days, weeks, months, or even years.

### 15-Minute Timeframe

*   Notable drop.
*   Time: 7 AM New York time.
*   Sell-side imbalance buy-side inefficiency (SIBI) broken over two candles.
*   Trading into this level led to consolidation around the low and then a break through it.
*   Institutional refill entry drill occurred.
    *   Partial entry into the imbalance.
    *   Institutional Workflow Entry Drill: When price pokes just above a level.
    *   Consequent Encroachment: Halfway point of the imbalance.

### Midweek Considerations and Future Expectations

*   Because targets were reached, it's midweek, and markets have moved considerably over the last couple weeks in assets like Dollar Index, equities, Forex, bond market, gold, a retracement is reasonable.
*   No trading planned for the next day (presumably Wednesday), with limited action expected until Friday.
*   The focus is on not forcing trades.
*   Anticipate Consolidation and/or Retracements

### Addressing Common Questions about Deliverance

*   Common question: What to do next after a target is delivered?
*   The new/impatient trader immediately seeks the next opportunity.
*   Speculation that some individuals may be waiting for incorrect calls to criticize.
*   The issue is often a desire for a "dopamine hit" from correctly predicting the next move, especially after missing a previous opportunity.
*   The speaker used to condition his paid membership students to wait and realize that they just witnessed something that everyone claims cannot be done.

### The Importance of Patience and Perspective

*   Emphasis on relaxing after successful analysis and significant market movements.
*   Allowing the analysis to "stew" instead of immediately seeking the next trade.
*   Not feeling compelled to know the immediate next move.
*   While a retracement is anticipated, it doesn't necessarily indicate a market bottom.
*   No current reasons to justify buying equities.

## Pound Dollar Analysis

### Daily Chart and Weekly Imbalance

*   Screenshots of charts with annotations are encouraged.
*   Discussion on the live stream about the balanced price range.
*   Weekly imbalance marked out.
*   The speaker would like to see the remainder of that closed and become really efficiently delivered all through here.

### Weekly Chart Details

*   Back-and-forth movement within a range.
*   An inefficiency highlighted, affecting future price delivery.
*   A singular candle created the body between that inefficiency from March to September.
*   The price provided back and forth delivery and price action where it only went up on the time frame.
*   Efficiently delivered price is where the market will offer on the downside.
*   Concept of *redelivery*, not rebalancing yet.

### Daily Chart

*   Inefficiency used as resistance before breaking lower.
*   Belief that another weekly imbalance also broke lower.
*   Reached the low of the weekly imbalance.
*   At the midpoint/equilibrium of the shaded area.
*   Will require significant force to break through the lower end.
*   Year-end Target: Expectation of Pound Dollar below the current level by year-end.
*   The live stream explained why I would be wrong with my assessment if certain factors for each market occurred.
*   Holding to the bias that the dollar is bullish long term, causing all asset classes to be weaker as a result.
*   Basically, Risk off is still in play, where everything goes down while dollar goes up.

### Four-Hour Chart

*   Nice delivery into the weekly buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency (SIBI)/fair value gap (from the weekly chart).

### Hourly Chart

*   Consistent break lower.
*   Risk of getting excited by small swing lows without understanding higher timeframes (weekly, monthly, daily).
*   This is a **sell program**: treat up-close candles as resistance.
*   Bearish order flow persists until up-close candles are broken by price movement above them.
*   No need for retail tools like trend lines or moving averages.

### Target and Expectations

*   Reached the lower end of the inefficiency, stopping for the day.
*   The lower end of the inefficiency was 1.2114, and the low was less than a pip away.
*   Anticipating consolidation/retracement after reaching deep discount objectives.

### Consolidation vs. Reversal

*   Lack of clarity in books regarding anticipating consolidation vs. a trend reversal.
*   The speaker aims to create a language for understanding market timing.
*   Creating a rule-based approach to build unique trading models.

### Core Concepts and Model Building

*   Use available core concepts on the YouTube channel as building blocks.
*   Focus on a pre-packaged view: price action at a specific time of day.
*   Low probability actions, not obvious in one side going higher or lower, should be avoided or only risked a very small amount of money.

### Progress and Self-Assessment

*   Consistency over time provides a baseline understanding.
*   Develop an affinity for a specific PD array or model.
*   Potentially outgrow the current approach and find a unique one.
*   Need a "measuring stick" to track progress.
*   Differentiate between improvement and a bad day.
*   Consistent mistakes without learning are not progress.
*   Logging experiences, even failures, provides valuable data for personal KPIs (Key Performance Indicators).
*   Each individual's statistics (including mine and my son's) are unique.

### My Son's Trading Experience

*   His son experienced 12 straight winning days with TOP Step.
*   He lost on lunch at work trading on the phone in a panic, ending his perfect track record.


Here's a refactored and organized version of the provided text. All details, context, and nuances have been retained while improving clarity, grammar, and coherence.

# Trading Psychology, Market Analysis, and Model Building

## Son's Trading Experience and Lessons

*   The speaker emphasizes the importance of learning from both winning and losing experiences.
*   His son initially had **12 straight winning days** with TOP Step.
*   The winning streak ended when his son "fought it" and took a loss while trading on his phone during lunch, demonstrating the impact of emotional decisions.
*   He exceeded the contract limit (**five contracts**) leading to maximum loss, but the account wasn't blown.
*   The trading platform stopped him from further losses, which the speaker views as positive.
*   His son requested another payout, totaling **$1500+** earned in less than a month, with **two payouts** in that time.
*   The speaker notes that his son's success is unique, as most traders fail combines and never achieve a payout.
*   The speaker acknowledges that observers on Twitter likely had varied reactions, ranging from excitement to disbelief.
*   He emphasizes that a **100% win rate is unsustainable**, and losses are inevitable.

### The Value of Journaling

*   Journaling helps identify both correct and incorrect decisions.
*   The speaker advises against abandoning a trading model or approach simply due to deviations or "tilt."
*   **Tilt** is defined as breaking rules, over-trading, using too many contracts, or trading excessively.
*   A rule-based approach and plan can mitigate these issues.

## Avoiding Impulsive Trades in Oversold Conditions

*   The speaker emphasizes the importance of avoiding impulsive short trades when the market reaches a long-term discount array, regardless of market movement
*   Whether trading Forex, futures, bonds, or crypto, avoid impulsive short positions after reaching a long-term bearish discount array.
*   Even if the market continues to drop significantly, resist the urge to chase the move.
*   Preparing for times when you *don't* trade is crucial.
*   The market is likely to correct upwards to some degree.
*   Potential scenarios include:
    *   A small shift in market structure on lower timeframes before resuming the downtrend.
    *   A larger correction to higher levels.
    *   Sideways movement within a defined range.

### Importance of Taking Profits

*   If you've profited, secure some gains. This doesn't necessitate closing the entire position.
*   The market is "oversold" due to significant downward movement and reaching a targeted level.
*   On the 15-minute timeframe, the market has delivered to the low end of an inefficiency.

## E-Mini S&P Weekly Chart Analysis

*   Appreciation is expressed for thumbs-up ratings on the live stream, as they provide feedback on the commentary.
*   The speaker highlights the **inefficiency and volume imbalance**, referencing previous analysis, and emphasizes that the market has moved outside those boundaries.
*   The price action within a specific range is considered efficient due to the back-and-forth movement.
*   However, the market has now left that range and created an imbalance.
*   Returning to this price level will require significant effort due to the previously balanced price action.
*   The speaker contrasts this with an inefficiency and volume imbalance, which makes it easier for the price to move through.
*   He mentions his appearance on Top Step's live stream, where he identified the **610 level on NASDAQ** as a target.

### Sister Theory

*   The "sister theory" is introduced, explaining the correlated movement of closely related markets.
*   These markets usually move in tandem, though not always perfectly synchronized.
*   Breaks in correlation can offer valuable trading insights.
*   If one index makes a fast move, the correlated market might still offer an opportunity to reach its objectives.
*   Earlier in the year, NASDAQ was the outperformer to the upside.
*   Recently, the S&P has shown weakness and led the decline, reaching its discount arrays more quickly.
*   Key areas of focus include the inefficiency between specific candle lows and highs.
*   Whenever a volume imbalance is present with an inefficiency, it should be highlighted.

### Market Context and Strategy

*   The speaker acknowledges that some viewers may be hearing this analysis for the first time.
*   The market has delivered beyond the levels initially anticipated.
*   The indices have experienced a sustained downward trend over the past four weeks.
*   However, the speaker doesn't view this as capitulation or a market bottom, suggesting further downside potential.
*   He advises caution when taking new short positions in deeply discounted areas.
*   Avoid heavy short positions and maximum leverage.
*   Be wary of "wicked intraday reversals" designed to acquire new short positions before another move lower.

## Daily Chart and Sentiment Analysis

*   The speaker suggests that the daily chart may show candles with wicks and tails on both sides, indicating volatility within the current range.
*   This is because the market is deeply discounted, and many traders are now looking to short.
*   The speaker wants his students to analyze the market from a sentiment standpoint, recognizing that "street money" relies on patterns and confirmation.
*   Retail traders need chart confirmation before trusting a bullish or bearish bias, lacking an understanding of where the market is likely to be drawn (liquidity or inefficiencies).

### Identifying Premium and Discount Levels

*   The speaker identifies a premium inefficiency and a premium buy-side level.
*   He also highlights a discount inefficiency, noting that it hasn't been fully repriced.
*   If the market moves lower out of the current range, it's reasonable to expect a move down to the lower inefficiency.
*   The key is to watch price action at specific times of the day.
*   The speaker emphasizes the importance of identifying higher timeframe levels that act as draws on liquidity.
*   The speaker identifies key premium and discount levels for potential future price movements.
*   A continuation of the bearish trend would likely target the premium levels.
*   The speaker notes a sell-side liquidity area as a possible, though less likely, target.

### Trading Strategy and Patience

*   The speaker emphasizes the importance of avoiding intraday trades based on short-term charts (1-minute, 5-minute, 15-minute) if the longer-term analysis suggests a different direction.
*   If your model suggests a longer-term move, consider leaving a small portion of the position open (e.g., one micro contract).
*   Participating in these protracted price runs builds confidence and teaches patience.
*   It reduces the urge to take profits prematurely due to fear.
*   If this feeling persists, reduce position size to a manageable level.

# Trading Psychology, Market Analysis, and Strategy Refinement

## The Importance of Patience and Gradual Growth

*   If you're aiming for a specific profit target, like "bucks or whatever," set your trade and "just leave it alone."
*   If watching the trade makes you nervous, walk away.
*   Ensure your stop-loss is set and your limit order is placed at a higher timeframe level, "plus a couple handles or maybe five Pips if you're trading Forex."
*   The key is to let the trade unfold.
*   By doing this, you've already secured part of the move.
*   If you don't follow this approach, "you will never develop the courage and patience to wait for these trades to pan out."
*   The speaker criticizes traders who "completely undermine themselves by complaining publicly in tweets and videos and live streams" about the difficulty of holding trades.
*   The solution is to "listen to the things I'm suggesting to you because it's easy to do if you continually desensitize yourself to it."
*   Holding for longer-term targets is initially challenging.
*   You must gradually embrace the discomfort.
*   Realize that "this isn't as bad as I thought it was."
*   Consider this scenario: You're up 50 handles in the indices or 50 pips in Forex.
*   Your analysis suggests the market can move another 100 points/handles/pips.
*   Take off the majority of your position.
*   Leave one remaining contract or lot.
*   Move the stop-loss on that remaining position to a profitable level.
*   The speaker expresses frustration with traders who repeatedly fail to hold onto winning trades, despite his advice given in tweets and Twitter spaces.
*   He notes that the pressure of being watched and judged impacts traders' comfort levels.
*   The desire for a quick win becomes overwhelming.
*   This feeling mirrors the pressure traders face even in the privacy of their own trading.
*   The urge to exit and secure the win is strong.
*   For those who haven't experienced a winning trade, it might seem easy to hold.
*   However, "no you wouldn't, no you wouldn't."
*   The first stage of growth is breaking even.
*   Then, focus on small, consistent wins ("base hits").
*   After building that foundation, gradually increase your targets.
*   If you're consistently achieving 10 handles, aim for 15.
*   If you're consistently achieving 15 handles, aim for 20.
*   Avoid extreme over leveraging, such as "reaching for five contracts," as the speaker's son did.
*   His son also attempted to target 40 handles, which he wasn't ready for.
*   He then tried to correct his mistakes after experiencing initial success.
*   The speaker referenced a tweet from two days prior, where he warned that an "inevitable loss is going to come" after his son's 12-day winning streak, causing an unraveling.
*   To avoid these pitfalls, focus on the advice given.
*   The speaker promises that his suggestions will help manage the fear of missing out, fear of being stopped out, and fear of losing trades.
*   The speaker is frustrated by traders who "constantly complain about how they can't hold on to these big wins when they can."
*   Even with multiple contracts, you can leave one running.
*   It doesn't matter "who cares if it runs 50 more handles on it and then turns around and eventually stops out."
*   This provides valuable experience in holding trades.
*   You could have moved your stop loss and secured a larger profitable exit.
*   How will you grow if you don't "press into these uncomfortable positions where it's displeasing to you"?
*   You must find a way to be comfortable in your own skin while trading.
*   Avoid placing excessive stress on your results by using maximum leverage and expecting Olympic-level performance.
*   This is what professional money managers avoid.
*   You're making success "so likely to be impossible," but you may not realize it.
*   You're pursuing "astronomical returns" that are unrealistic.
*   The speaker believes it's impossible but acknowledges that traders convince themselves to aim for it every time.
*   The speaker's son attempted this approach and hit the "maximum loss," requiring him to recuperate the following day.
*   The speaker believes his son can recover, but only if he "listen[s] to the rules."
*   He notes that his son followed the rules for 12 days, which is progress.
*   The new goal is for his son to follow the rules for 13 days, surpassing his previous record.
*   The speaker will encourage him to exceed that mark and enter new learning territory.
*   If you're trading without journaling, you can't measure real progress.
*   You'll be "spinning your wheels."
*   You may have past profits and payouts from funded accounts.
*   However, you need a "real graduated increase in your understanding and your ability to do what it is you're doing."
*   He trails off mentioning computers.
*   The speaker acknowledges his tendency to go on "three decade rabbit Trails" during live streams, but assures that it's valuable content.
*   He contends that anyone who doesn't recognize the value in this knowledge is "a fool" and likely still working a job.
*   To transition away from employment and become a successful speculator, these are necessary steps.
*   The only way to learn and progress is to "press in press into that discomfort" and expand your comfort zone.
*   This process takes time; it's not an overnight transformation.
*   You won't become the "Babe Ruth of trading" overnight, predicting market movements with ease.
*   There's a steep learning curve.
*   The current markets are particularly challenging, "the most difficult that I've ever seen."
*   Even experienced traders may not find these markets easy.
*   Constant geopolitical and economic uncertainties create fear among investors.
*   The market churns as a result.
*   It should be "confident building" to see the speaker's teachings hold true even in these climates.
*   Limiting yourself to "a handful of Trades per week," focusing on the "very best of the best setups from a four hour an hourly chart," can significantly improve your trading.
*   These setups should lead to an objective rooted in a weekly or daily chart.
*   New traders often equate progress with daily profits and constant risk-taking.
*   This conditions you to be a gambler, "never being comfortable in your skin," and pursuing unsustainable results.
*   "Nobody can sustain 100 percent."
*   The speaker is trying to mentor his son to surpass his own abilities.
*   His son will only reach that point by embracing uncomfortable challenges.
*   He wants to avoid the discomfort and seek shortcuts.
*   He wants immediate 50-100 handle moves.
*   The speaker tells his son, "You don't have it yet, but you're working towards it."
*   He will host a Twitter space this weekend to continue the discussion.
*   Avoid taking large risks on new short positions in deeply discounted areas.
*   The market is likely to retrace and seek liquidity.
*   "Smart money will selling buy stocks being rated that's being trailed."
*   In these Deep Discount moves, consider the location of short-term stops.
*   The speaker identifies buy stops and notes that is exactly what he called out in Patrick Wheelan's Life game this morning.

## Detailed Market Analysis and Specific Setups

*   Following a long period of work, the market moved lower outside of an inefficiency range.
*   On the 15-minute timeframe, previously broken up-close candles should act as resistance.
*   "Don't lose sight where are we at in this shaded area we're at the low end of that inefficiency."
*   Therefore, the likelihood of the market trading up to act as resistance is low.
*   The market entered a gap and traded outside the shaded area.
*   A swing high was broken, creating a breaker pattern.
*   The speaker believes the market is "asking to come back up in that area."
*   Mark this level on your 15-minute chart.
*   This is where traders with "real money in the marketplace" have trailed their stop losses.
*   If the market moves higher, it will target these buy stops.
*   These aren't retail stop losses but those of sophisticated traders.
*   If there are no inefficiencies above the market, it will target buy stops.
*   Buy stops reside above single highs or relative equal highs.
*   The speaker is interested in the market's behavior at these levels.
*   If these highs remain unbroken overnight, he anticipates a run into them tomorrow morning.
*   He'd look for a setup that either facilitates the run-up or allows him to short after a break and shift in market structure, targeting the low that formed prior to the relative equal high being swept.
*   He poses, "is that complicated?" and answers that "it's not, it's really simple stuff."
*   The logic behind his concepts is to provide detailed explanations, as that is what he requires.
*   He acknowledges that others may prefer to simply identify setups.
*   You don't need to know everything he knows or everything on his YouTube channel.
*   You only need to understand "where's the likely draw on liquidity on the higher time frame."
*   Determine the weekly chart's target (higher or lower level).
*   Identify whether that level is an inefficiency or buy/sell stops.
*   Focus on that target throughout the week.
*   Utilize specific sessions and market structure that support that idea.
*   Choose your setups wisely.
*   He provided a "silver bullet model" between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM New York local time.
*   This model makes it "so easy."
*   It eliminates the confusion of "when is this stuff form I don't know I see these got a million videos what are we supposed to do all this stuff I don't know it's too complicated."
*   "Let's go get me a moving average crossover into the casters that's a cop-out."
*   He emphasizes that he has "literally made it really easy for you."
*   There's a silver bullet at 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM and 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM New York local time.
*   There's also one at 3:00 AM to 4:00 AM London session.
*   Optionally, there's one at 7:00 AM to 8:30 AM.
*   These are "tucking them in there real deep real deep in the videos the guys don't want to stick around or they never get that stuff do they."

## NASDAQ Weekly Chart and Sister Theory

*   The speaker transitions to the NASDAQ weekly chart.
*   His son had deleted the annotations and he apologizes for the inconvenience.
*   He refers to an inefficiency and relative equal lows, anticipating a drawdown.
*   He states, "I don't believe we're done with NASDAQ even though we've seen the s p dig down into its respective inefficiency and then go below it."
*   This leads into the "sister Theory."
*   Since the S&P has already moved into and below its inefficiency, the NASDAQ may follow.
*   He introduces "SMT Divergence," explaining it as "a smart money technique or smart money tool."
*   The 'T' is undefined, but it represents "my way of reading cracks and correlation."
*   An example is the relationship between the S&P and...


Here's a restructured and detailed version of the provided text, designed for optimal readability and comprehensive information retention.

# Market Analysis: NASDAQ, S&P, and Gold; Plus Trading Psychology

## NASDAQ and S&P Analysis: Sister Theory and SMT Divergence

*   The speaker begins by analyzing the **NASDAQ** and comparing it to the **S&P**.
*   The **S&P** has "already traded down to its respective inefficiency," while the **NASDAQ** "just entered it today."
*   The speaker states he doesn't see the **NASDAQ's** action as an **SMT Divergence** that's bullish.
*   He acknowledges that some viewers are "wrestling with" the difference between a "**sick sister**" and **SMT**, and how to avoid being fooled.
*   He emphasizes that "**experience**" dictates understanding these nuances, and that overnight success is not the goal.
*   He answers questions from his comment sections and tweets when it "makes sense talking about it over the charts."
*   He clarifies that if the **NASDAQ** didn't go lower like the **S&P**, normally he'd be interested in going long, *if* his bias were bullish.
*   However, his bias is bearish.
*   He believes this is a temporary inability for the **NASDAQ** to deliver on the same context that the **S&P** submitted to earlier.
*   In other words, lower prices are still expected; the **NASDAQ** will just reach its targets later than the **S&P**.
*   He clarifies that an **SMT bullish Divergence** would be:
    *   **S&P** making a lower low while **NASDAQ** makes a higher low.
    *   Or, conversely, **NASDAQ** making a lower low and **S&P** making a higher low.
*   These divergences should occur between relative equal or unequal (but relative) highs and lows.
*   He emphasizes that if the **S&P** makes a higher high, the **NASDAQ** should also make a higher high.
*   And if the **NASDAQ** makes a lower low, the **S&P** should make a lower low.
*   He uses **SMT** as a confirmation for something he already expects in price on an interim, short-term, intraday basis.
*   While he doesn't *need* **SMT**, he likes it to be present in certain trades as an additional confluence.
*   He's not using **SMT** to try to call the bottom in the **S&P** or the **NASDAQ** because he believes there are still weeks of lower prices ahead.
*   He sees nothing bullish about equities right now.
*   He believes more people will be interested in selling short, which is why these market movements are allowed to occur in the fall.
*   He states "it's engineered" and refutes the idea that selling pressure is due to people getting out of their longs and selling.
*   He argues that the market is simply repricing lower because "they want you to sell."
*   He emphasizes the Market's decline is *not* a result of collective retail selling.
*   The market is engineered to encourage selling so that large funds can accumulate at lower prices, buying them up at a discount.
*   He dismisses arguments from books or other sources, stating "that's nonsense, that's fiction."
*   He firmly believes "these markets are rigged, they're controlled."
*   He submits the idea that seasonal influences exist in the marketplace.
*   Technically, nothing suggests a low has been made.
*   He believes the **NASDAQ** will eventually "dig into the deeper end of this shaded area" and trade into the volume imbalance between a specific candle's opening and closing prices.
*   If the market is "over zealous", it may move lower, to the area he then indicates.
*   He transitions to a daily chart.
*   Addressing viewers who prefer short videos, he jokes that he's already been talking for an hour.
*   He points out relative equal lows on the daily chart.
*   After removing a marking for clarity, he notes that the market traded lower, hitting a level today and an inefficiency below it.
*   He believes the market will "dig into that" level.
*   He identifies the midpoint of a candle's tail (wick) as a "consequent encouragement."
*   He states he doesn't want to see the price go above two specific candles, though it ultimately could.
*   He refers to specific things he mentioned in a morning livestream that would cause him to no longer be bearish on **NASDAQ**.
*   He identifies 148.80 (the opening price of a specific candle) as a key level.

## Four-Hour and Hourly Chart Analysis

*   He transitions to a four-hour chart, highlighting the delivery of price at the relative equal lows on the daily chart.
*   He notes the bodies of the candles are "just perfect."
*   Similar to his earlier comments about the **S&P**, he believes it's reasonable to see a reversion back to some measure of buy-side liquidity.
*   He says some highs look "a little too clean" and if the market goes there, it might go above it to a small inefficiency.
*   He suggests marking this area on charts overnight going into tomorrow morning.
*   If the market makes a lower low tomorrow (Thursday), be careful, as a sharper retracement could occur.
*   He explains that Thursdays, after many downside objectives have been met, can often create the low of the week.
*   If a lower low is made than today's low, "don't fight that" retracement, as it could go back up even higher and still be okay for the longer term bearish outlook.
*   He reminds listeners that lower objectives still exist and that "smart money is greedy."
*   He believes there are real orders higher up, and if the market rallies into those areas, people will think it's a low and buy, allowing smart money to sell into that rally.
*   He then says this may continue for "the coming weeks going into November maybe to see the lows that I think are later in the calendar year."
*   Transitioning to an hourly (60-minute) chart, he points out a small inefficiency.
*   He notes that price went up into this area this morning, specifically touching the bottom end of it.
*   He describes this touch as "almost giving me rebalance right there."
*   He identifies this rebalance as one of the strongest signals in price action.
*   If the market can rebalance immediately after creating a big up or down candle (regardless of timeframe), and your bias is bearish, that means "it's time to get in right now."
*   Stop losses can be very short and tight, with an immediate, snappy response delivering price towards the intended target.
*   This is a "real fun thing to practice" with one-minute, 30-second, and 15-second charts, as these patterns repeat often.
*   He emphasizes it's not about the number of handles or pips, but about practicing *when* it happens.
*   Train your eye to see if the market moves immediately after rebalancing, as expected.
*   This process completely desensitizes you from the fear of selling short when the market is going up.
*   He explains that when trading a fair value gap, you are doing exactly that – selling short into an up move.
*   He notes that his son used to be afraid to do this.
*   He told his son that morning where he thought the market was going to go to that day, and he says this is just like what he does on Twitter.
*   He says that is not him trading his son's account, but him telling his son where to focus.
*   Then, when there is a fair value gap that lines up after a stop hunt, go in and do what you're looking for.
*   He says this isn't complicated, but it requires patience to wait for these setups and the "balls basically to go short as the Market's going up."
*   Entering based on fair value gaps, institutional workflow entries, or fading old highs/lows requires trusting your directional bias.
*   This means if you're bearish, you're looking to enter when price is going up into inefficient areas or taking out buy stops.
*   He advises practicing this intraday through "tape reading".
*   He defines tape reading as simply watching price action in real-time without even pushing a button (not demo, combine, funded, or live accounts).
*   Observe whether the market trades into an area where you would be pressing a button, and then see what happens.
*   This desensitizes you to these setups by watching them in real-time.
*   Tape reading "ain't about looking at level two data that can be spoofed."
*   It's not about the DOM, ladders, or any of that.
*   It's simply looking at how price delivers at a specific time of day for either inefficiencies or liquidity pools above or below the marketplace.
*   "That's it. That's all prices doing. That's it. That's all it ever does. No patterns. No nothing. It's just that."
*   He refers back to the 15-minute timeframe.
*   He points out an area of back-and-forth price action, noting that it eventually "got real heavy here" and broke lower, clearing a level they had been looking for.
*   He asks if the subsequent reaction is random.
*   He emphasizes that they had been talking about this level for a month and a half as a draw on liquidity.
*   He states that many traders banked at that level and just below it.
*   He states that the rally is not a result of shorts covering.
*   He refutes the common explanation of "a short covering rally" or "a squeeze because shorts are covering."
*   He notes that he used to talk like that in his 20s because that's what everyone on social media and forums said.
*   He warns against hanging around that "herd mentality," as it will prevent you from seeing how the market really books price, which he states is "absolutely 100 rigged."
*   He emphatically declares that "it's rigged, it's an algorithm, it runs like a video game that's coded."
*   He insists that the highs and lows are already predetermined.
*   He highlights his ability to consistently call these market movements publicly and with precision.
*   He asserts that nobody could be this lucky unless the market was rigged.
*   He explains that he understands what's going on behind the candles: "the time of day, the day of the week, that week of the month, that month of the year, that season of the year, and how all these things relate to one another."
*   He waits for "Choice opportunities" where everything is one-sided, where he can see what the market is likely to reach for.
*   "That's when I tweet, that's when I go into other people's live streams and I tell them what's going to happen and it happens."
*   He clarifies that this is not bragging but rather a testament to what people have learned from him and are now doing on their own, making "real money, lots of money."
*   He acknowledges that he also has students who are losing money and working hard to improve.
*   He reiterates that success takes a lot of effort and time.

## Liquidity and Market Manipulation

*   He drops down to a five-minute chart.
*   He points out a nice device this morning that went all the way back up into that inefficiency.
*   He identifies the target as the liquidity below.
*   He emphasizes that it's not support and resistance.
*   He contrasts his approach with traditional support and resistance thinking, which would say "it got down here, buy it."
*   He teaches his students to drive *through* a level "like a bulldozer" because it's the liquidity *beyond* the level that's important.
*   "Knowing why a level should be traded to and through it is the beginning of understanding why the Market's going to have these ups and downs each day each session every 15 minutes."
*   He reiterates that the market is "running for liquidity," which is "the lifeblood of these Marketplace."
*   He urges listeners to realize this, as more opportunities will be laid in their lap.
*   He contrasts this with looking for patterns for the sake of patterns or relying on indicators like moving averages or MACD to tell you to get into a trend.
*   He states that placing your faith in these things is like placing your faith in religion.
*   He argues that everything you need to know is in the "simple little open high low enclosed candlesticks."

## Gold Analysis and Market Commentary

*   He transitions to gold.
*   He prefaces this by saying "don't get used to this because I don't like gold."
*   He goes to a daily chart.
*   He mentions he wanted to see gold trade down into the lower portion of an inefficiency this morning, specifically the sell-side liquidity below a certain level.
*   He notes they "just about got there almost" and jokes that he "failed there" because he didn't get it right.
*   He follows by sarcastically saying that people will focus on the thing he didn't get right, and ignore everything else.
*   He states that the gold market is "very fickle" and "an event driven Market."
*   He believes this market should be traded less frequently by retail traders because it's "highly manipulated."
*   He compares it to the Swiss franc and the Japanese Yen, markets he also dislikes.
*   He says he's been burned by these markets, as they are "highly manipulated by their their central banks."
*   He believes gold is also manipulated.
*   He asserts that gold "should not even be below twenty five thousand dollars" because it "should be so expensive right now."
*   He claims "there's none of it you can't get your hands on it."
*   He says that every central bank has been hoarding gold for the last 2.5-3 years.
*   They are using it to back all the future currencies that they're going to replace everything in existence right now, including Bitcoin and crypto.

## Closing Remarks

*   He concludes the stream.
*   He wishes everyone a pleasant evening, mentioning he had fun doing the live streams.
*   He doesn't promise to be back on Friday, but guarantees he'll be on Twitter prior to Friday morning.
*   He encourages viewers to enjoy their Thursday, be careful, be safe, and study.
*   He advises not risking too much or forcing setups.
*   He finishes with "talk to you next time, be safe."

### **Introduction**
Good morning! As usual, let's start by checking Twitter. If you could provide a **5x5**, confirming that everything is clear on the chart and the audio and volume are good, I'd appreciate it. Also, please provide feedback on the latency, so I can get a feel for how long it takes for the information to reach you. Let's get this circus started!

### **Review of Previous Live Streams (Wednesday)**
I did two live streams on Wednesday. In the morning session, I reviewed what I felt would be impactful, and it came to pass. Then, in the afternoon, I reviewed what took place and what I thought was likely for Thursday's trading, and everything went according to plan.

*   Without stealing the thunder from those streams, I recommend checking them out on my **2023 ICT Mentorship playlist** on my YouTube channel.
*   Today, we'll briefly go through things, reminding you about two economic drivers coming out:

    *   **8:30 AM:** Core PCE Price Index (in about 19 and a half minutes).
    *   **10:00 AM:** Revised Consumer Sentiment number.
*   Expect some volatility around the **10:00** hour, potentially leading to a good **Silver Bullet** setup between **10:00 and 11:00**.

I won't be trading again today because I have plans for the weekend that require shopping and preparation.

### **Dollar Index (DXY) Analysis**

*   **Daily Chart:** As mentioned on Wednesday, we were likely to see the Dollar Index trade back into its created range. Wednesday's trading retraced, and today's trading continues.
*   **Key Observation:** Pay attention to the delivery and price action throughout.
*   **Inefficiency:** Watch the area closely today, especially around the **8:30 AM** and **10:00 AM** news events. This inefficiency is the only one on the daily chart. We're right at it now.
*   **Retracement:** We did see the retracement, and we got below an old high (a target from months ago). I'm not convinced we've ignored or abandoned trading back into that range. Check out the Wednesday live streams for more details.
*   **PD Arrays:** There's a volume imbalance inside a fair value gap. Study that, as that's where we basically traded to. It couples with the last up-closed candle, forming a bearish order block with a fair value gap and a volume imbalance (three PD arrays).
*   **Price Action:** The dollar opened, traded up, made the high of the session, and then came back down into a discount range.
*   **Seasonal Allergies:** Apologies in advance, as my voice might get hoarse due to allergies.
*   **Discount Range Objective:** We have a wick and a discount range objective on the downside. We'll be looking at the range here to here, with the consequent encouragement tagged.
*   **Below Consequent Encouragement:** Anything closing below this on the daily chart suggests we might go deeper than I'd like, potentially into this area.
*   **Trading Advice:** I don't suggest trading today. Be content with the profits you've made this week. Don't offer them up to the market and risk going into the weekend regretting it.

### **Euro (EUR/USD) Analysis**

*   **Feedback:** I'm getting feedback to analyze Forex again. I'll talk about it when it's salient.
*   **Wednesday's Prediction:** We were looking for it to trade below these lows, which it did on Wednesday. I said it was prime time for consolidation or retracement.
*   **Price Action:** We've done a lot on the downside, trading into sell-side liquidity.
*   **Thursday's Tendency:** Thursday can tend to make the opposite end of the weekly range, especially after meeting long-term or intermediate-term targets (significant drops).
*   **Sell-Side Liquidity:** The sell-side liquidity below has been engaged but not purged. I still think this low will eventually be traded to.
*   **Dollar Bias:** I'm still bullish on the dollar; I don't believe we've reversed or that it's topped out. I'm open to being proven wrong, especially on higher time frames.
*   **Higher Timeframe Reversals:** On higher time frame reversals (daily charts), I allow the market to give me a lot of information before changing my conviction. I try to avoid picking bottoms in bear markets or tops in bull markets.
*   **Wednesday's Retracement:** We talked about the likelihood of a retracement on Wednesday, and we saw that on Thursday, with follow-through today.
*   **Inefficiency:** If you look real close, there's a small inefficiency rate in there.
*   **Key Levels for Today:** I want to zoom in and take your attention to the levels that I think are salient for today. The wicks are lower than the candlesticks' bodies, and you want to have this noted here on your euro dollar at **1.0638** (three pipets). I won't leave it on my chart, but it could jump up in there with the news.
*   **Potential Draw:** If it trades above that, these relative equal highs right here will be the draw throughout the day or into next week.
*   **Overall Bias:** Still not changing or upsetting the apple cart for lower prices, as I still think the dollar is bullish.
*   **Study Recommendations:** When you have your chart allowing for observation of these things like this it's a little bit easier to see it Okay, so Uh that's what we trade up into look at your London session study that break that down look for silver bullets look for stop hunts then displacement and then a 30C fair value gap uh those types of things are all throughout this morning trading up into this inefficiency now again if you're the first time viewer and this is the first time you watch this video if it's past the time I'm live streaming right now or if you're watching the live stream live with us and you're seeing me talk about these things and think well you know this already happened go back and watch the live streams on Wednesday okay I gave very specific things that I wanted to see that day and then what I wanted to see on Thursday's trading we would be going higher it's reasonable to see it trade higher so it's unre it's it's unreasonable for someone to come in and say well you know this is useless information because it's after the fact when I many times before the fact Point things out whether it be on Twitter you know calling out levels calling out what it should reach for and I give you the context as of why I believe so when I'm doing the analysis or or commentary over the charts so it kind of it gives you like a comprehensive uh experience as not just say here's where I think it's going to go because I'm not trying to provide signals I'm trying to teach you a mindset so that way you can use the concepts of freely taught on this YouTube channel so that way you can go out and find your own model your own setup and be consistent with it and not require handh holding by me or anyone else which should be the Target goal for every Trader that have an independent mindset all right so like I said we've been FC through this whole thing and it's been really nice to be able to see that happen yesterday delivered like Gang Busters.

### **Cable (GBP/USD) Analysis**

*   **Background Noise:** Apologies if you heard my wife yelling at one of my Boxers.
*   **Weekly Chart:** This won't make sense if you haven't seen Wednesday's streams.
*   **Weekly Inefficiency:** The inefficiency here on the weekly chart (week of March 13th, 2023) is the buy balance sell-side inefficiency fair value gap, and price traded down into that.
*   **Wednesday's Target:** I mentioned on Wednesday I wanted to see a trade down to the low of that inefficiency, and we got one little pipet or something below it.
*   **Candle High and Low:**

    *   **High of the candle (March 10th):** 1.21137
    *   **Low of the mentioned candle:** Just a little bit below it (Candlestick tail only, not the body).
*   **Consequent Encouragement:** The bodies are basically around the consequent encouragement (midpoint of any fair value gap or inefficiency).
*   **Thursday's Action:** We saw a trade higher on Thursday and follow-through today.
*   **Wick and Inefficiency:** We traded right up into the consequent encouragement of this wick. The inefficiency is just above this old low.
*   **Shaded Area:** The shaded area is not a misplaced fair value gap box.
*   **Context from Weekly Chart:** It relates to something on the weekly chart. It's the upper portion of this inefficiency between this candle's low and that candle's high.
*   **Range of Candles:** The range between these two candles, bracketing it, is what I'm watching. I want the upper portion of that range to stay unfilled.
*   **Importance of Open Range:** I don't want to see price come all the way back up to this candle's low because, as long as that stays true, I believe we're going lower on pound dollar.
*   **Alternative Scenario:** Can it go up here and repic to that and then eventually go lower yeah but the probabilities shift much further away from likelihood versus um more consolidation and maybe even a deeper retracement into this one which is why I like to see this stay open in this upper half okay so that way you understand the context of why that box is on the daily chart now right here so same drill you want to look at what London did last night for today and then uh what we TR what we traded and did yesterday on cable uh using silver bullets at you know London session New York session am and then how we had price drop into this consequent encroachment of this Wick [Music] here there you go so that's that's a nice good study to do over the weekend if you don't have time to do it right now because you may be at school work or about to go to bed.

### **Gold (XAU/USD) Analysis**

*   **Order Block:** The order block starts at this candle on the daily chart. These two consecutive down-closed candles make the bullish order block before this displacement to the upside.
*   **Inefficiency:** There's an inefficiency in here.
*   **Targets:** We talked about how this gap from this candlestick's low and this candlestick's high, wanted to see it trade to the completion of this, and if it got overzealous, we could get down here and touch the order block.
*   **High of the Candle:** 1858,jpg

*   **Analysis Accuracy:** Also delivered handsomely on the analysis from Wednesday.
*   **No Reversal Claims:** I'm not suggesting any of these have reversed; I'm sticking with the higher timeframe ideas.
*   **Higher Dollar Scenario:** If the dollar resumes going higher (e.g., towards the latter part of next week), look down here because right over here is where I'm liking the idea of gold reaching for that.
*   **Intermediate-Term Target:** Right below there is where I like to see an intermediate-term target for gold.
*   **Mindset Change Factors:** I told you on the Wednesday live streams what would change my mind about it.

### **Aussie (AUD/USD) Quick Update**

*   **Low Upset:** I mentioned I wanted to see Aussie kind of upset its lows, and it did.
*   **Price Action:** It went down, took those sell-side right there, and then look at the reaction there.
*   **Potential Buy-Side Target:** There's buy-side resting right above here.
*   **Intraday Scalping Idea:** If you're an intraday scalper and you want to use the news this morning.

    *   We have this here overzealous price takes us up into that easy low hanging fruit dollar moves lower continuously on the news at 8:30 and or 10,
    *   **Potential target:** 0.6525 for a run for buy-side (not a lot of pips, but tradeable on a demo account or through tape reading).
*   **Disclaimer:** I might be wrong.

### **E-mini S&P (ES) Analysis**

*   Here is the E mini S&P December contract I want to

### **E-mini S&P (ES) Analysis - Continued**

I'll try to quickly get through this because I want to watch the **8:30 AM** news reaction on NASDAQ and ES with you live, but I'll close the live stream around **8:45 AM**.

*   **Retracement Expectation:** I mentioned how we could come back up and retrace.
*   **Highs Unswept:** I don't want to see these two highs swept because I like the fact that we came up right to consequent encroachment on this wick.
    *   Half of that wick is where it went right to, and then we had that turn, which is classic price delivery.
    *   We went over and overshot this inefficiency and traded down into the order block here.
    *   I'll add that level so you can see we dug into that and into this inefficiency here once more.
*   **Target:** I want to see it get down below here, but as I mentioned on Wednesday, this is a balanced price range, much like it was with the NASDAQ.
*   **Balanced Price Range Dynamics:** A balanced price range takes a lot of energy to get through.
    *   Price delivery is always algorithmic or by means of manual intervention (central bank or the "hand," quote unquote, market makers).
    *   These market makers aren't the ones you hear named or have a title given to them at some kind of trading firm. They're dealers dealing in a price feed they don't make. This doesn't make them a market maker, but a dealer.
    *   The folks that actually originate price and deliver price are the central banks – that comes from them, the top tier, the origin.
*   **Price Delivery:** When we see how price delivers to these objectives and it's met with an area like this back and forth, this is a balanced price range.
    *   It's going to take a much more meaningful price run to get through this.
    *   Many times, it won't do it on one single pass, so you have to allow for it to go down a little, come back up, go down a little deeper into it, come back up a little deeper into it.
*   **Trading Balanced Price Ranges:** It's not a low resistance liquidity run to trade *through* a balanced price range. It is a low resistance run to trade *to* a balanced price range.
    *   When you're above it, we're trading down.
*   **Retracement Expectation:** Since we hit all of our objectives on the S&P and more, it's reasonable to expect a Thursday/Friday retracement, but not call the bottom of the marketplace. That's really important to understand.

### **E-mini S&P (ES) - Hourly Chart**

*   I mentioned how we would go into and upset these highs in here.
*   We dug into that.
*   **Inefficiency:** There's a small little inefficiency right there between this candle's low and this candle's high.
*   You've got to start moving your charts around so you can see them better. If you keep your charts so squinched or you only show so many candlesticks, you're missing a lot of the details.
*   **Thursday's Price Action:** Price comes down into that on Thursday with the expectation of what I was outlining on Thursday is that we would see price retrace and move higher, seeking buy-side liquidity.
    *   They're going to set traps for traders that think that this is going down now because they have all these days behind them where it's gone down.
    *   Now they finally get into the mindset that, okay, it's going to go lower.
    *   I was taking your attention to the buy-side.
*   **Potential Targets:** There's a small, clean area in here. You might want to look at that this morning, and overzealous delivery will take us up into right there.
    *   We could see price reach for these for the **8:30 AM** news and/or **10:00 AM** news.
    *   It could reach **4367**.
    *   If you can look at something on the lower time frames, like the tapy de study, that's something you can look at for today.

### **NASDAQ (NQ) Analysis**

*   This one here was the strongest between the two indices on the upside, so it's not surprising to see it be the laggard going lower.
*   While it did take out our relative equal lows, which we've been aiming for, and this quarterly shift objective, which is this buy balance inefficiency, we want to see a trade into this big up-close candle.
*   We got down to it here on Wednesday, and as I mentioned, it could retrace right above these relative equal highs. Go back and watch the live streams.
*   **Not Calling a Bottom:** I'm not trying to convey the idea that I believe the low is in place. I don't suspect that at all.
    *   We've dropped a lot. There is an inefficiency here.
    *   There is a wick here that people that like to see things like this think that's a doji – it's bearish.
    *   They're going to put stops above that. It's perfectly reasonable and acceptable.
    *   It's common practice for the market to want to go back up, take a pull of liquidity out on the daily chart that would be opposing the longer-term or intermediate-term targets.
*   **Potential to go Lower:** In this case, I'm submitting to you that we could still go lower, and I'm willing to allow the market to tell me I'm wrong on the daily chart, which is fine. I don't care.
*   **No Trading Today:** I'm not going to trade today; I didn't trade yesterday. So I'm waiting for more information.
*   **Reason for No Trading:** All of my targets were met. All of them were met. I'm content and happy. I don't need to tell you anything more because it happened.
*   **Thursday's Prediction:** On the day that I wasn't going to trade, which was yesterday, I told you what to expect, and it happened in your charts.
*   **Importance of Contentment:** You want to get real comfortable with also being content with enough.
*   **Understanding Fair Value Gaps:** If you have an idea, here's a fair value gap, much like I was outlining on the S&P before we traded here.
*   **Inefficiency on the Daily Chart:** The inefficiency on the daily chart is up there, buy-side, because NASDAQ can be a little bit accelerated and animated much more than the S&P.
*   **Target:** 15,028 to the inefficiency up here. Excuse me, small little Gap here.

### **NASDAQ: Hypothetical Scenario**

*   We dropped down into that ahead of the **8:30 AM** scenario that I would expect, but I'm not trying to sell you on the idea to risk money or trade your combine or try to pass a challenge on this.
*   Let's play devil's advocate for a moment and say ICT was making the market for today.
    *   I would use the numbers that just came out and send us up into taking out the buy-side above **15,028**, maybe trade up into here.
    *   Then, at the consumer sentiment number, send this back lower, not to close on the low of the day.
    *   But to run against all the movement from today's price action, at least 50% of the daily range if it gets up to here.
    *   I would do that very thing at **10:00 AM** on the news release there.
*   **Study Ideas:** These are just ideas for you to study and look at price action through that lens.
*   **Disclaimer:** It doesn't mean I'm going to be right. It doesn't mean that you should be trading with real money.
*   **Purpose:** I'm just giving you something to study going forward because I don't have anything I'm going to put money on today.
*   **Risk Aversion:** I don't have anything that I think that you should risk money on because it's Friday.
*   **Good Practice:** It's a very good practice to end a good run with analysis, real trades, whether it's in your funded account challenge, whether it be in your funded account, whether it be in your live account, demo paper trading tape reading, if you had a good run like we've had for the last well months really sit still just relax just settle down.
*   **Optimal Trading Periods:** October is a really good month for price action, and the delivery for October and the first half of November are just one of the sweetest times in price action.
*   **Importance of Patience:** We've had a lot of things move in our favor, so it's really important for you just to settle down and let the new opportunities present themselves. Don't be in a rush to get into what's next.
*   **Emotional Awareness:** This was great; I need another hit. This high is wearing off; my sugar high is wearing off. Give me something else. You get all hopped up on ICT.
*   **Trader Mindset:** A neophyte, a gambler, a new trader all always is excited about what's the next thing. A professional is minding their business and also studying what they just did.
    *   Did they do all things correctly? Did they follow their processes? Did they follow their model?
    *   Are they feeling impulsive? Are they trying to chase a new high, a new Equity High, a new emotional High, a new psychological barrier to be breached, so that way they can feel like a champion?
*   **Professional vs. Amateur:** Professionally minded traders don't think that way. Neophytes, Instagram traders, the type of people – they are experience-driven for the sake of the experience versus the sake of following the model and being sober-minded in their decision-making.
*   **Contrast in Mindsets:** It's a stark contrast between the two.
*   **Emotional State:** If you feel impulsive, if you feel excited about taking a new trade or finding a new setup, your mindset is not in its right place.
    *   It needs to be boring. It needs to be absolutely boring.
*   **Market Closure Celebration:** Once you do all the right things all week long, and the market's close, and you can't push the button and do something reckless or lose money or trade outside your model on the weekends, then you celebrate.
    *   Then you allow the emotions to come in because they can't influence you in a market trade.
*   **Social Media Awareness:** I'm not saying that you shouldn't celebrate, that you shouldn't peacock around and celebrate with your friends and family or social media family, but do that in an area where you can't feel good or hear something that would be highly critical, and then you want to go out there and give yourself a feel-good moment by doing something by pushing a button that has nothing to do with your model.
*   **Reasoning:** That's the only reason why I'm coaching you to do this.
*   **Anticipating Criticism:** I'm certain that on Twitter somebody later today is going to say, "ICT said don't trade, and look at what I did today."
    *   That's a weak-minded person.
    *   That's somebody that absolutely probably just did something cherry-picked and/or doesn't have consistent profitability, and they just want to feel good about themselves and tell somebody else in a position that's acting as a teacher as a mentor something contrarian because they don't want to listen to Sound Logic either.
*   **Rebellious Trading:** To reward that Rebellion, that rebellious mindset, they'll do something that they didn't really risk money on, but then they'll take that and they'll toss it in the ring and say, "but look at this."
*   **Misinterpretations:** Just like folks will say, "I teach, don't trade on Mondays or don't trade on Fridays."
    *   That's not true.
    *   There are many times I'm telling you to trade on Mondays.
    *   The time when you can trade on Mondays is on non-farm payroll that week of trading – that's a definite Monday trading day.
*   **FOMC Announcements:** Apart from that, the only other time is if there's a FOMC announcement rate announcement, that type of thing later in the week, usually a Wednesday or Thursday, that's a definite trade on Monday. That's a definite, absolutely.
    *   I'm going in there, and I'm pushing a button, and I'm trying to make real money – that's the way it is.
    *   That's what my students understand.
*   **Out of Context Narratives:** When you take one thing that maybe a sound bite or a clip or something I taken and put into a tweet and you take completely out of context, it's easy for these individuals to run around with these false narratives and say I said this or I said that or this is what I believe about the market or you shouldn't or shouldn't do this.
*   **Proper Mentorship:** That's what being mentored is properly done. You have to spend time with that person that's teaching you. You just can't watch one video or you know, read a few tweets or an opinion or opinions of people out there that are failed traitors, and nobody really cares about their opinion, but they want to stir up drama for the argumentative side that would be opposing what is that I'm teaching or anybody else's stuff for that matter.
*   **Troll Behavior:** That's why Trolls Exist. Trolls Exist because they suck. They're not able to do anything themselves, and they want to detract so that makes them significant.
*   **Post-Run Trading:** In these periods after we've had a really good run, you want to sit and really Forge this confidence that it will provide you if you allow it by not chasing the next opportunity because it might not be there today.
    *   It could be; it could be a huge run and be completely against what I'm suggesting.
*   **Potential Market Scenarios:** That might be a good study here. It may not even go up to **15,028** at all.
    *   This could have already made the high here at the **8:30 AM** news, and then **10:30 AM**, we run lower and go for the sell-side down here or here, and there it is.
*   **Confidence in Analysis:** How am I going to lose any money on that? I'm not. How am I going to lose face and clout as an educator if that happens? I'm not because I told you I'm not trading, and I'm telling you why I'm not trading because I'm content.
*   **Consistent Accuracy:** My analysis has been bang on, like it's been straight right to the point, getting right to the targets, and it's been behaving like that long.
*   **Student Development:** You, as a developing student, need to sit and look at the charts and think about what we have anticipated before the fact and how it delivered.
*   **Confidence Building:** That is confidence building. It's not meant to be arrogant.
*   **Humility:** It's not meant for you to go into other people's live streams or YouTube comment sections or their Twitter and tell them that they're trading something less than Superior because you're trading with this information that stuff needs to stop.
*   **Seeking Significance:** It's the same thing that I was just talking about. You're trying to create significance in yourself on the wrong pretense.
    *   You're trying to use this new skill set that you're requiring, and you're trying to treat it like a sharp stick so you can go around and poke everybody with it.
*   **Focus on Personal Success:** Nobody cares, especially if they're making money. They don't care what you're trading if it works or not.
    *   If someone's making money, they have a model, and if they're wise, they won't try to change it, and nothing's going to make them want to do anything to change their model.
*   **Professional Trader Mindset:** That's a professionally minded trader – that's what I'm trying to secure in your thought process.
*   **Model Simplicity:** Once you get a model and you make it as simple as possible, you're not trying to bring all the moving parts that I offer in terms of teaching.
    *   You make a very simple approach to trading. You know when you're looking for it, what time of the day you're trading it, what instrument you're going to trade, what Market, what time frame, and you're just going to mind your own business and work in that little small little area, and when you get a setup, you're all over it.
*   **Accepting Losses:** If you have a setup and you lose, no problem. It doesn't mean the model's broken. It doesn't mean you go out there and get somebody to Pat you on the back and say, "don't worry, honey, it's going to be okay."
*   **Personal Responsibility:** That's not necessary with a professionally minded Trader. They accept the fact that there's going to be losing trades. They accept the fact that as the mechanic, the person behind the operator of the model, the person pushing the button, the responsibility solely rests on them versus someone that wants to blame anyone and everything outside of themselves because they're not personally responsible.

### **NASDAQ: 5-Minute Chart Analysis**

*   Let's drop down here into a five-minute chart and see what this thing is trying to do here.
*   It still could pump up there that 15,028. Let's see if it will do it all right.
*   See that Wick right here. We're hovering right around...

*   We're hovering right around the halfway point or **consequent encroachment**. The fact that this candle closed above it, I would like to see it not trade back down to the lower end or lower half of that wick. I'd like to see it expand up and drive into that level right there.
*   We're on a five-minute chart, so okay, see how we're hovering around that. This candle closed above it. When I see that, and I have an objective or a draw in liquidity that's likely to be a reason for the market to want to draw up to, and this is reversed too.
*   When I'm bearish, and there's a big candle like this, when I see that, and then the very next candle, I'm watching whatever the time frame is, it's all respective to whatever time frame you're watching. So it's not limited just to a five-minute chart.
*   It's universal. It's something that I would expect in reading any time frame. So if I'm watching like a 15-second chart, whether I'm watching a one-minute chart or an hourly chart, whatever time frame, if I have the draw and liquidity in mind that I'd like to see deliver, if that's what's in my mind, I think it could reach for, and we see a wick like this.

### **Market Perception vs. Algorithmic Repricing**

*   Many other traders would see this as scary and problematic, like it could potentially start the reverse. I don't subscribe to that view, and I get further along in my belief that the algorithm will reprice those buy stops here.
*   If this candle that's immediately after the wick forms, if it can close above the midpoint of that, it just means that there's potential for follow-through.

### **Short-Term Scalping Strategy**

*   Now, there are two things you can do with that information. You can do it as a, if you're a real, real, real short-term scalper, you can do things like this.
*   Watch, I'll go into a one-minute chart, and while price was hitting this right here, a real small, ultra-short-term high-frequency trading algorithm would be to be buying it when it hit here and then using this high as your target.
*   Do, do like a half a point. Since we're doing futures, like a half a point below that, your limit order would be there, and that in itself, you're doing more than most people on social media if you could just do that.
*   Most people don't have an ability to find where price should gravitate to, where it should turn around, what real support and resistance would be looking like.

### **Critique of Classical Support and Resistance**

*   If you follow the stuff that's in books that classically define support and resistance, that to me is random, okay, because there's so many different interpretations of what support and resistance should be, and they don't all behave the same way.
*   One of the things that I tried to do over the years is to try to create a language where I can communicate to myself in my journaling, and also when I was younger, expecting to be a father at some time, right?
*   If I had children, you know, how could I talk to them and communicate a way where these candlesticks tell a story, and there's a narrative behind what it is that they're doing, and that way, we don't fall victim to just, you know, moving around for the sake of, you know, short-term randomness.

### **Understanding Time Distortion**

*   I do believe, like, in very, very small time frames, when in consolidations, that's where, I guess, quote unquote, randomness can occur because during those periods, it's time distortion.
*   Time distortion is where the market is not being permitted to move. It's not being allowed to displace higher or lower and start running.
*   In these very, very small time frames, sub-five minutes or whatever, and you get these little consolidations in price action, that is time distortion. It's being held for a news event to hit the marketplace.
*   It's being held for a session close. Like, if you watch how the last few minutes of trading, you know, after 4:00 PM in the New York session, many times, you'll see the market just start marking time, basically just going sideways, isn't doing anything.
*   That's time distortion. The algorithm is not operating anymore. It's just they set a range high, and they set a range low, and they just let it meander back and forth.
*   It's not seeking liquidity there. It's not going after anybody's stops. Buying and selling pressure has no influence over it. It's just simply limiting its range in delivery. That's it. It's done.

### **Algorithmic Liquidity Seeking**

*   During market hours, the algorithm will absolutely be seeking liquidity. It will be running off of macros. These are short little scripts in market code, okay?
*   All these things will be firing, causing price to move, and it has nothing to do with how many people bought it or how many people sold it, all right?

### **Real-Time Price Action Analysis**

*   Look at the reaction there. We went just above that wick here, just by a little bit. We're pulling back, and now look at all of this run here. Look at all this price delivery right there.
*   Is there any inefficiency? Make it a little bit larger so you can see. From this candle's high right here, down to that low, is there any inefficiencies in price, fair value gaps, is basically what I'm saying?
*   From this candle to this candle, no. From this candle to the left, no. From this candle to the left, no. From this candle to this, yes, you see it? That small little one right here, see that? This is the only inefficiency in this price run here.
*   This one's kind of like the same. Let me see what the high is on that one. The high is 80 and a half. The low is, and it's even, so there's no inefficiency or no gap there, so it's an immediate rebalance.

### **Immediate Rebalance and Price Delivery**

*   Which is perfect for me to segue read into that, started the run here, open traded down. Whenever we see this, this is one of the things I teach, it's an immediate rebalance.
*   You're not going to see that in any kind of books, Chris Lori don't even talk about it. I know a lot of people try to say I teach this stuff, it's not, and you don't see Chris Lori coming out here doing this, but that is an immediate rebalance.
*   That means it's as soon as it does that, you're going to see sudden price delivery real quick.
*   Does that look like it want to get somewhere after it did an immediate rebalance? Of course, it does. Where's it going to go to? That high.
*   We can anticipate an entry here, a pyramid entry here, or if you missed this run as I outlined live, that it's consolidating around that consequent encroachment of the higher time frame candlestick wick. That's what I was measuring on that and came down HD. It rallied up just to take out the high. It did so here, no inefficiencies at all.

### **Anticipating Market Movements**

*   I want to see, personally, I want to see price stay above consequent encroachment. That'll tell me this is where we're going to run for at the 9:30.
*   If we break down below it, then it's probably going to need to trade into this area here, which is of no consequence to me because I could care less.
*   Say I was trading this morning, and I wanted to trade the New York opening bell at 9:30 to 10:00, and I wanted to do something, okay, or I wanted to tape read, okay, or I wanted to do a demo account execution for practice, and I don't want to take real risk, or I just want to sit down.
*   My youngest son's not with me this morning, but if I wanted to sit with him and practice executions and or reading the tape with him, I would use the information I'm showing you here for 9:30 for this run up here.
*   The higher probability trade setup would be for price to stay, and it can do what it just did there. It can wick down below that, but just I don't want to see the close of that candle.
*   See where it stopped? See that? It stopped right there. That's good. I like that. But if it traded down and closed below that, then this is a factor that needs to be revisited.
*   That right there, that close, and look at the reaction right there. That little response right there, that's an algorithm that's doing that. That's not buyers and sellers, okay?

### **Signatures in Price and PD Arrays**

*   That's these things I'm talking about. That is a signature in price, and when you know where you're supposed to be expecting them to form, when to anticipate their delivery, what they should be performing, what should they offer in terms of support or resistance, should it incite the algorithm to start repricing to a specific direction or a specific price level, and these PD arrays in the right narrative so that way when you understand what price is likely to do.
*   It'll tell you how fast it should deliver, like should it be a slow, meandering delivery where it just keeps on creeping, or does it go like, well, you runs real quick and takes off?

### **The Value of Live Market Observation**

*   That part, like I can't write a book that's going to be able to clearly show you that. Like, you have to see it live. You have to see examples of it, and when I do execution, even when it was in demo, the purposes were for you to go back and study and see where those things are that repeat that I teach and how does that how is that used in price for that particular trade, what elements of the things that I teach in price action were in that trade setup that I took, and for a long time people were complaining about how it's demo, demo, demo, it only works in demo.
*   Apparently, then I started trading with a real account, and then there's crickets, so you're never going to be able to satisfy everybody.
*   I like the idea that this candlestick came down just about half of that candlestick, that would be mean threshold because we're talking about a body, so it's not an inefficiency, but because it's Friday, because it's a day I'm trying to remind you not to take this though, I know some of you right now are pushing buttons because you hear me talking and you and you are being convinced that what I'm saying here is just enough for you to get into a trade, I'm telling you don't do that, don't do that.

### **Friday Trading Cautions**

*   This is the part that I didn't want to do this morning, but I'm trying to be generous to you because I wasn't with y'all yesterday.
*   In a perfect world, it should run higher right from here. If it were, say it was a Thursday, not Friday, I would already be net long, and my limit order would be just below here, and I would have a best-case scenario up into this up here. That's how I would handle that.
*   But it's Friday. I'm not trading it. I'm not live. You're not going to have a, you know, here's a dose. I was secretly doing my trade. I wouldn't. I'm not doing that here. I'm just telling you how to read, how to practice it, and use the day without taking on risk.

### **Ideal Scenarios for Practice and Learning**

*   The best-case scenario would be to stay above in this range here prior to 9:30, and if it does that, then I would like to see price run this area here after 9 at 9:30 or just after 9:30 going into 10:00, but then at 10:00, I think that we could see it retrace, you know, throughout the remainder of the PM session and go lower and attack all the price delivery that we've seen so far from the London hours all the way through to pre-market.
*   Some of you folks just thought that it was going to be, I'm going to open up an account, I'm going to be able to just walk out here and start making money, this is going to be easy.
*   A lot of things you got to weigh out is it that's why it's difficult. It's the hardest easy money you'll ever make.

### **High-Impact News Drivers and Market Manipulation**

*   Another thing for your notes today: whenever you have two high-impact news drivers I apologize whenever there's two high-impact news drivers in the same session, like we have an 8:30 news driver that just has already hit the market at 8:30, and then we have one at 10:00, whenever that happens, whenever that's in the economic calendar, my mind immediately goes to in case you're wondering like why would I say 10:00 news should be used to go against everything that's going on, think about it like this.
*   If, if, if a terrorist was going to lay a bomb down, okay, and they do it this way, they go into a busy area where a marketplace or a storefront, and they set a small charge up, and when that charge goes off, what's going to happen?
*   Everybody's going to run away from that point of impact, right? And they all run to a location where the larger bomb is, so that way there's more casualties, okay?
*   In my mind, the way I internalize what they do is much like what I teach with FOMC, much like I teach with non-farm payroll, those are financial bombs, okay?
*   They're literally placed in the marketplace, they're algorithmically delivered, and what happens is one news driver sends price, you know, careening one direction, that's that first explosion, okay?

### **Analyzing Market Sentiment and Retail Trader Behavior**

*   At 8:30, what, what did price do down here running, right? We have a potential pool of liquidity up here where price could could gravitate to, right?
*   I'm suggesting to you as long as we're in the upper [Music] half as long as we're in this area here going into 9:30, I favored the idea that we could run up in here and sweep that out, and it on some kind of momentum overzealous price delivery, you know, best-case scenario would be up into this area here, this inefficiency on the higher time frame, but I'm not willing to take that trade today because it's Friday, and it's it's going against my mindset about I'm I'm content with what I've done, and if I did something this morning, and it wasn't profitable, or if I outline something and call it like on Twitter, and it doesn't pan out, it'll be in my head all weekend when I knew I shouldn't have touched it, I wouldn't I shouldn't have done it, so hearing me talk about it live over the chart that way it gives you a little bit more understanding why I'm not taking the trade, but I'm also using the opportunity to teach you real time what I would do if it was say like a Thursday where wasn't the end of the week, okay?
*   That 10:00 news driver and price running up to this level here and maybe maybe oops spiking up Beyond it to get in this inefficiency here, I would use if I was making the market, I would use the 10:00 hour that news and the sentiment after seeing Traders see it you ring from 8:30, and at uh 10:00, you know, we see it going higher, what is the public going to do, what's the street money going to be thinking, Street money is going to be like, I want to be long, right?
*   I want to be long. That's the very logic that I used on Wednesday to explain to you why we're trading where we're at right now through Thursday and now Friday's initial trading because I'm waiting for those wrestling matches when the sentiment of retail, the collective that is called retail trading, the street money, the quote unquote dumb money, and I don't mean that to be ignorant, but that's just what it is, I mean I came from that too, right?
*   Everybody is that when they first start, I'm waiting for the time period where what I'm anticipating that the algorithm will do, how it runs on specific narratives and its macros and the time of day it does certain things using the economic calendar just like a TV Guide, okay?
*   You can you can anticipate the sentiment shifts that the retail Trader and collectively the Traders will think in how their they will perceive price before it even happens, so you're really not only predicting the future, but you're reading other people's minds in the future, which is an amazing skill set to have, and that's why this industry is so fascinating because it's really a study of psychology, it's more a study of psychology than it is of uh a game of chance or risk, and I think if you approach your your initial stages of learning with that mindset that approach the internalizing how pric is being booked and why it would be booked like that what what would be the instigation of price doing a specific thing what would be the the Catalyst what would be the driver of it doing that very thing thing what would be the cause and effect what would be the repercussions of price doing a very specific thing and how would the losing crowd the the retail minded Trader how would


Here's the organized and refined version of the provided text, maintaining all details, context, and nuances:

### **The Retail Trader Mindset vs. Proprietary Trading**

*   Even large fund managers often rely on retail trading concepts, applying them on a larger scale and higher time frames. They allow more time for the market to move in their favor.
*   Proprietary firms with their own algorithms that trade short-term price fluctuations don't use retail logic, but rather frameworks centered around taking bite-sized pieces of the market.

### **The "Bite-Sized Pieces" Analogy**

*   Analogy: A small "fish" (possibly a type of shark) in the ocean quickly attacks larger creatures, taking a perfect circular bite and retreating. It does this to anything from killer whales to tuna. This "fish" sustains itself by getting one bite at a time.
*   Proprietary algorithms operate similarly, entering the market to take small bites when opportunities arise.
*   Long-term hedge fund managers, conversely, seek large, long-term price swings to ensure a slow, smooth equity curve for their clients, avoiding constant fluctuations.

### **Speculators and Volatility**

*   As a speculator, you invite volatility, accepting that your account will fluctuate as you aim to capture big, explosive price runs.
*   However, you will incur losses from the "little fish" that take small bites out of your account.
*   It's unrealistic to think you won't experience losses.

### **Realistic Expectations and Market Dynamics**

*   You have to accept occasional losses.
*   If you can get through most of the month and only break even on the last day, you are doing better than most traders.
*   Most traders are at a net loss once they start using a live account.
*   Realistic expectations and time are needed to learn the market.
*   Focus on understanding how the market should book and the motivations of different participants.

### **Understanding Market Participants**

*   Identify who would gain from the market delivering a specific way.
*   Consider who would be hurt and why.
*   Understand how one group's loss can be used advantageously by another.
*   Comprehend the narratives driving price action.

### **Navigating Uncertainty in Trading**

*   There will be days where opportunities seem abundant, but uncertainty arises as soon as you enter the market.
*   If you are new to trading and this happens, immediately cut your risk in half.
*   If you can't reduce the risk because you're using the smallest lot size, close the trade.
*   It's not beneficial in the early stages to wrestle with uncertainty, as it can damage your capital.
*   Accept that losses are part of the business.

### **The Ocean Analogy: Trading Dangers**

*   Trading is like being in the ocean with creatures that have teeth; you will lose limbs and fingers.
*   You must find a way to swim and survive, or the "bottom feeders" will consume you.
*   You can't avoid getting "bitten" eventually.

### **Prioritizing Capital Preservation**

*   Avoid thinking that everything must be one-sided in your trades.
*   If a trade becomes less certain, your first thought should be to preserve capital.
*   If a trade isn't performing as expected but you're not convinced it's entirely wrong, cut the trade in half.
*   If you can't cut it in half, close it and observe without risk.
*   Mental capital is often more important than financial capital, as the latter can be replaced more easily (e.g., through a second job).
*   Avoid undermining your model due to one event.
*   A single losing trade doesn't invalidate the efficacy of a trading strategy.

### **Addressing Common Trading Fears**

*   Short-term adversities don't mean the algorithm is changing or that ICT's teachings are becoming ineffective.
*   The underlying mechanics of how prices book are not changing.
*   Trust the process.

### **Friday Market Observations**

*   A candlestick closed below a certain level but didn't touch a small inefficiency.
*   It is Friday, so trading is approached cautiously.
*   Wicks have poked above a certain high multiple times, but bodies haven't breached it.

### **Model 2022 and High-Impact News**

*   Some might see a setup as Model 2022 (a shift in market structure followed by a short entry at a fair value gap), but this logic should be avoided due to a looming 10:00 high-impact news driver.
*   The market could squeeze even higher.
*   Longer term, the market has been trending down, so it could be advantageous for the market to run buy stops above these highs, which could then be used for short entries.

### **Two High-Impact News Drivers in the Same Session**

*   When two high-impact news drivers occur in the same session, there is a two-stage delivery: one to spur on a move or continue an existing trend.
*   In this case, London hours saw a rally and retracement into an inefficiency.
*   The 8:30 news driver was used to continue what was already in play since London.

### **Friday Caution and Potential Market Manipulation**

*   Due to the 10:00 news and it being Friday, caution is warranted.
*   The 10:00 news could be used to push price even higher, squeezing up to trail buy stops for liquidity.
*   If the market is going lower than Wednesday's low, as believed, this would be advantageous for smart money to buy at a higher price.

### **Contentment with Being Wrong and Trusting the Logic**

*   It's okay to miss a move if it means trusting the trading logic.
*   Being right or wrong has zero to do with trading profitably.
*   The goal is to keep money in your account even when wrong.

### **Preserving Capital and Avoiding Toxic Thinking**

*   Think about preserving capital.
*   Many only think about it when they are in a trade without a stop loss.
*   With impeccable risk management and stop losses, even with the precise teachings, one can still undo themself due to character flaws.
*   Avoid over-leveraging.

### **Long-Term Perspective and Comfort in Trading**

*   Preserving capital throughout the year allows one to be profitable if they stay in the game long enough for the good trades to materialize.
*   Be comfortable and content in the trade.
*   There should be no better market or opportunity you need to be worrying about.


Here's a structured and detailed breakdown of the provided text, enhanced for readability and clarity, while maintaining all original content and nuances.

### **Mentorship and the Pursuit of Shortcuts**

*   There are no other time frames, setups, models, ICT posts, tweets, videos, or instructional materials that one needs to worry about beyond what is currently being discussed.
*   There is nothing missing from the current lesson.
*   A retweet was made of someone asking about the most important things from the **2023 Mentorship**.
*   The essence of the question was: "Give me a shortcut; I don't want to waste my time."
*   Those with that mentality should not watch the speaker's content.
*   That mentality indicates a weak-minded individual.
*   The speaker is not offering a "dollar menu mentorship" or a "drive-thru" experience.
*   This isn't **McDonald's**, and the speaker is not a clown.
*   The speaker is teaching people how to make real money, which involves many rules, steps, and time.
*   The speaker has zero tolerance for shortcut-seeking questions and mutes those who ask them.
*   These individuals are not interested in learning but rather in performing a "magic trick" for overnight success.
*   Trading is complex and requires weighing various factors, for which many are not equipped.
*   Many individuals can't manage risk or even balance a checkbook, yet they want to trade.
*   Some people are unaware of their own bank account balance, which is a scary proposition.
*   These individuals want a profitable trading journey without being financially responsible.

### **Market Analysis and Potential Scenarios**

*   There was a small run that didn't reach the speaker's desired level.
*   The speaker would have liked to see it hit a small inefficiency—a volume imbalance.
*   If the market overshoots, dropping further into the volume imbalance, that could happen.
*   The market could be whipsaw-y.
*   The speaker wants to observe market behavior between **9:30 AM** and **10:00 AM** during the news driver.
*   The speaker plans to leave before that time to be alone with their thoughts, without distractions.
*   The opening bell will be observed for about five minutes.
*   The speaker is not interested in a Model 2022 setup (shift in market structure, short entry at a fair value gap) due to the **10:00 AM** news driver, the fact that it is Friday, and the bearish sentiment.
*   The market could squeeze higher.
*   The speaker anticipates the market running buy stops above the highs to allow smart money to build short positions.

### **Commodities, Commitment of Traders, and Market Manipulation**

*   Refer to the commodity portion of the core content for a lesson on how smart money sells into rallies (**Month 10 core content** – speaker is unsure of the month).
*   The indices have already dropped significantly, making it reasonable for the market to rise on Thursday and Friday.
*   This upward movement could knock out profitable traders who trail their stop losses, allowing short sellers to establish positions.
*   The speaker analyzes *why* price should move to a certain level, rather than relying on patterns or indicators.
*   Traders often create a narrative when they get stopped out, blaming market makers.
*   The speaker tries to anticipate market maker actions to avoid being caught off guard.
*   The speaker views themselves as the market maker, aiming to take out other traders.
*   The speaker sees traders with buy stops as liquidity, a stepping stone to achieve their goals.
*   Market making is about consumption and survival of the fittest, not facilitating trade.

### **Comfort and Acceptance of Being Wrong**

*   If one had taken a short position, it might still work, but the speaker isn't certain.
*   The speaker accepts the possibility of being wrong.
*   The speaker believes the market will run higher to sell short into, with the expectation of lower prices in two weeks.
*   The speaker articulates their thought process for how they are looking at price right now.
*   Using the current pattern to go short is highly unlikely because of the enticing buy stops.

### **Anticipating Market Reactions and Liquidity Grabs**

*   The market might run up to take out buy stops of traders seeing a bull flag pattern.
*   If the scenario plays out, shorts with protective buy stops will be stopped out at a loss.
*   Traders seeing a bull flag have buy stops to enter long, but the speaker believes they will have short-lived profits.
*   A **10:00 AM** news event could shift sentiment, leading to a downward move below recent lows.
*   The market may target buy stops to lure breakout traders into long positions, only to reverse and cause losses.
*   Would one feel comfortable with a short position right now, given pulls of liquidity?
*   The speaker would not attempt an early entry at this time due to the factors discussed.

### **Lessons, Logic, and Accuracy**

*   This is an advanced lesson that cannot be found in books or from other mentors.
*   In the early stages of development, one should focus on studying market logic and narrative without risking capital.
*   Analyze how the market uses existing orders above and below the marketplace, considering economic data.
*   The described setup was not a Model 2022.
*   The speaker filters out various scenarios when selecting trades, resulting in high accuracy.
*   This filtering process is why the speaker's Twitter calls are highly likely to occur.

### **Real-Time Market Observations**

*   Short-term buy-side liquidity has been taken.
*   The sell-side liquidity is located at a specific point.
*   The speaker highlights a small volume imbalance on the chart.
*   A volume imbalance is the separation between two consecutive candlesticks' bodies.
*   The market is whipsawing due to a second news driver in the same session.
*   The **8:30 AM** news event initiated the morning session, with another at **10:00 AM**.
*   Sentiment was short-term bullish after the London session and yesterday's trading.
*   The **8:30 AM** news sent the market higher.
*   The opening bell at **9:30 AM** cleared the buy-side and triggered breakout short sellers.
*   The speaker removes previous markings from the chart as they've served their purpose.
*   The location of the buy-side liquidity is noted.
*   Observe the consequent encroachment of the wick.
*   A close above that level would signal follow-through.
*   The reaction off the fair value gap is a high-frequency trade.
*   A candle's low precisely hits a specific price point (**14,985.75**).
*   Shorts were positioned below, looking to sell.

### **Navigating Choppy Markets and Journaling Observations**

*   The market will chop when you can't trade it unless you understand what you're looking for.
*   One must know when consolidation is likely to occur to avoid being victimized.
*   The speaker discusses how to use a specific pattern, mentioning an earlier instance where sell-side liquidity was taken.
*   Price traded down to a fair value gap and then stopped precisely at the tick before reversing.
*   Consequent encroachment occurs, but it's not necessary to take out the high.
*   There is enough range to potentially extract ten handles.
*   Trading is not recommended on this specific day.
*   The situation is suitable for journaling, observation, and logging.
*   This lesson isn't particularly exciting.


Here's a structured and detailed breakdown of the provided text, enhanced for readability and clarity, while maintaining all original content and nuances.

### **Market Dynamics and Avoiding Problematic Trading Conditions**

*   The speaker describes situations where the market "explodes" with directional bias at a "fevered pace," emphasizing the importance of learning to navigate these conditions.
*   These specific conditions are not usually discussed on Twitter.
*   The accuracy of the speaker's calls stems from *avoiding* discussing these challenging market phases.
*   These periods are described as "50/50," where the market could move in either direction.
*   It's crucial to avoid risking real money in such uncertain situations.
*   The goal is to identify situations where a specific market behavior is highly probable.

#### **Contingent Scenarios and the Importance of Context**

*   Under different circumstances (not Friday, no **10:00 AM** news), the speaker would consider selling short immediately upon hitting a low, anticipating a run below a specific point.
*   This action would involve taking partial profits and assessing potential acceleration.
*   However, due to the factors outlined (Friday and the looming news), the speaker is "on the brake pedal," not actively trading.
*   The speaker's aim is to provide insights and discourage impulsive trading.
*   Without identifying "Quicks" (problem areas), traders risk becoming victims.

#### **Trade Management and Range Evaluation**

*   On a typical day (not Friday, without the news), the speaker would close a short trade if the price quickly moved above the equilibrium of the range.
*   Rapid movement back to the midpoint suggests the potential for further price surges.
*   The speaker emphasizes the importance of re-watching the video to grasp these concepts.
*   This type of understanding is difficult to convey in books or short videos.

#### **Liquidity Engineering and Market Maker Intent**

*   Amidst the price fluctuations, the speaker notes an initial gap but expresses skepticism about its continuation.
*   The market's downward movements seem designed to entice short positions, building buy-side liquidity above the highs.
*   The speaker views this as "engineering" liquidity.
*   Remaining without a trade is acceptable if the current chart setup doesn't inspire confidence.
*   Traders should be able to identify potential manipulation areas.
*   The speaker claims these specific conditions are not clearly articulated in books or by other educators.
*   This is different from simply stating that markets may consolidate before events like FOMC.

#### **Two Economic Drivers**

*   The speaker anticipates whipsawing price action when two market drivers occur in the same session.
*   What seems apparent in the chart might be a trap, with the opposite outcome unfolding.
*   By **4:00 PM**, the real action becomes clear.
*   Traders who shorted on a break below, selling weakness, are likely feeling uncertain as the market rises.
*   Buy stops above are being used by bull flag traders, with stop losses placed below, which have already been triggered.
*   The market is "Seek and Destroy" for profit.
*   The major moves, targeting the majority of liquidity, will likely materialize around **10:00 AM**.
*   Traders focused on patterns may be caught off guard.

### **Personal Trading Experiences and Novel Teaching Concepts**

*   The speaker shares personal experiences of trading bonds and currency futures, recalling instances of repeated buying and selling leading to account depletion.
*   The speaker admits to self-deception, justifying losses by claiming they would have recovered if not stopped out prematurely.
*   Some trading days are "cleverly disguised impossibilities."
*   The speaker highlights the novelty of teaching *when not to trade*.

### **Pre-News Analysis and Market Predictions**

*   With less than 12 minutes until the **10:00 AM** news event, the speaker plans to observe the market independently.
*   The speaker anticipates a move above a "blue line," followed by a break below a recent low.
*   The speaker humorously thanks the market for "giving it to me beforehand."
*   Short positions have been "murdered," and breakout longs are not allowed to be profitable.
*   The market is trading towards a shaded area previously mentioned.

### **Post-Observation Reflections**

*   The speaker appreciates the market's cooperation with their schedule.
*   The intention is to provide insightful information and emphasize avoidance strategies.
*   Understanding price action, algorithm behavior, sentiment usage, and trader enticement are crucial elements of market narrative.
*   These elements are not found in books or courses but develop through extensive chart observation.
*   While a detailed understanding isn't necessary for basic profitability, it's essential for advanced precision and avoiding common pitfalls.

### **YouTube Content and Encouragement for Learning**

*   The speaker's YouTube content will remain available for learning purposes, even after their departure in November.
*   Viewers are encouraged to study, share, and even incorporate the material into homeschooling curricula.
*   The goal is to foster independent thinking and entrepreneurial skills, enabling individuals to create their own opportunities.
*   The speaker wishes everyone a safe weekend and will be available on Twitter the following morning.

### **Final Remarks**

*   The speaker concludes by encouraging viewers to enjoy the weekend and remain safe, signing off with a promise to connect on Twitter the following morning.

Okay, here's the organized and refined version of the provided text, retaining all details and nuances:

# **Dollar Index Weekly Chart Analysis and Market Sentiment**

## **Introduction and Welcome**

Well hello folks, just giving it a second here. Checking on Twitter to see if everything is visible. If you're watching, please send a tweet to confirm that you can see the dollar Index weekly chart. A 5x5 rating would be appreciated. Thank you to Wick Fisher, Earthy, and Elijah Pips for confirming.

### **Household Noise Disclaimer**

You may hear some household noises, including my wife, the little girls, and the puppies. I don't have the ability to edit it out as this is live. It will save me time.

## **Review of Previous Commentaries**

If you haven't watched the previous commentaries where I outlined what we're looking at, you're doing yourself a disservice. It's going to look like hindsight, like I’m cherry-picking, talking about what already happened from the safety of hindsight 2020, when in fact, we expected this.

### **Dollar Index Imbalance**

The dollar Index weekly chart shows an imbalance from this candle's low at **110.426** to this candle's high at **107.27.4**, with buy-side residing right above there. I don’t think we are done yet.

*   I mentioned that we would likely see it drop to the minimum of this candle's high. That's what this level is here. On lower time frames, you'll see that level.
*   Making the level broader so it pops on the chart. The buy-side was the initial draw, and we got that last week. This week, we drew up into that.

## **Addressing Weekend Commentary Concerns and Market Openings**

For those argumentative folks who question weekend commentary, when the market is closed:

*   I don't have a skill, a repertoire, a mechanism, a gizmo, or a procedure to forecast the Sunday opening price. Nobody will. It's a random function of wherever "they" (the collective hand that makes these markets) want to open the market.
*   There's no rhyme or reason to consistently forecast an opening price, something that could be derived as a model.
*   I have taken trades in the past, which I won't do anymore, because of the gap risk.

### **Risk Management and Intraday Trading**

Given the current global climate (new potential war, potential violence), I'm not willing to hold positions over the weekend.

*   More inclined to stay inside intraday trading.
*   In and out, surgical strikes, move to the sidelines. Not even trying to trade overnight into the next day.
*   Very rarely have I taken trades this year where I've held the position over the 5 PM settlement to 6 PM open. Maybe five or less real money trades this year.
*   It's the best way to trade now because of the inherent gap risk. Things can pop off at any time, sending the market into some crazy directional or whipsaw. This can upset a position that would otherwise be profitable.

### **Target Objective and Commentary Consistency**

The low-hanging fruit objective, once we cleared this buy-side, was this level right here. I mentioned this in last week’s commentary before Sunday's opening. I do this every single time I do a weekend commentary. I’ve done it for years in private mentorship.

*   **Important Note:** You can't join it, and I don't make videos for them anymore. I’m teaching publicly for free. Stop asking.
*   Don’t send me money. I'm not selling any mentorships. If anyone's pretending to be me selling mentorships or videos, they're scamming you.
*   People will say, "But you said this and that." In context, I said that because I don't know where we're going to open up for the week, which was here on Sunday's opening.

## **Non-Farm Payroll Week Protocol**

Going into non-farm payroll week, I have to make a concession because we are going into non-farm payroll, which is this week.

*   Long-term private mentorship students are aware of the protocol that I have taught them: try to make your money.
*   For those who say I teach not to trade on Mondays, that's not true. Every non-farm payroll week (economic number, employment data – typically the first Friday of every month) tends to be problematic for symmetry.
*   After Wednesday, it tends to be more difficult to have a one-sidedness to the marketplace where you can hold with a great deal. Speaking in terms of the mindset, skill set, and experience level of a new trader.
*   Clearly, I and well-versed veteran students can trade these days. We can trade non-farm payroll. You've seen me do it; I’ve live-streamed it; I've called it. It's all there.

### **Mentorship and Responsible Teaching**

I teach with a great deal of responsibility as a mentor and influencer.

*   I don't want anyone new to think they can just try to trade this market in this particular week every single month because it's going to be problematic.
*   You don't have the experience to see through some of the traps laid there before you. Over time, you'll learn what they are and can look past them.
*   I tell the neophytes, the brand new students, "Don't trade, don't trade." But those who have been with me for a while know better; they're going to trade and not listen to that because they understand the mentor in me is just guiding the new, inexperienced trader/student.
*   If you already know what you're doing, obviously, you're going to do what you're going to do. You're not coming to me for insights. Many times, you're probably not even watching my stuff until *after* you've done whatever you're doing, and you come back and say, "Okay, let's see what ICT said," not because you're hanging on every word I'm saying but because you have your own model now.
*   That's how you graduate with me. That's the goal.
*   There's no tethering for life with me. No commitment to me for life. No sending me money. No subscriptions to me. No paying my bills. That's not necessary here.
*   I want you to be an independent-minded thinker and trader. Once you get your model, you'll grow past these training wheels. These training wheels are given to you to protect you if you're a new student, a new trader. It's to remind you that there are real, inherent risks to these markets, especially in the times where I tell you to stay out. I'm speaking to the inexperienced trader.

## **Weekend Sentiment Analysis: A Contrarian Approach**

Going into that new week with an unknown where the opening price is going to be:

*   Between where we were on the daily chart, dropping down into the daily, the old high we were aiming for two, three, four, five weeks ago (always from back here), we got that.
*   It created a fair value gap in here, and I mentioned that.
*   I mentioned the wick in here and the consequent encroachment of that wick, which it traded to beautifully and reacted off of that.

### **The Weekend Sentiment Challenge**

Because of the weekend and not knowing where we're going to open up at, no one has that crystal ball. I don't have that, and I promise you, I know some of you are going to think that I'm trying to hold that back, but if I did know it, I'd be showing it off every single week, like I do everything else.

*   I would show you; I promise you, I would have done it, and I would say, "You know, this is it. I know this." Either I would say, "Here, I can prove I can do it on this one; I'm not going to teach it to you," or I would probably just teach it to you.
*   But I don't know. I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to do that, and I just came to the conclusion that that's just one thing I don't need to know.
*   While it would be wonderful for me to have that and be able to have a conceptual idea on how to replicate that week after week, or at least a great deal of time, more times than not, I don't have it, and I don't believe anybody ever will because of the weekend sentiment.

### **The Weekend Opinion Marketplace**

Where we close on Fridays for all markets, you have two days where everybody sits on the weekend, they read their Barons, their Investors Business Daily, their Wall Street Journal, whatever they're reading online forms, and whatnot. Everybody has an opinion, and they're trying to be the person that can say, "I told you so."

*   It's why it's important for you not to subscribe to people's opinion but using sentiment as a gauge on what you should be weighing in terms of Street money or what would be considered retail thought.
*   When I look at things like Investors Business Daily or Barons or Wall Street Journal (and I have subscriptions to those services), I like to see headlines that are very opinionated, very strong opinionated headlines.
*   I don't read the articles. I don't really care what they have to say. It's what are they trying to get everyone's attention around? Because that's going to build a sentiment idea that people that buy these services think that they're doing them a favor by telling them what markets are going to go up or where they're going to go down, what stocks to buy, what not to buy.
*   It's amazing how that herd mentality works. I go on social media, I read certain individuals that have live streams. I like reading their chat, seeing what they think collectively. In fact, I go into some of them and encourage the hosts and say, "Look, can you do a poll?"
*   If I don't get a good read, or if I show up to their chat late because I'm doing other things, I may have missed a sentiment read based on what they're chatting about.
*   I'll ask them sometimes; they don't see it, or sometimes they see it, they just ignore it. It's not a knock against any one of these individual YouTubers. It's just the fact that their chat window, their live chat, is just a wonderful resource for real retail sentiment.
*   They're like a 90% losers club, and that doesn't mean that they're stupid people; it just means that they're inexperienced but they're excited, and I'm tapping into their fevered pitch to get into the marketplace around a setting that's live around other people.
*   It's the same way when you see a bunch of guys watch their favorite football team; they get rowdy, and they're like, "Yeah!" and they can only see their team winning; they can't possibly imagine their team losing.
*   When they subscribe to an idea that they think it's going to go up or down, the ones that are on the fence, they join that team mentality, that tribe mentality, which is a weakness as a trader.
*   You don't want to have that. You want to be an apex predator. You want to be on the outside of the herd looking for that weak one, and then that's where the pack goes after and takes it down – the pack of smart money.

### **Weekend Resource Review**

On the weekend, I spend about an hour and I go through very static resources like:

*   Barons (an resource where you can get opinions like a Wall Street Journal).
*   Investors Business Daily.
*   Looking at forexfactory.com.
*   I look at General like Mainline mainstream media and I see if there's any kind of, you know, headlines like Yahoo.

These people are not mental Giants that write these articles, and that's exactly why I'm tapping into them because they're using their reach as influencers to try to inspire the Investments of the neophyte the people that just don't know. When you first start out as a Trader or an investor you think that these services are there to help you when they're not they're just opinions, so on the weekend I spend a little bit of time doing that very thing.

### **Pre-Market Opinion Formation**

What I want to get in the beginning before we get to the opening sessions on Monday morning I already draw up an opinion about what I think the market is likely to perceive the new coming week in other words the retail Traders collectively did I see a lot of ideas or opinions or hard-line people saying there's no way we're definitely going down I love the seed dogmatic sentiment sometimes it's not so dogmatic in the in the resources I tap into but whatever it is that I come to it is completely solidified when I tap into the live streamers that allow for their chat window to be open so when their little chat things go on that right there Nails it down for me like it's absolutely 90 Club you know if you fade that and your technicals are calling for something opposed to what they would be expecting now no no take what I'm saying out of context I'm not saying I don't have an idea about what I think the Market's going to do before I go into these live streamers and watch as an audience member sometimes I'm in there and they don't even know I'm there there's a few of them that I've been very public about there's a couple other ones I don't say anything about because I don't you know I've already been um I guess a a catalyst for trolling not that I inspired the trolling because I tell all my students that go there not to do that but I think it's other people they want to give our community a better update going in and they pretend that they're a supporter of our community and the things I teach and they try to be rude well I do have some of them in my in my community that are just like that they're reality of themselves but by far and large I don't try to inspire that but when we have this sentiment shift where I weeped and it's a few minutes right before the opening bell where everybody starts joining the bandwagon whatever the one person in the uh the chat window or the chat room part of the live streams when they start making their opinions known and other people yeah I think this is going to do I like that idea or yeah it's definitely going to do this it's going to do that when they start getting very dogmatic it has to be this way that's that drunken football fan mentality where they cannot see their alma mater their favorite football team their franchise you know whatever it is you know the Dolphins you know the Bears or you know here in Maryland it's the Ravens which I could get two shits about like I don't I don't watch any of it but they're wonderful studies for human psychology and what I like to do is I have a idea technically which is what I outlined last week so for the Tom Dick and Harry's that


Okay, here's the organized and refined version of the provided text, retaining all details and nuances:

# **Dollar Index Analysis: Continued Commentary and Market Sentiment**

## **Review and Clarification of Previous Statements**

To those who might reference past comments and question my current stance:

*   I encourage you to revisit my previous statements. I have consistently maintained that I anticipate further upward movement in the dollar.
*   While consolidation is possible, I believe the overall trend remains bullish.
*   The target is the low of the weekly imbalance, specifically the **107.274** level marked in pink.
*   We reached this level on Tuesday.

## **Market Sentiment and Contrarian Views**

I find it encouraging when the prevailing sentiment over the weekend suggests a potential top or expresses concerns about the dollar.

*   Currently, there's a lot of talk about the dollar collapsing.
*   I believe a collapse is possible in the long term, it can still rise during that period.
*   Many people lack a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics, failing to consider differentials, yields, and interest rates.
*   The **Federal Reserve's** interest rate hikes should, in theory, attract capital back to the dollar due to the incentive of higher yields.

### **The Dollar's Enduring Status**

Despite internal challenges, the dollar remains the dominant global reserve currency.

*   Even with the rise of the BRICS nations and a perceived "clown circus" in Washington D.C., the dollar retains a level of trust that surpasses other currencies.
*   The recent upward movement in the dollar's value is largely driven by interest rates.
*   This also inspires a risk-off sentiment, which I've discussed in previous commentaries and live streams.

### **Risk-Off Dynamics and Currency Flows**

The "risk-off" environment pressures foreign currencies due to differential-driven outflows.

*   Outflows from currencies like the pound and the Australian dollar lead to inflows into the dollar.
*   This creates a teeter-totter effect, with buying pressure on the dollar and selling pressure on foreign currencies.
*   This one-sided dynamic supports further declines in indices like the **S&P 500, NASDAQ 100**, and the **Dow Jones**, as well as individual stocks.

## **Pre-Market Analysis and Opening Price Considerations**

As a reminder, I don't possess a crystal ball to predict the opening price.

*   However, I look for specific behaviors in the market opening.
*   If the opening price were to drop to an MRI chart level, I would avoid being overly long or short.
*   I aim to remain flexible and adapt to the market's movements.

### **Revisiting Key Levels and Market Behavior**

Regarding the daily chart imbalance and fair value gap:

*   I previously discussed the separation and the midpoint of the wick on that candle.
*   The consequent encroachment and reaction from that level are significant.
*   If you missed it, go back to previous commentaries and add that to your chart! The recordings cannot be edited.
*   Here are the Fibonacci levels; feel free to take a screenshot.

### **Monday's Opening and Market Confirmation**

Monday's opening was relatively unchanged from Friday's close.

*   There was no major gap risk observed at the opening.
*   The premise from last week was that we would eventually trade up to a specific level, utilizing the information available at the discount.
*   The market isn't "done" going higher.

## **Navigating Non-Farm Payroll Week**

With non-farm payroll week approaching, it's essential to consult your economic calendar.

*   Be aware of the economic calendar every week before you start trading, and every day before you open your charts.
*   You can use Forex Factory, or any other economic calendar you prefer.

### **Trading Strategy for Non-Farm Payroll Week**

My long-held bias has been bullish on the dollar.

*   However, due to the potential for choppy conditions during non-farm payroll week, particularly between Monday and Wednesday morning, caution is advised for newer traders.
*   Ideally, setups for this week are best traded on Monday, Tuesday, and up to Wednesday's morning session.
*   By 11:00 AM New York time on Wednesday, new traders should consider closing positions.

### **Guidance for New Traders**

New traders should focus on tape reading and studying rather than demo trading or forming strong opinions.

*   Inaccuracy in predictions can lead to frustration and the false belief that the algorithm has changed or that the concepts no longer work.
*   These toxic ideas can be detrimental to your development.
*   The goal is to understand the context of my statements and avoid taking things out of context to build a false doctrine.

### **Protocol for Different Opening Scenarios**

If the dollar index had opened below the wick or tail, it would need to be immediately erased and move higher.

*   If we had gapped up and opened higher, I would look for a trade down into the high or close of the previous candle.
*   I would expect it to show some willingness to respect that level and then look for lower time frame charts to build a bullish structure.
*   This involves identifying down-closed candles supporting price, up-closed candles being broken to the upside, and stop hunts on the downside showing immediate displacement to the upside after sell-side liquidity has been taken on lower time frames.
*   Those are protocols that I teach in mentorship, which were paid services in the past.

### **The Importance of Preparedness and Realistic Expectations**

Having pre-defined procedures and protocols is crucial; you can't just "wing it."

*   Avoid relying solely on gut feelings without supporting data.
*   The uncertainty of weekend openings and the non-farm payroll week, particularly in determining the exact day of the week that the run will occur, makes it a high-probability trade.
*   After that, Thursday and Friday become more unpredictable.

### **A Realistic View for New Traders**

New traders are unlikely to successfully navigate the complexities of Thursday and Friday trading during non-farm payroll week.

*   Things can be repriced very quickly, and you may not understand why.
*   Losing real money or even pushing the wrong button in a demo account can have a significant adverse impact on your development.
*   The aim is to minimize extreme setbacks while allowing for minor mistakes that facilitate learning.
*   Avoid over-leveraging, over-trading, or expecting setups to be more frequent than they are.

### **Continuous Learning and Self-Awareness**

Remind yourself continuously that it will take time, and you must learn about yourself and how you interact with the marketplace.

*   Acknowledge that some factors will always remain unknown, such as weekend openings and the dynamics of non-farm payroll week.

## **Trading Days and Strategies**

Mondays of non-farm payroll weeks are absolutely trading days.

*   Outside of non-farm payroll, I may choose to avoid trading on Mondays unless the setup is exceptionally clear.
*   Mondays can often be accumulation days for "stupid Street money," retail logic, and harmonic trading strategies.
*   I'm not being disrespectful to those who use these approaches, but they have no bearing on price action.
*   I wait for sentiment to build up to the point where the algorithm reprices against it.
*   If it's obvious and one-sided, I'm willing to trade on a non-farm payroll Monday.
*   Otherwise, I may trade in the afternoon session when things are clearer.

### **Applying the Rules and Teaching Approach**

I've consistently stated these rules and approach.

*   As a long-term student, this may be repetitive, but I aim to be thorough for the benefit of new viewers.

## **Post-Target Analysis and Future Outlook**

Looking at the big range on Monday and the subsequent run, we reached our target on Tuesday.

*   Now, as **ICT** (Inner Circle Trader), I'm considering the rest of the week.
*   I'd like to see the mean threshold of the down-closed candle hold as support.
*   Specifically, I don't want to see a close below **106.38** on the daily chart.
*   If it trades down and touches that level or goes slightly below, it wouldn't necessarily change anything.

### **Evaluating Potential Closures**

A close below that level would indicate potential problems for making a higher high for the week.

*   This only applies to the current week, not future weeks.
*   It simply suggests that we may have already made the high of the week.
*   It doesn't mean to go short; it just means that I'm content.
*   My students and I are not in a rush to force trades, especially with Thursday and Friday still to come.

### **The Mindset of a Content Trader**

The ideal mindset is: if you've already made your money, why risk it when the risks are higher and the market makers are more active in manual intervention and manipulation?

*   You might see something that aligns with my teachings, but it could fizzle out or go the other way.
*   This doesn't mean the concepts are broken.
*   I'm teaching you comprehensively where to identify when you're likely to be wrong as the operator, especially in situations where the market is predisposed to manual intervention or manipulation.

### **Navigating Challenging Market Conditions**

In such scenarios, the chances of success are so small that it's not worth the effort.

*   Let everyone else get out there and harm themselves.
*   Let them make their own mistakes and learn the hard way.
*   Don't try to be someone's savior.

### **Developing a Mature Trading Mindset**

Let them find out on their own, and if it removes them from the industry, so be it.

*   If it teaches them a lesson and how to think about the market like I'm teaching you, they'll become far more mature traders.
*   You'll never have the fear of missing out on a move.
*   I personally never miss out on a non-farm payroll, feeling like I missed out.


Okay, here's the organized and refined version of the provided text, retaining all details and nuances:

# **Market Commentary: Non-Farm Payroll Week & Euro Analysis**

## **Addressing Weekend Frustrations & NFP Considerations**

"I wish I would have done that. I wish I would have done that. My weekend's ruined." I never feel that way. I look at it as **NFP** (Non-Farm Payroll) not for professionals, but it's **NFP** really.

*   I think I pretty much set everybody straight in regards to all that.

## **Hourly Chart Analysis: Levels & Scenarios**

Now we can drop down to the hourly chart, and here's the market trading down into that inefficiency. It trades just a little bit, yes, that's fine, and we run up into this down-closed candle here.

*   Be mindful that if we were to spike down through that daily bullish order block that I was telling you that I don't want to see it close below.
*   If it were to spike down below the midpoint of it, just have this level here highlighted because it could touch this one.

### **X-Ray View: Potential Support Levels**

Okay, so it could touch that and then resume higher. So if you want to have a very specific level below the daily chart that it's going to trade down below that mean threshold of the down-closed candle here, this one, that's that level on the hourly chart.

*   So, for, you know, an x-ray view because this level here, we had remember, I had it like this.
*   I should be charging money for this, folks. We don't want to see it trade and close below that level.
*   That's a mean threshold.
*   Okay, it can spike through.
*   How far can it go and it not really upset me?
*   This level here.

### **Identifying Order Blocks & Fair Value Gaps**

That doesn't look like it's anchored to anything, right? But when we drop down into our chart, it pops off rather clearly.

*   Here's your order block right there, and it has a fair value gap, which makes it very, very strong and likely to be a measure of potential reclaimed discount, go long smart, running accumulation, that type of thing.
*   Okay, but it's non-farm payroll.

## **Cautionary Note: NFP Trading & Study Focus**

So don't take what I just said and think, okay, I'm backing the truck up, and I'm going to get ready to take everything out of the marketplace because I see you said that.

*   No, I'm not saying that. I am not trading it.
*   Okay, you know I've said that before, and then some goober will send me something or somebody will send me a thing where they'll say ICT can't do this, can't do that, and then I go out there and make eighteen thousand dollars, twenty thousand dollars, and it's a live execution, and you have to deal with it.
*   I'm not trading it tomorrow, and I'm not trading it on Friday, so don't take this as a means for going in there and thinking this is a good setup.
*   It's something for you to study.

### **Market Manipulation & Phantom Price Action**

My concepts, just like everybody else's stuff, is prone to not work when there is a hand in the marketplace with the intended form. It's intention is to absolutely victimize the participants in the marketplace during these next two days, which is why I tell you as a new trader or a new student, don't trade it.

*   Many times, they're phantoms in price action on these two days where you could look at it and come up with all kinds of reasons why I should go up or down.

## **High Probability Trading & Market Framing**

The way I frame and I teach my students high probability is when you can frame the marketplace on a one-sidedness.

*   That means if you're bullish, if you think it's going to go higher, there's no way that you can see it or justify why it could be a short.
*   If you can in any capacity, it's not high probability long.
*   And vice versa, if you reverse it, everything that they said conversely would be the same thing for a market that's bearish.
*   If you can see things that are set up for your setups, they're bearish, and you want to go short.
*   If you can't find anything to frame it on a bullish idea, that's not high probability for a short sale.
*   If you trade in those instances only, your hit rate is going to go through the roof in terms of accuracy, but your trade frequency is going to drop precipitously.

### **Benefits of Lower Trade Frequency**

And for some of you, you think that's a bad thing; it's not.

*   You're going to save in commissions.
*   You're going to save a lot of mental capital.
*   You're going to have a life outside the charts, and you're probably going to enjoy trading more than you do right now because right now you're trying to turn it into you're an Olympic, you know, competitor where an Olympic competitor is training year round, non-stop, nutrition, training, stretching, all this stuff constantly all the time, and you're never allowing yourself to do anything else, and you're missing out on everything.
*   Like those individuals that work out in, you know, or Olympic, uh, participants, like their whole life is that.
*   You don't want that to be like I've done that with my life.
*   You don't want your life to be an entire, you know, one thing of just trading. If you're not careful, you'll do that.
*   So less frequency is a good thing, higher choice setups is the the best thing and it it's good because it controls costs that means commissions.

### **Cost Control & Avoiding Over-Trading**

Every time you try to trade more, it just increases the likelihood that you're going to get that eventual losing trade or series of losing trades, and you're inviting that instance because the more times that you want to get into the marketplace thinking that you got to get every tiny little fluctuation when you don't need it.

*   If you get the bigger runs on the four-hour chart to an hourly chart that is sufficient enough.

### **Accuracy vs. Frequency**

And everybody else out there that wants to try to trade every single day, if they're completely transparent with you, they're going to show you that their hit rate, their accuracy is far less than what you probably imagined it to me.

*   And think about the things I talk about on Twitter.
*   Think about the things I'm talking about when I do these commentaries, and I'm pulling out where I think the market's going to go.
*   I'm giving you one good idea to focus on for your analysis.

### **Leveraging Key Ideas & Developing a Trading Mindset**

When I'm tweeting and I call out specific levels, how many times am I doing it all week long?

*   It's just a few things, but those few things, if you just focused on them, they're better then you're working income.
*   You can turn those one or two little ideas per week, and they can be yielding more than your job does.
*   And I'm training you to think that way.
*   Now I can go out here and slam you with high frequency trading setups every 15 minutes just like that, and I would wear you out.
*   Some of you would be hopped up like you're on cocaine and want more of it, but that is not what you should be aspiring to do as in a developing student or trader.

## **High-Frequency Trading & Leverage**

Eventually, over time, you'll figure out if that's your, you know, your calling, if you want to be in a measure of trading like that, that's high frequency and a lot of transactions.

*   You got to do a lot less leverage though when you do that, not big trade size.
*   If you're going to do a lot of high frequency trading, you want to do it in low contract sizes because the commission costs are going to be offsetting if your hit rate is low, and you won't know that until you start trading with real money and the commissions start coming out.

### **Understanding Commissions as Taxes**

Okay, not that you should be fearful of commissions, not because they're, you know, I look at commissions as taxes, just like when you go to your job.

*   You know, how much money do you earn?
*   My salary is this.
*   I make this much a year, or I make this much per hour, whatever it is, but you really don't make that because everybody has their hand in it, and then you get what they think you should have after that.
*   So that's really what you earned, and it's significantly less than what you tell everybody else that you're making at your parties and your family functions.
*   The commissions are just like that.
*   Okay, they're like the tax man.
*   You can't escape it.
*   Okay, and the more over time you make, the more taxes they're going to take from you.
*   Okay, well, trading's just like that.
*   The more you trade, that's overtime, and that over time is going to have an offset cost associated with it in terms of commission.
*   So I don't ever look at commissions in the sense that, um, oh, this is bad.

### **Historical Perspective on Commission Costs**

When I was younger, I hated it. I was like, man, why do they keep taking all this money?

*   Well, it costs money for them to be the middleman for you to put your orders in the marketplace.
*   And I was paying a hundred dollars per contract round turn back then in the 90s, and you guys are bitching about paying a couple bucks.
*   You're getting off getting off scot-free in my opinion.

### **Volume, Leverage, and Cost Management**

But even when they're low commissions, if you do a lot and you trade a great deal of frequency, it's not unheard of for you to do thousands of dollars per month in commissions, and some of you would be afraid of that in the beginning thinking that this is unfair.

*   But if you're going to do volume and you're going to be pushing a lot of, you know, contracts to the marketplace, you're going to have that cost associated with your trading.
*   So one of the things you can do is slowly grow into that by having a great deal of concern about your trade frequency and the leverage amount that you're using in terms of the contracts you're trading, whether it be futures or, you know, the lot sizes for, uh, in your Forex.

### **Forex Trading Considerations**

Forex is a little bit different because you're you're dealing with that spread. It kind of like evaporates as long as you're on the right side, but are you really treating that accurate? You know, are you having success, you know, holding on to a trade or getting spooked out so many times, and there's little losses are doing the basically the same thing that commission costs would do in a future trader.

*   Okay, so everything's going to have a cost associated with it, and the more you want to trade frequency wise or the larger size and leverage, they invite more costs to your business.
*   So that's kind of like the reason why I teach the way I do, but also show you that over time, you know, the data is going to support the idea that as long as your skill set is there and your experience is there, um, the sky is not your limit.
*   Okay, you can make as much money as you want to make, but you can't get there overnight.

## **Euro/Dollar Analysis**

All right, let's just go back up to the daily chart and finally make our way over to euro dollar.

*   If you like everything you're hearing, you're getting a warm and fuzzy off of this, I'd appreciate giving you a thumbs up on the video or the live stream.
*   Um, there's a lot of you that watch it, but only a little bit of you actually put the thumbs up.

### **Addressing Misconceptions About Thumbs Up and YouTube Channels**

And I had a guy comment by the way before I go to the euro.

*   A guy said ICT's telling people to create additional YouTube channels so that way he can get fake thumbs up and fake views when it's the same people doing it.
*   That's not what I said, and I I know what they're saying because I didn't complete my statement or my thought at the time when I said it last week.
*   I have individuals that say it's not that I don't like your videos ICT, but I have thumbs up on videos that I really like, and there's usually like music or sports things, and I don't want to have your videos intermingled in my like list or my like history.
*   So what I was going to say last week, and this is the for completeness sake, create a YouTube channel where you're predominantly just using it for trading, and just like if you're going to be a student of mine that that's your channel, and when you have something that you hear from me that's good, number one, the currency here is for free, you know, this is just give me a thumbs up.

### **Inspiration and Value Proposition**

I don't really care. I just I like to be inspired by it because if I struck a nerve in you as a student and you feel like you're getting value from me spending my time here where I can do other things, I don't need to be doing this, um, it inspires me to do more of it.

*   But there's a video or a live stream.
*   I asked you guys if you wanted to see these types of things on a daily basis, two of them, a pre-market and a post-market review so that way I tell you where the market was going to go before it happened and how how it did that day.

### **Potential for Daily Market Reviews**

I could do that probably inside of 20 minutes on both of them.

*   Not like this.
*   This is, I mean, this is me lecturing and teaching you, but calling the market, telling you where it's going to go and then revealing it briefly what it did.
*   I can do that in two 10-minute live streams, and it would be nothing for me to do that, but the cost was that it was going to be 25,000 likes.
*   You guys couldn't get it there, so that's why it's not happening.

### **Euro on Daily Chart**

So anyway, let's go over to uh the euro dollar. All right, so here's Euro on a daily chart. All right, and we were talking about how Euro was going to be heavy and because of the dollar bullishness we were going to look for lower prices on Euro.

*   Originally, I took your eye to this here and then down here and then if we got below here and it was animated we would trade the low here and then ideally trading below that low.
*   It sounds like it's cherry-picked hindsight, but I promise you if you go back and look at the things I've talked about for Euro everything that I outlined is exactly what's in your chart right now just like we're seeing it live together.
*   I told you this fair value gap here it would likely trade up into that last week, we want to see it trade up into that and then go lower attack the the sell side below this low right there and that's exactly what you got here on your chart.

### **Market Accuracy and Transparency**

I don't own forex.com. I don't have any affiliation on any broker.

*   They're not making the trucks look like things that I say, you know, there's no manipulation here.
*   It's just literally me telling you the future using the tools and the concepts that I've been teaching for 20 almost 27 years.
*   Okay, um, not all the concepts obviously, but I've been teaching for about 27 years, 30 years in the markets and these things never get old.
*   It's just it's still a fascinating thing to see how it constantly works every single week, every single day and it won't stop.
*   You as a trader what I want you to think about when we talk about these things and how the market delivers.
*   Okay, like look at this imbalance here.

### **Imbalances and Algorithmic Reference Points**

Okay, right up here, go back and look at all the recordings back in August and July, we were talking about this very imbalance right here.

*   And the way I teach imbalances is how the algorithm itself will refer to them.
*   There are three specific levels that are Paramount but five in total.
*   Okay, so for your notes the imbalance High which would be framed by this candle's low, the imbalance low which is on this instance it's this candle is high the middle of it which is consequent encroachment because it's a gap that's the midpoint here that's this level here then it's the upper quadrant in the lower quadrant level that's always usually invisible but my eye I just look at it like I look at this one here that that's going to the upper quadrant and even though it technically didn't get to it here it just Falls a little bit short of it and it's proved me right or wrong there okay and down here I'm highlighting these two levels here and they'll pop up down here see how it felt just a little bit short of that didn't quite get down to it but in my mind that's still good okay and it's it's Reaching For That level just like it used it here okay.

### **Applying Imbalance Principles**

So in my mind if I have an imbalance if the range is sufficient enough to allow for these types of levels be to be even a factor obviously if you have a fair value Gap and it's only like say I don't know um 10 Pips or nine Pips I'm not going to look at the quadrant levels because it's in it it's too insignificant in terms of a range to be a factor I would just use the high and the low and the midpoint of it.

*   Okay, so there isn't there is an extreme um for the low end that just kind of makes it not worth considering those quadrant levels.
*   But if the range is sufficient enough or significant enough in terms of allowing for the significance of these quarter levels at the beginning.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, meticulously retaining all details and nuances while improving readability:

# **Market Dynamics: Imbalances, Liquidity, and Trading Mindset**

## **Addressing Quarters Theory & Fair Value Gaps**

I am not teaching **quarters Theory**. I don't subscribe to it. What I'm teaching is how to use a defined range between a high of a candle's low and a low of a candle's high, specifically addressing buy-side and sell-side inefficiency.

*   This is a **fair value gap**, not a liquidity void.
*   It had liquidity offered on both sides, but on the daily timeframe, it's inefficient in sell-side and imbalanced by buy-side.
*   Price went up to reprice efficiently between the candle's low and high, allowing for symmetrical market delivery.
*   The market needs to come down across those two levels (candle's low and high).
*   Once it does, it's not a balanced price range or liquidity void.
*   Out of respect, I used that terminology (liquidity void) on BabyPips because people were familiar, but I am NOT teaching **Chris Lori's** concepts.

### **Consequent Encroachment & Market Behavior**

The midpoint, or **consequent encroachment**, is key. Look at how the bodies are signifying that this midpoint is integral to what price will do and why it should behave that way. We were bearish on Euro because we've been bullish on the dollar.

### **Disclaiming Support/Resistance & Supply/Demand Trading**

When the market goes back to these inefficiencies, understand I'm not a support/resistance trader. I'm also not a supply/demand trader.

*   These are elementary concepts to introduce the idea of price action to someone new, but not specifically *why* they react.
*   **Supply and demand zones** are vague.
*   Not every zone is salient to what the market will be referring to in its underlying narrative on a given timeframe.

### **Comparative Chart Analysis & Institutional Perspective**

Consider how many zones you see on my charts. I'm pointing out the ones that work because I'm telling you what's been codified and showing you what's being shown in price.

*   I'm directing your attention to what matters, linking it around the weekly and daily charts.
*   This gives you the **smart money perspective**: the higher timeframe where all the institutions and the *real* order flow reside.
*   Forget level 2 crap.

### **Liquidity, Inefficiencies & Market Dynamics**

You're supposed to be focusing on these things, but you're not because they're not in books. You're looking for patterns for pattern's sake, but that's not what trading is.

*   You're looking for **liquidity** and **inefficiencies**.
*   Anything outside of that is consolidation or manipulation where you'll get hurt if you're in the marketplace.

## **Liberating Trading: Releasing Retail Theology**

Doesn't that free you up? Isn't it liberating? You don't need to know what price pattern price is going to respect right now, or what theory or logic or retail theology you're going to institute as your trading mechanism for the day. I've said this many times over the years.

*   I'm trolling, to be honest.
*   I want these individuals to come to my content and try to disprove it.
*   Everyone that's ever tried, I've converted.
*   It's like a sticky web.

### **Analogy of the Spider & the Web**

I'm luring you in like a spider. Come on in here, buzz by me close enough. Once you start seeing what it is I'm doing here, you will stay here.

*   I promise I won't consume you.
*   I want you to hang out.
*   I want you to be successful.
*   You can use my web and eat from my table for free.
*   I don't need to fleece you or take anything from you.

### **Confidence & Market Mastery**

I can take as much as I want from these markets. I can do it any day I want, anytime I want, in any market I want.

*   Once you get that confidence, it will seem inconsistent or bitter to someone that can't do it or is trying to sell something nobody wants.
*   It sounds like arrogance, conceited narcissism, or a narcissistic perspective, but it's **unrivaled confidence**.

### **Disciplined Trading & Overcoming Fear**

That's exactly what you would expect to achieve if you figured out that the markets are not random at all.

*   I'm trying to teach you how to not fear the market.
*   You need to fear your inability to be disciplined.
*   You need to fear derailing yourself by being impulsive, fearful that you're going to miss a move.
*   The fear of missing out is your infancy as a trader, and it's normal.
*   I'm trying to remind you that my systems work on all timeframes and there's not a short supply of opportunities.

### **Versatility Across Timeframes**

I literally can sit down with you in the seconds charts and show you how to make what you make in a month in one trading session, using a 30-second or 15-second chart, and be done in 15 minutes.

*   There's nothing holding you back with what I'm teaching you, but I have to allow for your personality to come through.
*   If I try to force you to trade with a 15-second model, some of you just aren't going to be able to do that.
*   It's going to feel too fast when it's not fast at all.
*   The pace at which the market's trading higher and lower is the same.

### **Pattern Recognition vs. Key Observations**

We're looking at a daily chart here for Euro right now, and you're seeing it trade at 1.0502 and 6 pipettes. Now it just went up three pipettes. If we're looking at this on a five-second chart, it didn't move any faster than it just did here on the daily chart.

*   You're looking at the candlesticks to look for patterns.
*   Your mind is telling you to look for head and shoulders, bull flags, bear flags, triangles, wedges, trend line breakouts, and harmonic patterns.
*   You're looking at the red herring, the sleight of hand.
*   You're falling victim to the distraction.

### **Transparency & Market Predictions**

I'm trying to train you to observe the things that matter most. I don't put the lipstick on the chart after it does it to look smart. I tell you right then and there what it's going to do, and then it does it.

*   That's not fraud or faking it.
*   We're on a daily chart.
*   Am I bending time and space now?
*   Am I changing your charts and manipulating the Chicago Mercantile Exchange?
*   Am I controlling price out there?

### **Embracing Learning & Profitability**

At some point, you're going to have to submit and realize that this is really what goes on and stop resisting. Just learn.

*   You don't have to tell anybody you learned it.
*   Just start making money.
*   That's all I want you to do.
*   Start making money and live better.
*   I want you to have a better life.
*   I want you to do well.
*   I want you to be successful.
*   You don't have to give me a high five.
*   You don't ever have to reach out to me.

### **Free Resources & Personal Expectations**

There is no obligation on your part. I promise you, if you look at the things I'm teaching you, that I'm making available for free, that I could literally be making millions of dollars a month all over again. I don't need to do it.

*   It's shocking to see how many people literally kick a gift horse in the mouth.
*   I'm trying to do everything I can to show you that you can do this, and it's not complicated at all.
*   It's absolutely something that you can do.
*   Don't be so overbearing on what you place on yourself as an expectation.

### **Unfiltered Commentary & Precision Examples**

Think about this turning into a Twitter space. I've been cooped up in this RV, and I've been wanting to chit-chat, so it's coming out right now because we're live and I'm unfiltered. I'm not saying too many bad words tonight.

*   We traded up into this level here, which was given to you beforehand.
*   Look what it does here. Look real close.
*   This candle's low right here comes in at 1.0615.
*   Even the high on this candle trades up into 1.0617 and two pipettes.
*   That's two Pips and two pipettes.
*   That is very, very small in terms of variance between what you would expect is reasonably trading into the Fairway Gap.
*   If it was perfect, it would stop right at that 1.0615, but it only went two point, what was it, two point 2 Pips.
*   That's a freaking spread for some brokers.
*   We're only talking about the spread; that's the difference.

### **Foreign Exchange Market & Turning Point Precision**

We're talking about the world's largest market, the Foreign Exchange Market. You're telling me that you're not impressed with being able to determine the turning points to this degree of precision, allowing for the dealing spreads of the majority of Brokers to be the only variance in the high of that candle, and then it delivered where I said it was going to go, which was over here.

*   If we get below this low, it will sweep that low right there.
*   Went below that low over here.
*   They routed up to here.
*   Go back and listen to the commentaries.
*   Right off that level, boom.
*   That trade from here to here.

### **Multi-Timeframe Analysis & Liquidity**

You need to start spreading out all your lower timeframe setups on a 15-minute, hourly, five-minute, and one-minute timeframe. Look at the seconds chart if you have the opportunity to do so.

*   You'll see all kinds of opportunities there that most of the time go right over your head.
*   Look at how many opportunities form on the daily chart.
*   They're not happening every single day.
*   We're using this narrative that this timeframe is allowing for prolonged moves.

### **Directional Trading & Risk Mitigation**

When you get these turning points or where I'm calling specific levels, they're going to be impactful for a price that they should be responding to once it trades them.

*   Then you want to start dropping into lower timeframes and trading in New York session or the London session, looking for price to trade into the direction of this level here, this level here, and this level here.
*   That's how you use the draw on liquidity.

### **Avoiding Premature Assumptions**

That's not to say that you can't be a buyer and scalp Longs running out liquidity or trading into an inefficiency above price, but don't marry those trades thinking that's created the low or fight thinking that I'm gonna pick the low of your dog.

*   I told you not to do that.
*   I've lost lots of accounts doing that as a young man.
*   I've tried many times to pick Bottoms in bearish markets, and I tried foolishly to try to pick tops in Bull markets.
*   I can pick the bottoms in Bull markets, and I can pick the tops in Bear markets.

### **Precision Across Timeframes**

These were all given to you beforehand and it's on the daily chart. My Precision is not limited to one-minute charts, 30-second charts, five-second charts, or one-second charts.

*   They're not limited to the lower timeframes because price is price.
*   If I took the time delimiter off of the chart, saying, "Okay, it's not a daily chart," and I just said, "Here, look at this price action," and I said no reference to time, I could teach you the same way.

### **Top-Down Analysis & Market Speed**

You're coming to me from a school of thought of a retail Trader, and you're looking at typical classic top-down analysis. There's nothing wrong with that per se because to some degree everybody's doing some measure of top-down analysis.

*   You view the monthly as a very slow timeframe. Really? Is it slow?
*   Trade with 15 contracts in your trading combine tomorrow on the monthly chart, you're going to see how slow it is.
*   It's going to be moving the same thing in terms of pace that it's going to be doing on a one-minute chart.
*   If you've watched it on a one-minute chart, you're like, "It's this neck-breaking speed, I can't do this. I can't trade 15 contracts on a lower timeframe."

### **Perspective & Preconceived Notions**

It's all relative. It's relative to the perspective that you hold going into it because you have a preconceived idea and notion that these markets are faster on the lower timeframes when they are no faster than they are on any other timeframe.

*   It's just giving you a plethora of setups.
*   That's why there's a benefit to me teaching with a lower Point frame.
*   It also reminds you that everything should be, you know, hanging on the success or failure of these one setups that you're looking for because there's always new setups.
*   Always new setups.

## **The Greatest Skill Sets: Overcoming Losses & Iterative Improvement**

One of the greatest skill sets that I've discovered as a Trader was, if I was trading on an hourly chart, one of the first models I had was trading the bond market, and I would use the stochastic. I'm not saying that you should be using stocastics because obviously I don't do this now, but in the beginning, I would only look for going Longs, and I wanted to see the daily stochastic be oversold.

*   I wanted it to cross over, and then the day after the crossover, up, like it was oversold and having a bullish stochastics crossover while it's oversold.
*   As soon as the K and D would cross those signal lines, once that happened, I wanted one day where the next day I want to see it does it still open up and keep trying to come out of that oversold condition.

### **Trade Mitigation & Lower Timeframe Advantage**

If I got that, then what I wanted to do was look for the 60 Minute oversold condition, so I would want a daily chart to give me a stochastic, they were so bullish stochastics crossover while oversold, and then two days after the crossover after that, then I'm going to look for an hourly oversold. Well, that framework many times didn't work for me and I would have a losing trade.

*   Years later, and I'm talking 10 years later, I discovered the power of using one-minute charts and five-minute charts.
*   That one trade that I would take a losing trade on, I could get that back in one hour using a one or a five-minute chart, and that's how I started using it.

### **Evolving Trading Strategies**

It wasn't like I wanted to use the lower timeframes to build big positions in pyramid like you see me doing today. That wasn't how I used it.

*   I used the lower timeframes to mitigate losing trades that were on my model of choice.
*   Sometimes that model wouldn't be effective, and I would be a, I would lose.
*   Then I would drop down to lower timeframes, and I would take a chunk out of that losing trade a couple times in the same day to get it back.
*   Once I got it back, then go back to trading my model on the daily chart again.

### **Adaptive Trading Mindset**

Then I got to start thinking, I was like, "You know, why am I not just trading like this? Like, why why am I doing this? Like, I I'm Marrying an idea."


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, meticulously retaining all details and nuances while improving readability:

# **Evolving Trading Strategies, Avoiding Common Pitfalls, and Market Analysis**

## **Transitioning to Lower Timeframes & Overcoming Initial Challenges**

I'm doing, which is why I tell you don't do that, and all of a sudden, I went from trading on a one-in-five-minute chart with a bond market with one contract to trading with two contracts, five contracts, ten contracts, and up. So it was a gradual learning curve for me to discover that the books weren't successful in my hands. Everything I bought and tried to use wasn't helpful to me; all it did was create more puzzles for me to waste time trying to figure out.

*   So I threw it all away – not literally, because I have a library that's very extensive and large.
*   I won't throw the books away because they have sentimental value to me, even though they're absolutely worthless, and I would, you know, get no value from them.
*   The time that I spent with them, and the hopes that I hung on them, and the authors that wrote them, I had a lot of faith in that these books, every time I would buy them, they would be helpful to me, and they never lived up to the hype that I placed on them.
*   That's why I tell you, don't buy books.

### **Transparency and Avoiding Misinterpretation**

I'm telling you, don't buy *my* books, okay? Don't do it. There you go. I'm not trying to take anything from you. I'm writing books so that way, the things that I've authored, I've codified these things, okay? I've coded these things, okay? When I tell you they're about to happen, I know they're going to happen. That's why I've said it, okay? But I don't want that credit being borrowed or stolen by other people like they have done over the last seven years. They have lied, they have lied and said that it's something else that they can justify while they're doing it and selling it under the pretense it's something else.

### **Disclaiming Other Methodologies**

Nothing I do is wiped off. Nothing that I do to supply and demand. Nothing that I do is **Chris Lori's** stuff. Nothing that I do is **Larry Williams**, except for Commitment of Traders. Except for his puzzle of wishing he knew when to buy below the opening price when he would always be a buyer of strength. I figured out how to buy under the opening price. I figured out how to sell short above the opening price, and when to do it, exactly when to do it, when *not* to do it.

### **The Power of Knowing When *Not* to Trade**

A lot of the things that make me stronger than most everybody else in terms of analysts is I have procedures and protocols that tell me *when not to do something* when everybody else out there is trying to. That makes me and what I do superior to everything else in and of itself. By itself, it completely puts me in a position that's so upper tier, and that's not bragging because everybody else is out there trying to do something to prove to their subscribers, prove to their patrons, prove to their students that they can take the next day's trade when I'm telling you sometimes it's better for you to *not do anything*, just sit still and be content with that. That's maturity. That's wisdom.

*   Some of you don't understand the value in that.
*   Some of you, if you just would have been more inclined to be patient and sit still instead of trying to do something else because you made a lot of money today or yesterday or last week, you want to go do it again when I'm trying to teach for my son when he does well: *sit still, enjoy it, know what it feels like to have that under your belt. You won. You did what you were supposed to do.*

### **Avoiding Addiction to the Next Trade**

But if your child, if you're constantly chasing the next setup, and I've had students that paid me that every single day I sat with them and did what I've done here for, you know, you know, a year and a half now with all you calling things in advance on Twitter or making analysis videos on YouTube for free, publicly in the market walking out like a script and doing these, I thought I said I was going to do 90% of the time plus, but not all the time.

*   As soon as it happens, and very least some of these individuals, and you see them sometimes make themselves available in the comments section of the videos that are made, you know, open to comments and then, or replying to me on Twitter, and they'll say, "Okay, what now? What's it going to do?"
*   They're addicted to the next thing, and they're never going to understand what it feels like to be content as an analyst that has an independent mindset that picks and chooses their own setups and doesn't lean on anybody else to be a catalyst or driver for it.

### **The Goal: Independence and Outgrowing Mentorship**

I want you to be able to be independent from me at some point. I want you to never have to come back to my YouTube channel and watch anything. You don't hear that from content creators. They want you to keep coming back. I want you to outgrow me. I want you to get to the point where it was great learning this. I had fun doing it. It was a wonderful experience, but thank you, ICT. I no longer need you. I'm on a momentum journey, and I've got whatever I'm going to get from you, and I appreciate it, and I'm on my way now. That's exactly what I want. I want that for all of you. I don't want this tethering.

### **Personal Reasons for Pausing Content Creation**

That's why I'm stopping. I'm stopping for a reason that's personal because I want to get my home prepared because things are about to get stupid and crazy, and the World's Gonna Go upside down, and things are going to get harder even for rich people. It's gonna get harder, so that's why I'm giving you this skill set so that way you can have another stream of income to help make your ends meet. If you get rich with it, God bless you with it, but if you can make your bills, you know, in any capacity easier by having this information, I'm going to be much more blessed because of it, and I didn't ask you anything for it. You didn't have to pay me for it. You get to test drive it for free, and you watch me walk it out here for free, calling it beforehand, trading it, real money executions, live broker. There's no excuse now.

## **Market Analysis: Pound Dollar and E-Mini S&P**

But Pound Dollar, um, well, look at that real quick as a reminder. Like I said last week, I'm not trying to call the top in the dollar. I don't think we're done.

*   The Fed actually said they're going to be actually raising interest rates into next year, too, so we're we're just now in October.
*   If they're telling you they're going to raise interest rates going into next year, does that sound like there's any reason for the dollar to stop going up? No.

### **Geopolitical Considerations & the Dollar**

What happens if we have an event that takes place that's kinetic between our country and other countries? What do you think the dollar is going to do? It's going to go parabolic straight up. So you need to try to avoid trying to pick the top in the dollar Index, okay? If that happens, the work continues in its upward direction in terms of the dollar. That means down here, like I mentioned last week, that this is where I believe ultimately we'll go to for the pound.

### **Pound Dollar Analysis & Consequent Encroachment**

Last week, I told you watch this candlesticks tail in the midpoint of it, which is consequent encroachment to the midpoint of it because we treat Wicks and Tails as a gap, and you can see it trades right there on Friday, trades right up into it, goes a little bit past that. That's permissible, that means we accept it. We are not scared if it does that. The market does what trades lower overtakes the imbalance here, which let me go back up to a weekly chart because that's what it's anchored on.

*   That's this candle's High right here on March 2023.
*   March 6th rally, and then this candle is low, March 20th, the week of and on of this year, 2023.
*   So that one single candle up here, that's a fair value Gap in the form of a buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency.
*   That's what's being highlighted here.

### **Inversion Fair Value Gap**

So when we have that on the weekly chart, let me drop down the lower time frame daily, that was the draw, and now this should act as an inversion fair value cup. That's how I would like to use the information that it's given me. So trading above it a little bit today, that's fine, but I want to see does it want to go lower and then use the low of it or consequent course midpoint of it if the dollar continues to go higher.

### **Internal Dialogue & Risk Assessment**

Now, for the folks that are playing armchair quarterback, and they want to look for something to complain about or say you didn't say this, you said that, I'm giving you the internal dialogue. I'm telling you what I want to see happen, how I would use the information, but I'm also telling you what I would not find favorable in the analysis, in other words, what would keep me from taking real risk.

*   If someone were willing to sit down with you and tell you how they think about trading, and they're successful, and they can prove and they have done it for years in front of a legion of witnesses like I have, you would want them to be very forward with the details.
*   Can you teach it a little bit more detail? That's how I teach.

I go around it the long way because I want you to understand. I want you to have every subtle nuance because it's not far on payroll Friday. My willingness to let that trade go if it were to set up and go lower this week, it's fine as long as it doesn't trade below this low here. Next week, I would start looking for shorts to get to that room, to that low, and I would miss any move that starts on Thursday or Friday, not from payroll, and I'm willing to let that go.

### **Confidence in Diverse Setups & Profitability**

How can you do that, ICT? What happens if it's a big move? I've been in big moves that are not non-farm payroll. I've been in moves that most people don't know when they're coming because I'm not short on supply of new setups that work real well. That's the confidence that you get learning how to read price like this. The Market's still going to do these things, but because you're brand new and you're afraid it's going to stop working, or you you'll just be a lottery winner where if you can just get lucky once in a while and get a payout or get a profit here or there, okay, that's all you're looking for right now because in your mind you don't believe you can be profitable. Let's be real honest with one another, okay?

*   If we were together talking, and we met, I would ask you, "Do you really believe in your heart that you can be profitable?"
*   I would expect you to be honestly. I don't think so. I would like to be, but I don't think I'm going to be, but I'd love to have the opportunity to be proven wrong.
*   That's what I would expect if someone was being honest with me, but some of you aren't willing to admit that, and that's why you take these gambles, and you do these prop firm challenges, and you do more account challenges than you should because you know what you're doing is all chance and luck, blind luck because you're gambling.

### **Edge, Model and Experience**

You have no Edge. You have no model. You have no experience to lean on. You have new data to support the idea of what it is you're trying to do as a ballot even approach at all, so that's why you are afraid of missing a move because you think that that move is going to be the only one of its kind. It's a unicorn. You'll never find another one like that ever in existence when it's silly to think that way, and but I understand how it is because I felt that way when I first started to, and it's important to understand that not while that is unfortunate, it's normal, and you need to look past it, okay?

*   So if it does move a lot on Thursday or Friday, I don't care because my stuff will work next week.
*   It'll work next week after that.
*   It'll work even on Christmas week.

### **E-Mini S&P Analysis and Targets**

And I'm going to quickly get through the rest of this because my battery is about to die, and I don't want to plug it in because it'll make it even longer than it already had. So here's the daily chart for e-mini S&P. I told you we would reach for this low down here, which is also part of this inefficiency. We dug down into that, and that Target's been met as well.

*   So everything has been 100% strike rate in terms of what we're looking for going into this week.
*   We've done it so far with all the markets.
*   I'm not trying to call the low on your uh on the e-mini S&P like I said I wasn't trying to pick the low on Euro or pound dollar, and I'm not trying to pick the top one dollar.
*   Should everything remain the same and remain everything equal, then I would expect price to want to gravitate down to this low here, and eventually, if we were to accelerate, say something happens kinetically between countries as we get into the holiday season, we could see it trading below these lows here, and yes, that's a significant move, but that's not a lot in terms of what would be expected if there's something kinetic breaking out between different nations and ours, okay?

So, uh, worst-case scenario down here before New Year's, okay?

### **Unicorn Setup**

60-minute chart, this is the opening gap for the week where we closed on Friday, where we opened this week. We went lower, came back up in the lower quadrant to that level, broke lower, sell-side imbalance by-side inefficiency with a breaker. That right there is a unicorn setup, folks. That is one of the wonderful setups that this repeat over and over and over again. It's there every single week, multiple times, on many different time frames, but this setup alone is a model in and of itself. It's beautiful. What would you aim for that low right there, and it hits it right there, beautiful. That's it. You're done. Wrap it up. Go do something else with your time. I got to jump to NASDAQ because I know if I don't, the battery will die.

## **NASDAQ Analysis and Reluctance to Move Lower**

But ICT, this is not professional. You should be doing longer videos. You should have made preparation. You should be thankful. All right, so we had Market trade down into the inefficiency and Below these lows as I mentioned this one's here, uh this one here rather in relationship in contrast to the E-mini S&P, NASDAQ's being a little bit more reluctant to go lower, okay?

### **Trading Strategy and Risk Management Considerations**

So I mentioned this last week, it's it's a high resistance type thing getting through these consolidations, and sometimes you have to let it come back against you a little bit, and it's even worse when it's a non-fromp hero week, it's it's it's very very hard to do that, okay? And again, it's another reason why I'm not trying to hold overnight or for the weekly range like I'm usually in Forex for a long time, I've taught you and I showed examples of where I'm one shot one kill around multiple days trading the weekly range. I'm not trying to trade that model because of the risk that's in the marketplace today, and it's been like that for a while since 2020.

### **Intraday Trading**

So I I'm content with being an intraday Trader getting in, getting out, and being comfortable with that. I don't know if it's going to change anytime soon, so to answer the question about that, I don't know what time frame it's going to change to bring me back to being one shot one kill and holding for longer longer term moves. All right, so last week, I said we would trade up into this area here, but I want to see the upper portion stay open.

### **Weekly Chart Analysis**

We got that. We collapsed here on Tuesday and Wednesday. We dropped again below the lows here, came back a little bit more than I would like to personally have seen for NASDAQ. I would like to see it lose a little bit more ground there on the 60 Minute chart. I don't want to take these annotations off because I want my son to see them, and he hasn't had a chance to see it yet. I have to work around it. I apologize.

### **Equilibrium and Opening Gap**

Nothing in here except for the equilibrium of this range between the high and the low midpoint of that right in here, see that, and then they have the gap of this week where we closed on Friday, where we opened up. We basically traded back up into that Gap. Two things there: the opening gap of the week and then the equilibrium price point between this low and that high. I want to see it get heavy in here and start.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the provided text, meticulously retaining all details and nuances while improving readability:

# **Evolving Trading Strategies, Avoiding Common Pitfalls, and Market Analysis (Continued)**

## **NASDAQ Analysis (Continued) and Potential Rotation**

That's what I'd like to see, but because it's not non-farm payroll week, if it doesn't do so, it's been skin off my back. I couldn't care less, and I'm not going to risk any money or lose or hope to profit anything. So it liberates me as an analyst not to expect or be right about anything.

*   Watch this high here.

We could punch that tonight and then maybe work its way down into this area here post non-farm payroll Friday, okay?

*   So there you go.

Run this high, run this high, or consequent encroachment of that wick, but definitely take this high here and then maybe reject that and then come back down in here come non-farm payroll Friday morning to 11 o'clock in the morning in that area time-wise and then a five minute chart.

*   The inefficiency right in here with the order block, which is down into that dug into it and rallied up.

All these details here, I gave this markup and took the live trade on **NASDAQ,** called the level out 14864. Even which was two ticks below the actual level, which is the old high I showed on the recording.

*   If you watch on Twitter to this very candle high.

All these notes here on a one minute chart still aren't lined up. I told you it's about to die. I want a 30 second chart. I traded all this in here, and it came back on my stop, and then I went right back in again, and it ran right to my objective.

### **Twitter Execution Videos and Future Content Location**

So if you want to watch that, it's on Twitter. I can't put music on my videos anymore because the asshats over there on Twitter are taking them down because I put music in them, and I give full credit to the authors, and I'm not monetized on Twitter, so it's kind of lame.

*   If you like those execution videos with the music, you might want to download them and save them because they're eventually probably going to scrub all of them, which is interesting because it's kind of like I'd never put those ton of trades out.

I keep all that stuff. It's logged and then we on my YouTube channel and I'm not taking not my YouTube channel, it'll be on my website. So good luck doing anything with that because they'll be up here forever.

## **Concluding Remarks: Market Recap and Caution**

And I think that's going to be it for tonight. I've done a lot of jawboning. I coached. I talked about what the market has done and rewinded you where we thought it was going to do in terms of direction targets levels. It's perfect. It was perfect, absolutely perfect.

*   Just be careful tomorrow non-farm payroll Friday week on Thursday and Fridays are problematic.

And until talk to you sometime probably on Twitter. I don't know if it'll be tomorrow if it'll be in the afternoon, but I'm sure I'll be tickling your Twitter there. I'll probably call something out on non-prof payroll live on Twitter, but not to inspire you to take a live trade until I talk to you then though be safe.

    *   **Dollar Influence:** If the Dollar declines sharply into a previously outlined daily inefficiency, the Euro could rally.
    *   **Buy Stop Target:** A rally could target and wipe out an area of trail buy stops on short positions.

## Enhanced Analysis: Balanced Price Ranges, Fair Value Gaps, and Intermarket Dynamics

### Balanced Price Ranges and Price Action
*   **Balanced Price Range Behavior:** When price returns to a balanced price range, it will act accordingly.
    *   **Ideal Scenario:** The preference is for price to only retrace to the halfway point of the range.
    *   **Acceptable Limit:** While price could reach the highest point of the range, failure to do so indicates important information.
    *   **Confirmation of Weakness:** If price moves below the range, then only retraces to the midpoint (or just below), before moving lower again, this signifies that the balanced price range is preventing price from reaching its high.
    *   **Explanation:** This isn't necessary because the market already offered sell-side liquidity.
*   **Real-World Trading Insight:**
    *   **Avoidance of "Nitty-Gritty":** While viewers may desire simple buy/sell signals, understanding the underlying principles is crucial for consistent profitability.
    *   **Candlestick Selection:** Why is a specific candle being used, and why are other options being rejected?
    *   **Range Expectations:** Why is it expected that a range will remain unfilled, while another is expected to be filled?
    *   **Learning Investment:** This level of understanding requires more than a short video to properly explain.
*   **Fair Value Gap Interaction:**
    *   **Scenario Consideration:** If a candle *didn't* trade down into the upper portion of a fair value gap...
    *   **Inversion Fair Value Gap:** ...then the subsequent pass-through (where the fair value gap is expected to fail as support) would allow the inversion fair value gap to extend all the way to its high.
    *   **Reasoning:** The initial drop into the upper portion already offered a degree of sell-side liquidity.
    *   **Key Area:** The low of that candle, which is highlighted, is what is important.
    *   **Critical Condition:** If price trades down below it, I don't want to see it trade back up in between these two levels once we get below this shaded area.
*   **Spread Considerations:**
    *   **Market Awareness:** Markets factor in spread, especially in Forex.
    *   **Broker Control:** Brokers can widen spreads at will, regardless of advertised rates.
    *   **Limit Order Exception:** Limit orders provide certainty, but market orders are subject to spread variations.
    *   **Spread Monitoring:** Traders rarely monitor the actual spread they pay, driven by FOMO.
*   **Defining the Range**
    *   **Key Levels:** The difference between this candle's low and the high of the fair value gap are critical
    *   **Restricted Movement:** If price trades down below the shaded area, it shouldn't trade back up in between the key levels.
    *   **Consequent Action** Because the effects of this candle trading down to the upper portion of this fair value Gap it's already offered on the basis of this move here
    *   **Sensitivity Expectation:** After trading below, if price returns to touch the low or halfway point, it should be sensitive and not trade higher.
*   **Mohawk Allowance:**
    *   **Permissible Deviation:** A small "Mohawk" (slight deviation above/below a level) is permissible.
    *   **Mohawk Definition:** A little tiny deviation above or below a level.
    *   **Rejection of Upper Portion:** A Mohawk can touch the line but should not touch the upper portion
    *   **Bearish Signal:** If price does trade above the upper portion, it indicates extreme weakness.
    *   **Intermarket Implication:** The dollar is expected to accelerate higher.
    *   **NASDAQ Implication:** Any shorts seen in NASDAQ should be high probability and should see an aggressive sell-off towards sell-side liquidity.
*   **Inefficient Market:**
    *   **Alternative Scenario:** If the candle hadn't traded down into the upper portion of the fair value gap...
    *   **Buy-Side Only:**... it would mean the range had only buy-side liquidity.
    *   **Missing Sell-Side:** The range would be inefficient in sell-side delivery because it's buy side imbalance.
    *   **Implication:** The market has to eventually reprice lower.
*   **Fair Value Gap Evaluation:**
    *   **Treatment Analysis:** It's crucial to analyze how a fair value gap was treated and utilized.
    *   **Consequent Encroachment:** Focus on whether it traded down to the consequent encroachment and if it respected that.
    *   **Upper Portion Focus:** That action creates a gap by this candle's high and that candle's low.
    *   **Rejection of Top-Side:** If price trades back down below it, I don't want to see it come back up and touch the top.
    *   **Short Opportunity:** If not the case, it should be considered a short above the consequent encroachment of the fair value gap.
*   **Mohawk as Entry:**
    *   **Partial/Pyramid Entries:** Many times, the speaker has added partial or pyramid entries outside the fair value gap due to the Mohawk expectation.
    *   **Anticipation:** Knowing the expected Mohawk means not fearing it and knowing it's likely to occur.
    *   **Superior Entry:** A fill on a Mohawk is a superior entry and part of the game when trying to get fills.
    *   **Success Rate:** It's not always successful due to market flux.
*   **Inversion Fair Value Gap Explanation:**
    *   **Detailed Insight:** The video provides detailed insights on the use of inversion fair value gaps.
    *   **Real-World Application:** This is demonstrated with examples in long-winded videos.
    *   **Text vs. Visualization:** While text explanations can be unclear, the video outlines and refers to examples, providing clarity.
    *   **Predictive Accuracy:** Viewers have witnessed the speaker call inversion fair value gaps correctly before they were respected by the market.
    *   **Logic-Based:** This isn't based on make-believe or hindsight, but ongoing logic that tends to repeat more often than it fails.
    *   **Edge and Model:** This creates an edge, a model with statistics and probabilities.
    *   **High Probability:** Determining market predisposition (higher or lower) leads to high probability trades.
*   **Responsible Trading:**
    *   **Mindset:** If you can't apply this mindset to every trade, you're gambling.
    *   **Outcome Ownership:** If successful, it's due to skill; if unsuccessful, avoid blaming external factors.
    *   **Personal Responsibility:** Revert back to personal responsibility - the market and gaps don't force trades; you make the decision.

### Shifting to 60-Minute Chart Analysis
*   **Cy Breaker Pattern:**
    *   **Sell-Side Focus:** We traded up into both of those and that's a nice that is a very, very strong model when you're looking for sell side, everything reverses.
    *   **Buy-Side Reversal:** Can be used to reverse for buy side.
    *   **Inefficiency:** It broke lower and then traded up into the inefficiency.
*   **Sunday Trading Caution:**
    *   **Burned Many Times:** The speaker has been burned many times on Sundays with similar scenarios.
    *   **Setup Example:** The market trades up into a level, and if the market opened up inside the fair value gap, a short would be taken on Sunday expecting lower movement in the Monday London session.
    *   **Erratic Behavior:** However, sometimes the market would go higher, taking out buy-side liquidity treated as stops, preventing profitability.
    *   **Reason for Discontinuation:** The speaker stopped trading on Sundays due to this behavior.
    *   **Ongoing Events:** It's not just a market quirk but a sign of potential wartime events, terrorist events, and their uncertainty.
*   **Gap Opening Expectation**
    *   **Gap Close Expectation:** These events could promote fear and lead to a gap opening lower, followed by a repricing to close the gap between Friday's close and Sunday's opening.
    *   **Post Gap Close Movement:** The market should then trade below the gap and not offer support; it should fail.
    *   **Inversion Fair Value Gap Confirmation:** A move that trades up into the area and then does not close beyond the opening price means we can treat this like an inversion fair value gap and look for a short
*   **Alternative Bullish Scenario:**
    *   **Long Opportunity:** If it trades down to the Gap and treats it as support, the analyst won't be long (not trading Forex).
    *   **Inversion Fair Value Gap in Reverse:** Instead, it should be viewed as an inversion fair value gap.
    *   **Unseen Moves:** Moves will occur that were not anticipated.
    *   **Acceptance:** Acknowledge that fact and move on without beating yourself up for missed profit opportunities.
    *   **Mental Drawdown Avoidance:** Prevent the mental drawdown from money that was never risked.
    *   **Pre-Market Planning:** Pre-market expectations and running scenarios help make comfortable decisions.
    *   **Impulse Avoidance:** It helps free up permission to give yourself, so that way you don't feel impulsive and chase price.
    *   **FOMO Rejection:** Rejection of getting it wrong and of missing out, which could cause you to punish yourself.
*   **Trading Responsibly:**
    *   **Ownership:** Take responsibility for your trades; if you make money, it's your achievement; if you lose, own it.

### S&P Analysis (Brief Overview)
*   **Weekly Chart & Quarterly Shift:**
    *   **Rally Expectation:** The market rallied up and the analyst expected it to trade up into these levels.
    *   **Bear Scenario:** Outlined a bear scenario looking for a quarterly shift (every 3-4 months).
    *   **Market Structure Shift:** There's a shift in market structure where the market can move sustained moves for two to three months.
    *   **Quarterly Overlap:** It is not running on a perfect three-month calendar.

*   **Higher Timeframe Levels:**
    *   **Notepad:** The analyst has levels written on a notepad.
    *   **Significance:** The monthly, weekly, 4-hour levels are significant draws on liquidity.
    *   **Trade Consideration:** If there's going to be a draw to a very low level that one felt of importance that we could reach here on a longer term basis any trades that I would be taking that's short.
    *   **Max Risk Level:** If we get within 20 to 30 handles, you would likely be at your maximum risk which is 5%.
    *   **Reduced Risk Level:** If you are taking trades that would be moving away from these levels, you are not going to trade with 5%.
*   **Trading with higher timeframe levels**
    *   **Benefit:** Having all these higher time frame levels is to know when you're going to push the envelope of your risk if it's more likely to pan out and go into these higher time frame levels then I'm confident that my intraday trade executions are very, very tight they're very specific they're very extremely precise I know what I'm looking for I know when they're going to likely form and if I can frame them on the basis of moving into the direction and it starts getting real close to these higher time frame levels then I'm going to go with my maximum risk which is 5%.
*   **Aggressive MT4 Strategy:**
    *   **5% Risk per Entry:** In the past, during MT4 account runs, 5% risk was used per entry.
    *   **Pyramiding Impact:** New partial or pyramid entries also used 5% risk, leading to trades with up to 20% impact on the account.
    *   **High Pip Rewards:** The math works because when you're running it and you're getting hundreds of Pips it parlays it up fast.
    *   **No Deception:** It's not a rented MT4 server, it's not Photoshop.

*   **Recent Price Action:** Following a move into an old low, the market traded upward into a **Cy Breaker**.
*   **Preference:** Ideally, the analyst prefers that the price *does not* revisit recent highs.
*   **Target Range:** The desire is for the market to remain in the lower portion of a specific price wick.
*   **Key Level:** If any rally occurs this week, the analyst wants to see it stay *below* the **4391 level.**
*   **Tolerance for Fluctuation:** Expectation of slight movement around the 4391 level.
*   **Critical Threshold:** A *daily close* above **4391** is undesirable, as it would likely necessitate another run at the high and potential movement into the area where the volume imbalance resides.
*   **Positive Observation:** The market's failure to reach the volume imbalance suggests significant resistance ("it's heavy").
*   **Key Factors:**
    *   The inability to close in the entire **Cy Breaker** (large down-closed candle).
    *   Failure to return to the volume imbalance.
*   **Premium Indication:** These factors indicate a premium within the range from the high to the low.
*   **Volume Imbalance Location:** The volume imbalance is located where the analyst's chart would show the "sell-side imbalance by inefficiency low," marked by the high of that area (shaded on the chart).
*   **Consequent Encroachment:** There wasn't a consequent encroachment of the **Cy Breaker.**
*   **Implication:** This is viewed positively.

### Addressing Potential Upside Movement

*   **Wick Consideration:** Because of the existing wick, the analyst *doesn't* want to see price trade above its halfway point.
*   **Retracement Limit:** Any retracement should be contained within this range.
*   **Specific Boundary:** Upside movement should be limited *inside* the specified range, with a maximum of **4391.**
*   **Intra-Range Freedom:** Price can move freely within this range.
*   **Closing Basis Requirement:** Crucially, the price shouldn't close above the specified level on the *daily chart*.
*   **Trading Stance:** As long as this condition is met, the analyst will remain bearish on ES and bullish on the dollar.

### Intermarket Relationships and Geopolitical Context

*   **Integrated Analysis:** The analyst integrates multiple markets like puzzle pieces.
*   **Disclaimer:** This approach *doesn't* guarantee accuracy, but it demonstrates the teaching methodology, usage of PD arrays, and application of intermarket relationships.
*   **Wartime and Geopolitical Impact:**
    *   The current geopolitical and wartime events create significant difficulty due to unpredictability in reactions and potential local impacts.
    *   These events increase market fear and volatility.
*   **Year-End Amplification:** In the final quarter of the year, any price animation will be exaggerated, leading to larger moves.
*   **Target Dynamics:** Targets are likely to be easily met and even surpassed, exceeding levels that traditional methodologies can pinpoint.
*   **Manual Intervention:** This behavior indicates the utilization of fear and potential manual intervention.
*   **Acceptable Risk:** It is possible to take trades, and be accepting of the risk involved around them, weighing out the risks while still allowing for the best case scenario, where we get the best of the best
*   **Optimal Exit Strategy:** In these conditions, aim to take off 80% of your trade before the "perfect exit," but leave a portion to potentially exceed the best-case scenario.
*   **Mentorship Insight:** This type of trading is not commonly found in books and is difficult to articulate outside of specific environments.

### Trading Psychology and Market Awareness

*   **Value of Mentorship:** Trading is about watching things and understanding the logic.
*   **Impactful Insights:** Seemingly verbose explanations can be highly impactful for experienced traders.
*   **Preparedness:** The analyst is rarely surprised by market events. This *doesn't* equate to being right all the time, but rather being prepared.
*   **Climate-Specific Characteristics:** The current climate tends to manifest specific characteristics.
*   **Normal Conditions Contrast:** Without wartime events and terrorism risks, expectations would differ.
*   **Normal Exit Strategy:** Best-case scenario targets would be approached with 80% of the position closed, and the remainder exited slightly below the ultimate target.
*   **Focus on Exits:**
    *   The analyst's weaknesses lie in exits, aiming for perfection.
    *   Entries are deemed phenomenal in comparison.
*   **Multiple Timeframes:** Multiple timeframes are often used to determine targets.
*   **Distraction Awareness:** Distractions (teaching, personal interactions) can impact trading decisions.
*   **Real Money Trading:** Decisions are heavier when trading with real money.
*   **Concentration Break:**
    *   If concentration is broken, the analyst *must* close the trade.
    *   Broken concentration can lead to the analyst's "bipolarism" and "rage" taking over, a pattern that negatively impacted the analyst in earlier years.
*   **Imperfect but Profitable:** Acceptance of being imperfect but profitable is essential.
*   **Low-Hanging Fruit Objective:** The analyst teaches a "low-hanging fruit" objective that is refined over *years*, not just months.
*   **Student Innovation:** The analyst expresses confidence that students will develop amazing, uniform exit strategies.
*   **Openness to Improvement:** The analyst would openly adopt a successful strategy developed by a student.
*   **Target Imperfections:** The analyst acknowledges wrestling with imperfections in target selection.

### ES Analysis Continued: Daily Chart and Fair Value Gaps

*   **Reiteration:** The market shouldn't trade above the specified level on a closing basis.
*   **Inefficiencies Absence:** There are no inefficiencies in the current run.
*   **Impacting Move:** The market has crossed over something that may be impactful going forward.

### "Double's Advocate" Scenario: Gap Down and Fair Value Gap Interaction

*   **Scenario:** Consider a gap down at the opening, followed by a trade back up.
*   **Ideal Outcome:** The trade should reach *only* the low, *not* the top.
*   **Midpoint Permissibility:** Trading to the midpoint of the fair value gap is permissible.
*   **Bullish Expectation:** In a bullish scenario, the fair value gap would be expected to offer support and propel price higher.
*   **Bearish Expectation:** In a bearish scenario, the fair value gap would be expected to fail.
*   **ICT Criticism:** This scenario addresses critics who claim ICT's methods fail, attributing failure to improper application. The analyst then explains how they use the same method successfully.
*   **Fair Value Gap Failure:** A failing fair value gap provides valuable insight.

### Bearish Gap Scenario: Oversold Conditions and Retracement

*   **Scenario Setup:** If there's a gap lower than the low of the previous candle (Friday's low), the market is technically oversold.
*   **Repricing Expectation:** Expect repricing against the opening price.
*   **Retail Trader Behavior:** Many traders will chase the move lower, believing it's a breakout.
*   **Entry Point:** Retail traders will enter short as the market opens and trades lower.
*   **Reversal and Fair Value Gap Test:** The market then runs back up and tests the low of the fair value gap.
*   **Desired Action:** The analyst wants to see this occur and then the market roll over and move lower, aiming for the day's low.
*   **Weekly Target:** The market may then gravitate towards the sell-side liquidity resting below this area throughout the week, although it may not happen immediately.
*   **Premium Array:** This area is treated as a premium array, with the expectation that the market *doesn't* need to trade to the higher end of it.

### Practical Application and Risk Management

*   **Short Entry Mechanism:** This scenario can be used as a mechanism to get short.
*   **Stop Loss Placement:** Stop losses can be limited to just above the consequent encroachment.
*   **Buffer Zone:** A buffer of at least three to four handles above the consequent encroachment is recommended due to the allowance for "little Mohawks" (slight deviations).
*   **Lower Timeframe Considerations:** Tighter stop losses (e.g., 1.5 handles) are possible on lower timeframes (15-second, 30-second, 1-minute charts).
*   **Current Climate Caution:** However, tighter stops are *not* recommended in the current volatile climate.
*   **Risk of Stop-Out:** Using excessively tight stops increases the risk of being stopped out prematurely.
*   **Experience Factor:** The analyst has the experience to re-enter trades after being stopped out, but acknowledges that most traders may not have this ability.
*   **Analyst's Experience:** The speaker admits to being stopped out trading with live, real money 3-4 times this year, and going right back in to get the desired outcome.
*   **Book vs. Live Teaching:** These concepts are difficult to convey through a static chart in a book.
*   **Fair Value Gap Failure Nuance:** It's not simply about a fair value gap failing; there's more to it.
*   **Order Flow Teaching:** There are many times the analyst wants PD arrays to fail.
*   **Institutional Order Flow:** Real institutional order flow isn't related to Level 2 data, DOM, volume profile, or other "gimmicks."
*   **Algorithmic Buying:** Every down-closed candle supports price as it rises because algorithmic buying is taking place within that candle.
*   **Handshake Analogy:** The algorithm has already extended the opportunity, so it is not going to need to go back down in there because the algorithm has already extended the opportunity for the algorithms that use this in a marriage, like a handshake between the delivery mechanism.
*   **Enigma Concept:** The analyst's "Enigma" concept (a conceptual idea of how to handshake with the market's algorithm) dovetails perfectly with these concepts, leading to precise analysis and confidence.


## In-Depth Analysis of Market Dynamics, Order Flow, and Trading Psychology

### Introduction
The analyst discusses observations on Twitter, noting the repetition of certain market behaviors over years. The focus shifts to understanding order flow, specifically analyzing how down-closed candles interact with price in both bullish and bearish scenarios.

### Understanding Institutional Order Flow

*   **Predictive Analysis:** Sharing market predictions on Twitter allows observation of their unfolding on personal charts over extended periods (years).
*   **Mentorship Experience:** Private mentorship students have observed these patterns for years, daily.
*   **Comfort Level:** Familiarity with recurring patterns grows over time.
*   **Down-Closed Candles:** When bullish, down-closed candles should *support* price, acting as bullish order blocks.
*   **Up-Closed Candles:** Conversely, when bearish, up-closed candles should act as bearish order blocks.
*   **Downside Delivery:** As price moves lower, each up-closed candle should facilitate downside delivery.
*   **Ease of Movement:** Real institutional order flow is evident when price moves *easily* through these candles.
*   **Market Transparency:** Key price points (highs and lows) are universally visible on the NASDAQ futures contract (December 2023 delivery).
*   **Elimination of Discrepancies:** This eliminates discrepancies found in Forex markets with varying spreads.
*   **Futures Market Preference:** Commodity and Futures markets are preferred due to their precision and refined nature compared to Forex, where "Tom, Dick, and Harry spreads" exist.
*   **Career Specialization:** Traders can specialize in individual futures markets for consistent results with minimal time commitment (e.g., one hour per day).
*   **Focus on Direction:** The primary focus is determining whether the market is bullish or bearish and identifying target areas.
*   **Short Work Life:** Consistent profits can be achieved with a short daily trading session.

### PD Arrays and Institutional Order Flow in Action

*   **Example of Institutional Order Flow:** The analyst explains the use of institutional order flow as an example of market dynamics.
*   **Bullish Scenario:** When bullish, each down-closed candle should support price, repelling it upwards upon contact and propelling it higher.
*   **Potential Reversal:** A potential reversal may occur upon reaching a range extreme or buy-side liquidity.
*   **Bearish Scenario (2022 Short Entry):** After a run on buy-side liquidity and a break in market structure, the expectation is that down-closed candles that previously supported upward price movement should be easily broken through.
*   **Narrative Importance:** Understanding the underlying narrative is crucial in determining the role of an order block as a catalyst for entry or a target.

### Inverse Nature of PD Arrays and Trading Psychology

*   **Failure as Insight:** Every PD array contains the potential for failure, providing valuable insight for counter-trade ideas.
*   **Inverse Relationship:** PD arrays have an inverse nature.
*   **Light Bulb Moment:** Experienced students realize they can capitalize on the failure of PD arrays (e.g., Breakers, Mitigation Blocks) by trading the inversion.
*   **Loss Acceptance:** There's no reason to fear losing trades, as they are inevitable.
*   **Skill Development:** Developing the ability to identify specific entry points and appropriate risk levels takes time and experience.
*   **Motivation vs. Impulse:** The analyst references a Twitter discussion about the transition from disciplined motivation to reckless impulse.
*   **Model Abandonment:** Avoid abandoning a trading model due to excitement or second-guessing, leading to impulsive and reckless trades.
*   **Repeating Dynamics:** Recognize that price action patterns repeat constantly.
*   **PD Array Failure Strategy:** When a PD array fails, some students actively anticipate and trade based on that failure.
*   **Model Adaptation:** Models are not broken, but adapted to fit expectations based on price action.
*   **Flexibility in Approach:** Models provide flexibility in determining an entry, even if the initial assessment is incorrect.
*   **Fair Value Gap Example:** A fair value gap can be used for entry, but if incorrect, it indicates being "offside" and potentially signals an opportunity for resistance.
*   **Partial Targets:** The analyst mentions a daily low that would serve as a target.
*   **Opening Considerations:** The opening and consequent encroachment of a wick as potential areas of resistance or support.
*   **Dynamic Factors:** Acknowledging a lack of easy "one-two-three" recipes in trading.
*   **Personalization is Key:** Trading success cannot be consistently uniform in terms of risk, profit, or partial targets.
*   **Perfection Fallacy:** Perfection is not necessary for profitable trading.
*   **Contentment with Enough:** Emphasizing contentment with "enough" profit.
*   **Profit Mindset:** The goal is to consistently close the trading day in profit, regardless of the amount.
*   **Break-Even Goal:** The initial goal is to maintain the starting equity balance.
*   **Self-Discovery:** Trading with real money reveals personal trading tendencies and limitations.
*   **Model Suitability:** Real money exposes if trading with a given model, timeframe, and risk measure are sustainable for your risk tolerance.
*   **Stop Loss Graduation:** One might need to trade with larger stop losses if precision isn't there yet.
*   **Smaller Stop-Loss Risk:** Smaller stop losses demand precision and increase the risk of being stopped out.
*   **Larger Stop-Loss Perspective:** A 15-handle stop loss can be large when trading with multiple contracts, but manageable with micro lots.
*   **Self-Management:** Managing emotions, holding trades, and avoiding premature break-even moves are crucial skills.
*   **Practical Learning:** These skills are best learned through experience and rule adherence, not solely from books.
*   **Micro Lot Recommendation:** Starting with micro lots ($5 per handle for E-mini S&P, $2 per handle for NASDAQ) allows for learning with manageable risk.
*   **Funded Account Caution:** Funded accounts can be problematic if traders revert to high-risk strategies.
*   **Emotional Impact:** Fluctuations in larger sums of money can trigger fear and impulsive decisions.
*   **Personal Anecdote:** The analyst shares an anecdote about their son's experience with funded accounts, highlighting the pitfalls of impulsive trading with excessive risk.
*   **Stop Loss Strategy:** Keeping the stop loss just above the consequent encroachment.

### Specific Scenario and Market Outlook

*   **Overlap Scenario:** The market has overlapped the fair value gap, moving from the highest point (consequent encroachment) to the low and closing below it.
*   **Bearish Expectation:** If the market opens below the low and trades back up, it's expected to act as resistance, especially if it remains below the consequent encroachment.
*   **Importance of Rules:** Even with randomness, adherence to outlined rules and factors can lead to potential profit.
*   **Hindsight Consideration:** Acknowledging that the discussion before the market open on Sunday contains the most uncertainty and value.

### Content Segmentation and Value

*   **Content Segmentation:** The information shared would typically be exclusive to charter-level students.
*   **Preventing Misuse:** Measures are in place to prevent unauthorized distribution and sale of proprietary content.

### Market Structure Analysis and Trading Implications

*   **Post Gap Drop:** There was a drop down outside of the gap, closing in the portion of the last buy-side inefficiency.
*   **Gap Underneath:** There's a gap right underneath that area.
*   **Inefficiency Repricing:** The inefficiency has now been repriced with the move to the current level.
*   **Defined Gap Range:** The gap extends from the low of one candle to the high of another.
*   **Past Misconceptions:** There was a time when the analyst was using buying moving average crossovers
*   **Inefficiency and Liquidity:** Inefficiency exists below the current price, and sell-side liquidity rests below the low, indicating a potential draw if the market moves lower.
*   **Retracement Opportunity:** If the market moves lower and then comes back up to this area, without trading into the fair value gap, there may be a repricing opportunity.


## In-Depth Analysis of Fair Value Gaps and Trading Scenarios

### Potential Trade Setup: Daily Inversion Fair Value Gap

*   The analyst is looking at a potential trade setup based on the **daily inversion fair value gap.**
*   The target range for this setup extends from the level of the gap to as much as the **midpoint (consequent encroachment)**.
*   The analyst will be watching for the price to trade down into the fair value gap.
*   This potential trade setup is being considered for the **E-mini S&P (ES) futures contract.**
*   If the opportunity presents itself and the analyst is available to trade, they will record the trade with a **live account** to demonstrate the scenario.
*   A **real stop-loss** will be used, reflecting a risk-managed approach. The analyst emphasizes they aren't trying to display perfection, but rather to select specific, high-probability setups.
*   The analyst states that when they point out or refer to something on Twitter, it's because they have already reached a conclusion that it has high merit and is worth mentioning.

### Market Predictions and Probability

*   The analyst feels confident in their market predictions, stating there are very few instances where their Twitter analyses do not pan out.
*   However, the analyst also states that opportunities don't happen every day, and trading is not an everyday activity.
*   The analyst acknowledges the initial excitement and desire of new traders to find opportunities daily, but emphasizes this is unrealistic.
*   Experienced traders with a deep understanding of price action, their model, and themselves, can potentially achieve daily profits. They might even recover from intraday losses to end the day profitable.
*   A new trader should not expect to achieve that level of consistency within their first year.
*   Unrealistic expectations can lead to disappointment, impulsive behavior, and deviations from the trading model.

### Trading Psychology: Avoiding Gambler's Numbness

*   Feeling like a failure can trigger impulsive and reckless trades as a form of self-punishment, which is framed as "punishing the market."
*   Subconsciously, this behavior can stem from a desire to lose, ending the cycle of uncontrolled trading.
*   This aligns with the concept of **"gambler's numbness,"** where the individual bets with the intention of losing everything to force an end to their uncontrolled behavior.
*   A mature trader would recognize losses, cut them, and return later with a sound mind.
*   However, many casino gamblers lack this discipline and continue until they reach "gambler's numbness," where they become indifferent to loss and subconsciously seek it as a means to stop.
*   If you find yourself pushing buttons for the sake of pushing buttons, you need to immediately exit the trade.
*   Taking a week off from trading, charts, and related content is necessary to "ground yourself."

### Consistent Profitability vs. Gambling

*   Failing to recognize and address undisciplined behavior will lead to repeated mistakes.
*   Even experienced traders can fall into this trap, achieving occasional profits but lacking consistent profitability.
*   They might gamble with their one chance to succeed, over-leveraging trades without stop-losses to impress others.
*   Trading should focus on specific entry points, controlled risk, and a reasonable profit objective based on a well-defined narrative.
*   The rationale behind the trade should be substantive and rooted in institutional logic (liquidity runs or rebalancing to an old inefficiency), not flawed retail logic.
*   Price movements are caused by either running for liquidity or rebalancing and repricing to an old inefficiency. Manual intervention is the only other possible factor.
*   Manual intervention is difficult to time, although it can be anticipated around calendar events, economic news, and Fed announcements.
*   Surprising manual intervention can occur, leading to exaggerated price moves and unforeseen risks, particularly in Forex markets.

### Review of Prior Analysis and Current Market Structure

*   The analyst reminds listeners of the practicalities of trading and the ever-looming possibility of unexpected risk.
*   The market traded up, made a high, broke low, and had a shift in market structure before coming back up to a bearish order block.
*   The market then rotated lower, taking out sell-side liquidity.
*   The analyst references previous analyses on their YouTube channel, encouraging viewers to verify the timestamped predictions.
*   There was a gap, and the market traded up into the consequent encroachment of a wick before being rejected.

### Key Levels and Objectives for the Week

*   The market exhibited effects of repricing to the fair value gap.
*   The market then bumped the buy side above a short-term high, and subsequently offered sell-side delivery.
*   Going forward, if equities move lower, the analyst will be using specific levels for the week:
    *   **Consequent encroachment of the tail of a candle.**
    *   The analyst would like to see a daily close below a key level to gain confidence in a run towards relative equal lows.
*   Specific downside levels of interest:
    *   **Consequent encroachment or midpoint of a particular range (14,431.75).**
    *   **The low of a specific candle, representing an old fair value gap on the weekly chart, acts as a draw on liquidity.**
    *   **Midpoint of a specific candlestick's wick (14777).**
*   Upside levels to consider:
    *   The analyst is less concerned about the high of last week.
    *   Focus will be reframed on the sell-side imbalance buy-side inefficiency.
    *   **15,356.75 (high of the sell-side imbalance buy-side inefficiency)**
    *   **15,288.75 (consequent encroachment of the inefficiency)**
    *   **15,006.75 (low of the inefficiency)**
*   The analyst prefers price to stay in the lower portion of this inefficiency and not revisit the upper region.

### Bearish Scenario and Key Resistance Level

*   Worst-case scenario: Price trades up to this week's consequent encroachment (approximately the upper quadrant of the inefficiency).
*   **15,288.75** is a critical level. A daily close above this level would sideline the analyst.
*   As long as the price remains below that level and below the consequent encroachment of the inefficiency, the analyst expects weakness.
*   Downside targets for profit-taking or partial exits:
    *   **The level near 14431.75**
    *   **The old buy-side inefficiency (low of a specific candle).**
    *   **Relative equal lows in very close proximity (around 86 even and 89 even).**
    *   A break below these lows is expected to extend down to consequent encroachment and potentially reprice to the low at 14,244.5.
*   These are the impactful levels the analyst anticipates for the week.

### Daily Chart Analysis

*   The market worked up into a fair value gap and cleared buy-side liquidity.
*   The analyst referenced this area in previous discussions last week.
*   The market behaved in a manner consistent with seeking discount, selling off, and forming a small fair value gap.
*   This gap is considered a potential inversion fair value gap.
*   If the market gaps lower and trades back up to this area, the analyst would like to see it trade to the high of the fair value gap, allowing for a complete retracement (Mohawk) if necessary.
*   The analyst will then watch for resistance and a potential trade down below the low of that candle.
*   The Analyst will look for it to reach down into the cell side below.

### Partial Exit Strategies and Risk Management

*   Prior to reaching those levels, a partial exit strategy for bearish learners would be the consequent encroachment of the wick.
*   The analyst highlights the importance of understanding balanced price ranges and the effort required to break through them unless there are strong driving forces.
*   These considerations are crucial for developing realistic expectations and managing risk effectively.


Okay, here is the organized and detailed version of the provided text, formatted for improved readability and clarity, while maintaining all original information and nuances.

## Advanced Trading Strategies and Market Analysis: A Deep Dive

### Partial Exit Strategies and High Resistance Liquidity Runs

*   It's crucial to identify strategic points for **partial exits** aligned with market structure.
*   Potential partial exit points:
    *   Below the recent low.
    *   The **consequent encroachment** of a specific wick.
    *   Consider a scenario where price retraces slightly below the low, fails to break lower, then rallies back to the **consequent encroachment**.
    *   Ultimately, anticipate sell-side liquidity being taken out at a later time.
*   Trading **high resistance liquidity runs** (trading through consolidations) requires the ability to identify reasonable partial exit points.
*   The analyst reveals insights into their personal trading approach.
*   **Partial exits** are typically taken when trading within a **high resistance liquidity run.**
*   In contrast, **low resistance liquidity run** setups usually involve **full pulls**, meaning the entire position is held to the target without scaling out.
    *   The analyst sets a target and allows the trade to run its course.
*   While **high resistance liquidity runs** are still likely to be successful, the analyst acknowledges uncertainty about whether targets will be met within a specific session.
    *   This necessitates a more active management approach, including identifying strategic partial exit points.
*   The importance of aligning trading with personal schedules and commitments is highlighted.
    *   The analyst alludes to time constraints due to family obligations and the need to schedule trading activities accordingly.
    *   The analyst humorously references a potential situation with his wife due to the length of the analysis.

### Understanding Balanced Price Ranges

*   Recognizing the significance of **balanced price ranges** in market analysis is crucial.
*   A **balanced price range** is characterized by oscillating price action (sell-side, buy-side, sell-side, buy-side) resulting in consolidation.
*   Breaking through a **balanced price range** requires significant momentum and is unlikely to occur in a single move.
*   A strategy for trading balanced price ranges:
    *   Divide the range into logical segments.
    *   Target the midpoint of a wick as an initial partial exit point if bearish.
    *   Consider the low of a candle or the consequent encroachment of a wick as further targets.
    *   The market may attempt a "fake-out" by trading to a level, failing to reach a lower target, and then retracing to the consequent encroachment of a wick before eventually moving lower.
    *   The analyst makes allowances for these scenarios when trading against **high resistance liquidity runs.**

### Contrasting High and Low Resistance Liquidity Runs

*   **Low resistance liquidity runs** are traded without partial exits.
*   The entire trade is staked on the initial entry, with the stop-loss managed to remove risk.
*   Once the risk is removed, the trade is allowed to run based on strong conviction in the analysis.
*   The analyst believes that the probability of the trade reaching the target is high enough to warrant holding the entire position.
*   The analyst's analysis suggests a retracement may occur. If the analysis is incorrect, then the retracement may be deeper than what the analyst is willing to accept. Because of this possibility, he removes the risk with a stop-loss and is willing to accept the outcome of his analysis.
*   Personal time constraints (family obligations, scheduled activities) limit the ability to actively manage trades.

### Sunday Opening Gap and Inversion Fair Value Gaps

*   The analyst considers potential scenarios based on the Sunday opening gap.
*   If the market gaps lower, a potential trade setup involves:
    *   A rally back up to the gap.
    *   A potential move all the way to the top of the **fair value gap**.
*   This is due to the fact that the market has only had one pass through since the formation of the **fair value gap**.
*   The analyst emphasizes the importance of rule-based trading when using **inversion fair value gaps**.
*   The rule-based approach is specific and not overly complex.
*   The analyst provides clarity on when to expect **inversion fair value gaps** to remain open, when to anticipate them being completely filled, and when a halfway retracement is the most likely scenario.
*   The analyst assures the audience that the information being shared is available at no cost.
*   Humorously notes that one might expect that someone who's rich wouldn't try to tell people to buy his book.

### NASDAQ Analysis: Buy-Side Imbalance and Sell-Side Inefficiency

*   The analyst shifts focus to NASDAQ, highlighting a **buy-side imbalance** that remains.
*   The imbalance originates from a specific price range (from one price to another).
*   The market action is similar to the ES analysis.
*   Because there was price delivery down, the remaining portion of inefficiency for sell-side exists within a specific candle range (low to high).
*   The lack of sell-side delivery indicates potential for further downward movement.
*   Below the low of that candle lies sell-side liquidity.
*   The market could draw down into two potential PD arrays (Premium Discount arrays) that are discount in nature.
*   The analyst anticipates this scenario at some point.
*   The analyst outlines an ideal scenario:
    *   An **inversion fair value gap** forms.
    *   A trade entry is triggered.
    *   The trade reaches down to the targeted areas.
*   However, the analyst acknowledges that the opening price will influence the trading decision.
*   If the market opens relatively unchanged, the analyst may not be as eager to short the **inversion fair value gap.**
*   Instead, the analyst may prefer to see the market:
    *   Trade to the gap.
    *   Start to move lower.
    *   Create an inbound **fair value gap** on a lower timeframe.
    *   Trade into that fair value gap.
    *   Use the identified areas as the draw for the trade.

### Trading Plan and Risk Disclaimer

*   The analyst emphasizes that this is not just one plan, but multiple scenarios.
*   The analyst outlines two scenarios in which he would feel confident selling short NASDAQ with a live account and making money.
*   The analyst reiterates the importance of individual responsibility in trading and provides a clear disclaimer.
*   This is not a trade signal or an invitation to follow the analyst's trades.
*   It is not intended for use in prop firms or demo accounts.
*   The purpose is to share the analyst's thought process and how they are using current market structure.
*   The analyst strongly urges viewers to be 100% responsible with the information and avoid twisting or contorting it.
*   He wants to ensure that no one takes actions they were not instructed to take and subsequently blame the analyst for any negative outcomes.
*   The analyst is simply sharing their perspective on the chart and how they intend to use the information.

### Closing Remarks and Audience Engagement

*   The analyst believes the analysis has been comprehensive.
*   The analyst references previous coverage of gold after the dollar index, indicating a prior segment.
*   The analyst expresses appreciation for audience engagement and requests a "thumbs up" if the content was helpful.
*   Acknowledges that "thumbs up" doesn't equate to additional ad revenue, but is a measure of the audience's appreciation.
*   It motivates the analyst to continue creating content.
*   The analyst states that they would still create content even if they didn't receive a lot of "thumbs up", but that it is still a good encouragement to do so.
*   The analyst wishes the audience a pleasant remainder of Sunday.
*   The analyst anticipates engaging with the audience on Twitter soon.
*   The analyst closes with "be safe."

### **Market Analysis and Commentary (October 29, 2023)**

#### **Introduction**

Good evening, folks. Hope you're all doing very well. In this session, we will be discussing market analysis, focusing on the Dollar Index, Euro/USD, and NASDAQ, referencing specific chart patterns and potential trading scenarios. I will try to make this quick, as I am wanting to be with you live with the opening in about 24 minutes.

#### **Dollar Index Analysis**

*   **Initial Observations:** Last weekend, specifically on Sunday before the market opened, I stated that I wouldn't consider a trade unless the daily chart showed a move with a close above the upper quadrant of a specific wick. This did not occur from Monday through Thursday.

*   **Key Levels:**
    *   **Consequent Encroachment:** **105.818**. This level represents the consequent encroachment of a candlestick's tail or wick. If weakness is observed, this area would be a key level to watch for support.

*   **Bias:** Despite global uncertainties, I'm still leaning towards a higher Dollar Index but am ready to be proven wrong.

*   **Daily Chart Insights:**
    *   A fair value gap (specifically, a buy-side imbalance, sell-side inefficiency or **BISI**) was highlighted in the previous live stream. I mentioned that we could draw down into that level, and this doesn't negate a long dollar bias.
    *   Reviewing the past week's price action (Monday-Friday), price spent considerable time within this gap.

*   **Four-Hour Chart Observations:** We spent most of the time respecting halfway, or consequent encroachment, of that blue shaded area.

*   **Sunday Trading Considerations:** Sunday trading is unpredictable. We must wait for the new week's opening price to determine market direction, considering the London and New York sessions on Monday.

*   **Hourly Chart Analysis:**
    *   The week was largely range-bound.
    *   A noteworthy observation is the **SMT (Smart Money Technique) Divergence**.
        *   The dollar made a higher high while the Euro/USD failed to make a lower low. This divergence acted as a catalyst for a slight upward move in Euro/USD.
        *   Later, while the dollar took out sell-side liquidity, Euro/USD did not close below the shaded area.

*   **Desired Market Conditions:** I want to see a gap lower opening on NASDAQ, E-Mini S&P, and Dow futures. Conversely, I would prefer to see the dollar gap higher, potentially filling the gap before rallying further. This would support the idea of not trying to pick a top on the dollar, and also confirm what I've been outlined on Friday when I was in my trade. However, I don't want to carry anything over the weekend because of Gap risk.

*   **Geopolitical Considerations:** All eyes are on the Middle East. The uncertainty is being factored into market sentiment, which is currently unfavorable for risk. If indices such as NASDAQ rally this week, it's likely to be short-lived and met with more shorting.

*   **Dollar Index Consolidation Impact:** Dollar consolidation can lead to exaggerated moves in exotic pairs (those not dollar-based), driven by interest rate differentials. In such conditions, focus should shift from major dollar pairs to these exotic crosses, identifying stronger vs. weaker currencies for potential trades.

#### **Euro/USD Analysis**

*   **Weekly Chart:**
    *   **Inside Week:** Last week was an inside week. An inside week or inside candle typically signals a large move shortly, generally within the next two candles. In this case, I would expect the beginning of a large weekly range when the weekly market opens.

*   **Inside Candle/Range Dynamics:**
    *   An inside range has a lower high than the previous range and a higher low than the previous range, signaling compression.
    *   Large ranges expected to follow. If this doesn't happen within two time frames, it implies longer consolidation and not to anticipate a large range move.

*   **Trading Strategy:** If we're expecting a large range move on the weekly, that would be great for the series of, you know, the daily chart creating one-sidedness predominantly over the course of the week. If it doesn't give it to me, then I go right into scalping and I'm not looking for like a one shot one kill scenario.

*   **Daily Chart:** Range-bound. Euro/USD found some support in a specific candle from Wednesday and Thursday.

*   **Bias:** I'm not terribly bullish on Euro/USD. I'd prefer to see a gap lower opening, followed by a trade-up to fill it, and then further weakness. If this occurs, it would support further weakness going into Monday. If we gap higher and trade down, I'd look for a move in the first half of the week to trade up into a specific area. However, I would still favor shorts until proven otherwise.

*   **Risk Management:** Nothing is risked by observing and analyzing market expectations. This allows for risk-free information gathering. Once a high-probability setup is identified, then a trade can be considered.

*   **Four-Hour Chart:** The market is not symmetrical.

*   **Market Conditions:** Price swings aren't obvious and trade-able. These conditions are best avoided by new traders due to their complexity and potential for losses.


### **Market Analysis and Commentary (October 29, 2023) - Detailed Breakdown**

#### **Euro/USD (Pound Dollar/Cable) Analysis**

*   **Initial Considerations:** I wasn't interested in taking any positions last week unless specific conditions were met, which didn't happen.

*   **60-Minute Chart Observations:**
    *   The price action is considered "ugly."
    *   There are unresolved gaps and sell-side liquidity pools:
        *   **Sell-side liquidity:** Present below the current price.
        *   **Inefficiency:** Exists lower down.
    *   **Buy-side Liquidity:** Buy-side liquidity has been taken (ran) multiple times.

*   **Preferred Trading Scenario (Euro/USD):** I'd like to see:
    *   A gap lower opening.
    *   A subsequent fill of the gap.
    *   Then, a move to target sell-side liquidity.

*   **Weekly Chart (Euro/USD/Pound Dollar):**
    *   Not particularly excited about the weekly chart.
    *   **Longer-Term Perspective:** I'd like to see it trade lower.
    *   **Sell-Side Target:** Sell-side liquidity resides lower.
    *   **Inefficiency & Order Block:** An inefficiency exists alongside an order block.
    *   **Dollar Index Correlation:** If the Dollar Index continues upwards, I expect this scenario to play out.

*   **Sell Balance Buy Inefficiency:**
    *   Located at the low of one candle and the high of another (single down-closed candle).
    *   Price traded up into the consequent encroachment of this area two weeks ago.
    *   There was not an inside range, but a lower low compared to the previous week.
    *   Support was found in the described area.

*   **Inversion Fair Value Gap:** I'd like to see the price break below the support area, then treat it as resistance to move lower towards weekly objectives. Refer to last Sunday's live stream (2023 mentorship commentary) for more details.

*   **Daily Time Frame (Pound Dollar):**
    *   The inefficiency has been tested multiple times.
    *   Expectation is for the price to move lower and then use the previous support as resistance for further downward movement.

*   **Four-Hour Chart (Pound Dollar/Cable):**
    *   Sell-side liquidity has been taken.
    *   Bodies of candles are respecting a fair value gap.
    *   The price action is "really ugly".

*   **Trading Recommendation:** I would avoid trading Cable unless a significant downside move occurs.

*   **Euro vs. Cable Preference:**
    *   If the Dollar Index resumes its upward trend this week, I'd favor trading Euro over Cable.
    *   This preference might change at the week's opening if different signals appear.
    *   Currently, Cable appears too "sloppy" for inexperienced traders.

#### **Index Futures Analysis (NASDAQ, E-Mini S&P, Dow)**

*   **CME Gap (Cly Shift) Target:** Previously discussed target from months ago.

*   **Market Behavior:**
    *   Breakdown occurred after trading higher.
    *   Last week saw a significant sell-off.
    *   Relative equal lows exist with sell-side liquidity below.

*   **Consequent Encroachment:**
    *   The midpoint of the range is at **14431 and 3/4**.
    *   Desire to see price trade down to that level.
    *   Initial focus on breaking below relative equal lows.

*   **Sell-Side Stops:** Expect sell stops (liquidity) below these lows.

*   **Resumption of Downward Movement:**
    *   Downside movement resumed from a sell-side imbalance, buy-side inefficiency between candle's low and high.
    *   Price traded up into this area and was rejected.

*   **Upper Quadrant Shortfall:**
    *   Overshot the consequent encroachment on the wick but fell short of the upper quadrant.
    *   Price moved to the mean consequent encroachment of the wick's inefficiency.

*   **Desired Opening Scenario:** Gap lower than the close, rushing below the lows to accelerate downward.

*   **Important Disclaimer:** This is *not* trade advice. The best outcome would be if my analysis is wrong, demonstrating how to navigate the week.

*   **Potential Reversal Scenario:**
    *   If a gap lower occurs and price starts to rise, it must respect the inefficiency.
    *   Price must stay below the low but can spike to the consequent encroachment of the wick.

*   **Fair Value Gap and Wick Considerations:**
    *   In this scenario, the wick's encroachment would be the consequent encroachment of a fair value gap.
    *   I would disregard the volume balance in this case, expecting it to act as a breakaway gap.

*   **Desired Market Behavior:** Gap lower and willingness to continue moving lower.

*   **Market Maker Sell Model & Bearish Order Block:**
    *   Sell-side liquidity is the ultimate target.
    *   A nice continuation with a market maker sell model was seen (amplified on the 4-hour chart of NASDAQ).
    *   A bearish order block is present.

*   **Market's Target:** Reaching for sell-side liquidity.

*   **60-Minute Chart Insights:**
    *   Sell-side imbalance, buy-side inefficiency, trade up into the breaker.
    *   High, low, higher high pattern.

*   **Bearish Sentiment:** The market leaving a small portion open is exceedingly bearish. I'd like to see that continue.

#### **NASDAQ Analysis**

*   **Gold Commentary:** Will be provided on Twitter tomorrow during the New York session.

*   **Weekly Chart (NASDAQ):**
    *   The quarterly shift objective is still down below.
    *   Consequent encroachment of the buy-side imbalance and sell-side liquidity are expected to be drawn in.

*   **Inefficiency Test:** The market worked up into an old inefficiency that's shaded.

*   **Wick Behavior:** Price got above the consequent encroachment but fell short of the upper quadrant (it could have spiked to it, just outside the fair value gap).

*   **Daily Chart (NASDAQ):** Obvious sell-side liquidity resting below.

*   **Desired Opening Scenario (NASDAQ):** Gap open below the blue line.

*   **Alternative Opening Scenario:** If the opening is relatively unchanged:
    *   Expect a roll-up to a certain point, then resume lower.
    *   The key level for that roll-up is the consequent encroachment at **757**.

*   **Preferred Scenario:** Opening below, directly targeting liquidity.

*   **4-Hour Chart (NASDAQ): Market Maker Sell Model**
    *   Original consolidation, re-visited.
    *   Accumulation, re-accumulation, smart money reversal, low-risk sell.
    *   First stage distribution, second stage redistribution.

*   **Unwillingness Below Consolidation:** The market hasn't yet gone below the original consolidation.

*   **4-Hour Inefficiency:** Inside the inefficiency, I wanted to see price trade back up into it and treat it as an inversion fair value gap, but it was unwilling to get there.

*   **Relative Equal Lows:** Despite relative equal lows, the liquidity below the larger 4-hour area is a better draw.

*   **15-Minute Time Frame:**
    *   Slight open gap higher occurred (not ideal).

*   **Trade Management:** Successfully managed the trade on Friday by tightening the stop loss and letting it take me out.

*   **Initial Commentary Reflection:** There wasn't anything troubling or worrisome enough to cause excitement.

*   **Market Sentiment:**
    *   Expecting things to get worse overall.
    *   Taking into account all the current events that have to do with the war that could escalate, creating violence that influences market conditions.

*   **Market Behavior Prediction:**
    *   **No Escalation:** If there is no escalation we'll eventually run back up into this the first two days of the week
    *   **Escalation**: If we escalate, this will stay in place and we'll just keep going lower

*   **Key Levels and Breaker:**
    *   High, low, high formation identifies the down-closed candle as a bearish breaker.

*   **Recent Trade:**
    *   Traded right back up into it, with my two entries right in there.
    *   Ultimately stopped out with a trailed stop loss.

*    **YouTube Channel Announcement:**
    *   The last model (Market Maker Sell Model) will be shared on **October 31st at 9:00 AM New York local time**.
    *   This will conclude the structured teaching portion of the 2023 mentorship.
    *   Live streams and market reviews may still occur between now and November 10th.

#### **Closing Remarks:**

*   Be careful this week.
*   Trade small, use stop losses, and avoid over-leveraging.
*   Be safe until the next session.

Okay, here's the organized and refined version of the provided text, designed to enhance clarity, readability, and analytical accessibility while preserving every detail and nuance.

**Video Analysis: Inner Circle Trader's Market Maker Models**

**Video URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKsIbUblSWM

**Important Disclaimer:** This teaching represents the closest viewpoint to how I actually trade, but it requires a comprehensive understanding of all PD Arrays. This is the last teaching lecture on the Inner Circle Trader YouTube channel.

**I. Understanding the Market Maker Model's Foundation**

*   **Reliance on PD Arrays:** The market maker model hinges on your familiarity with every PD Array I've previously presented.

*   **Price Observation:** The ability to recognize patterns and signals in price is crucial, but this depends on your knowledge of specific PD Arrays.

    *   **Examples:**
        *   **Breakers**
        *   **Mitigation Blocks**
        *   **Inversion Fair Value Gaps**

*   **Impact of Knowledge Gaps:** If you lack understanding of these elements, you might miss critical observations in live price action, such as identifying Market Maker Buy or Sell Models.

*   **Student Experiences:** Some students quickly grasp Market Maker Models due to their wide familiarity with PD Arrays beyond just order blocks or breakers.

*   **Gradual Understanding:** This is about graduating to understanding and not rushing the process.

**II. Expectations and Challenges**

*   **Difficulty Level:** This is an advanced topic and will likely be challenging for many. I am not going to sugarcoat that.
*   **Prior Knowledge Required:** This lesson assumes familiarity with all concepts taught in my private mentorship.

*   **I told my private mentorship students that:**
    *   Multitudes of Market Maker Sell and Buy Models will initially be missed.
    *   Models may only become apparent after the fact.

**III. The Power of Journaling**

*   **Don't Discount Missed Opportunities:** Log, journal, and mark up these instances to learn from them.
*   **Annotation:** Annotate in a way that makes it look like you saw it coming.

*   **Benefits of Journaling:**
    *   **Pseudo-Experience:** Conditions the brain to view patterns positively.
    *   **Rewarding Experience:** Subconscious avoids distraction from "painful" experiences.
    *   **Personalized Learning:** Journaling in your own words reinforces understanding.

*   **Contrast with Unprepared Trading:** Trading with real money without journaling leads to:

    *   **Ego involvement**
    *   **Pride**
    *   **Pain**

These elements can hinder learning. Reading price action without monetary risk eliminates these distractions.

**IV. Brevity and Reversal Concept**

*   **Market Maker Buy Model Application:** Everything discussed for the Market Maker Sell Model should be reversed to apply to a Market Maker Buy Model.

*   **Existing Resources:** Previous lectures and teachings on Market Maker Buy Models are available on my YouTube channel.

*   **Foundation Assumed:** This lesson builds upon previous teachings.

**V. Target Audience and Content Level**

*   **Advanced Content:** This teaching is not for beginners. It's considered an advanced topic.
*   **Personal Framework:** It represents how I internalize price action during trading approximately 99% of the time.

*   **Model Disclosure:** I may not always disclose the exact Market Maker Buy or Sell Model being traded.

**VI. Fragmentizing Price Swings**

*   **Conceptual Fragmentation:** Price swings can be broken down into segments representing parts of a Market Maker Model (Buy or Sell).

*   **Unique Models:** These segments can form the basis of your own unique trading model.

*   **Trading Preference:** It's up to the individual to decide if you want to trade the bottom of a buy model to the top, or the top of a sell model to the bottom.

*   **Buy and Sell Curves:** Understanding the buy-side and sell-side curves is critical, and will be discussed.

**VII. Defining Swing Trading Through Algorithmic Price Delivery**

*   **Algorithmic Price Delivery:** My Market Maker Models represent my interpretation of swing trading and creating a language around it.
*   **Swing Trading Defined:**
    *   **Bullish:** Trading from discount to premium, following buy-side delivery.
    *   **Bearish:** Trading from premium to discount, following sell-side delivery.

**VIII. Distinguishing Liquidity and Delivery**

*   **Buy-Side and Sell-Side Concepts:** When I mention Buy-Side and Sell-Side you should think of Liquidity.
*   **Important distinction:** I am going to draw a distinction between liquidity and delivery.
*   **Relative Equal Highs Example:**

    *   **Anticipation:** We should expect a run above relative equal highs.
    *   **Building Block:** Understanding this is a fundamental step to identifying Market Maker Sell Models.

**IX. Narrative and Scope Considerations**

*   **Beyond Simple Highs/Lows:** Understanding Market Intent is vital beyond identifying relative equal highs and lows.
*   **Narrative Considerations:** Determine what the market is trying to do and gravitate to.

    *   Longer term Uptrend or
    *   Rally to trap people into being long, then moving lower for longer.

*   **Narrative Excluded:** The narrative is outside the scope of this teaching.
*   **Complexity:** This model is not as simple as the Silver Bullet or Model 2022.

**X. Learning from Price Action Observation**

*   **Inspired to trade like me:** If you're trying to trade like me, you're going to have to learn to do what I'm talking about here.

*   **If content:** If you're not inspired to trade like me and are content with trading the Silver Bullet or Model 2022, then wonderful. You do not need this level of understanding.

*   **Price Action Review:** Review price action daily, weekly, and monthly to identify these models.
*   **Pattern Recognition:** By identifying these types of models you will have a better understanding of what they look like in the future.
*   **Independent Discovery:** You must identify these models yourself to build familiarity, rather than relying on others.

**XI. Advanced Interpretation of Price Movement**

*   **Buy Side Delivery:** This here and this here should be able to be seen as relative equal highs
*   **Conceptual Explanation:** We should be able to see those relative equal highs, in order to understand the ideas being put forth.
*   **Assumed Bearish Stance:** We should hold a bearish stance, meaning we look at every rally as a suspect rally.
*   **Reversal Qualification:** We should be looking for some measure of reversal, and once that reversal is qualified and meets the criteria for a Market Maker Sell Model, then we can engage.

*   **Advanced forms:**
    *   **Anticipating the run above highs**: We can be long prior to it.
    *   **Buying/Shorting on the curve**: Buying during the buy side of the curve, and shorting during the sell side of the curve. This is *very* Advanced

*   **Individual Pace:** Learn at your own pace and don't try to rush or keep up with others. You are never going to catch up to others that have been studying the market since 1996.

**XII. Universality of Concepts**

*   **Market Applicability:** These ideas are universal and apply to any market with a price feed that can be traded.

*   **Concept:** This whole idea from this run-up to that level there is what I refer to as **Buy Side Delivery**.

    *   **Definition:** When price is running higher it's offering buy side.

**XIII. Buy Side vs Sell Side Delivery**

*   **Purpose**: It is running up to engage the liquidity that would be resting above these relative equal highs.

*   **Buy Side Delivery vs Liquidity**:
    *   **Directional Movement**: As prices go higher this is Buy Side Delivery
    *   **Liquidity**: Liquidity above a single or a group of highs
        *   **Orders**: Stagnant price levels where stops would reside. Buyers to break out and go long or to protect a short position.

*   **Sell Side Delivery:**
    *   **Liquidity**: Is a stagnant price level, or levels where stops would be.
    *   **Buy Side Delivery**: Is the actual animated movement of price moving higher.
    *   **Sell Side Delivery**: Is when we are looking at price going lower.
        *   **Purpose**: Running above the relative equal highs that function has been performed.
        *   **Bearish Move**: If we're bearish then price could move lower and then trade back below the previous rally low.

*   **Liquidity Traps:** Buy side delivery to the upside to engage liquidity trap traders. Smart money would go short and write it back down.

*   **Sell Side Engagements**: If anyone was lucky enough to go long in this, but kept a stop loss here or inside this run-up during the buy side delivery, their stop loss will be tagged out.

*   **Engineered Liquidity**: Reaching for the new engineered Sell Side Liquidity which would be the sell stops on longs that anyone would have been going long here.

*   **Reverse Positions**: Rally up to take buy side and then rip rate back down to take the sell side on those individuals that were trying to go long and weren't astute enough to reverse, or at the very minimum close out in a profitable position.

**XIV. Candlestick Analysis**

*   **Pause and Observe:** Pause the video before I start talking and make observations about what you think you see here, what's Salient to you, and when you're ready unpause the video.

*   **Candlestick Depiction:** The same idea of price action is being depicted, instead of a line chart.

*   **Individual Analysis:** By utilizing that closing price only, we don't see the highest high and the lowest low, but with the closing price here we're looking at the highest high and the lowest low, and the open and close of every individual candlestick of this respective time frame.

*   **Run Up:** The market rallies up here after seeing the relative equal highs here with this high and this High.
        All of this is the **Buy Side Delivery** and the subsequent **Sell Side Delivery** attacking the sell side that was created after the run higher.

*   **Liquidity Engagement**: This run higher attacks the relative equal highs where liquidity is.

*   **Market Direction** Markets go up for two primary reasons.
        *   **Buy Stops:** One it goes up to engage buy stops which is buy side liquidity.
        *   **Inefficienty**: Two it goes up to an inefficiency.

**XV. Fair Value Gaps Explained**

*   **Price Observation**: If you look right here that's an inefficiency.
*   **Definition**
    *   There is a small little segment of price action where the previous candle's low stops here, the next candle opens trades up a little bit goes lower, the next candle we open trade up stop here and then we move lower.
    *   There is a separation between these three candles here, one candle in the middle.

*   **Fair Value Gap Explanation** This is what I call a **Fair Value Gap**, and it's a very specific price level that we look for and it's one of the most visual things you can see from my repertoire.
    *   **Visual Recognition**: The things I teach, your eye should jump right to it when you see it.
    *   **Highlight:** In this case, if you missed it you can see clearly now it's highlighted.

*   **Gap Type**: Because it's a down closed candle what kind of inefficiency is it?

*   **Inefficiency Definition**:
    *   A fair value Gap classified as a *CBI Siby* sell side imbalance buy side inefficiency meaning when these form the Market's algorithm.
    *   These produce fluctuations in price, not because of buying and selling pressure. The market rallies to these predetermined levels.

*   **Market Rally**: The Market Rallies to these predetermind levels because it has to offer what here? This one single candle went lower, so what does it need to do if it's going to be an efficient market?

*   **Required Action**:
    *   It needs to trade up back in between these two price points.
    *   This candles low to this candles high.

*   **Trading Up**:
    *   This candle trades up to it where does the close stop right at the high of it.
    *   The next candle we open and we trade back down.
        *   Yes, there was a small wick here.
        *   That is permissable, but the bodies tell us the narrative.

*   **Rally Definition**: All of this rally up here was under the pretense that we would see it just simply trade back to this little area here above the buy side above this high and this high.

*   **Draw on Liquidity**: ICT how far can it go above these relative equal highs?
        *   You'd have to look to see if there's any close proximity inefficiencies, in this case we have one right here.

*   **Fair Value Gap Location**:
    *   Notice this candles tail goes way lower then we open trade back up making the low of the fair value Gap and then we trade here lower then the next candle we open went lower.

*   **Multiple Candles**: All of these three candles here we've had a lot of back and forth price action.

*   **Gap Recognition**: There is no fair value Gap here we can clearly see there's a gap because there's only one candle making that defined range of that low of that candle and that candle's high.

*   **Algorithm Patch**: The algorithm will go back to that and repic to it.

*   **Closing Candles**: By going back up to it and offering a patch filling in this Only One Singular down closed candle.

*   **Efficienty**: Now we have an up Clos candle laying directly right over top of it so it patches over the inefficiency here in price.

**XVI. Complexity Reminder and Other Models**

*   **Supporting Studies**: To understand what my Market Maker Model is, you have to understand a plethora of other supporting studies.

*   **Long Learning Curve**: It's going to take a lot of time to understand the the full magnitude of what's available in terms of deciphering and reading price.

*   **Nimble Requirement**: You have to be more nimble when using a Market Maker Sell and Buy Model.

*   **Don't be Discouraged**: This is to remind you that it's going to take a whole lot more effort than you probably realize going into this.

*   **Other Elementary Models**: I've made available very very simple straightforward Elementary models using the concepts I've created. If you get discouraged after this, just know that you can.


Okay, here's the organized and refined version of the provided text, designed to enhance clarity, readability, and analytical accessibility while preserving every detail and nuance.

**XVII. Reverting to Simpler Models and Detailed Market Analysis**

*   **Simpler Models:** Always revert back to the **Silver Bullet**, **2022 Model**, or **Optimal Trade Entry** models, as they are very simple.

*   **Market Run-Up and Down Analysis:** Let's go into greater detail here about how the market ran up into this area and focus on how it went down.

    *   **Beyond Cell-Side Liquidity:** Not just simply below the cell side of that original rally up, but it went down to this old low right here.
    *   **Close Observation:** Look real close; you'll see that it went just below that.
    *   **Non-Random Occurrence:** This is not random.

*   **Bid Balance Cell-Side Inefficiency (Bissy):** This right here is a **Bid Balance Cell-Side Inefficiency (Bissy)**.
    *   **Definition:** It's the opposite of this singular candle here.
    *   **Up-Close Candle:** It's an up-close candle, so it wouldn't be a CBI; it would be a Bissy.
    *   **Digging Into:** It digs into this just by a little bit, but specifically right below that low.
    *   **Non-Randomness:** Again, that's not random. These are things I like to look for.

*   **Recurring Bissy Pattern:** You can also see how we had that same thing occurring here.

    *   **Bissy Definition:** This is a bid balance inefficiency again, the opposite of this up-closed candle.
        *   Up closed candles that create a **Fair Value Gap** or inefficiency is referred to as a Bissy.
    *   **PD Array Classification:** The classification by PD Array is Fair Value Gap, but it's an up-close candle, so it's a buy-side imbalance sell-side inefficiency.
        *   Meaning the price will want to go back down to it eventually.

    *   **Inbalance and Repricing:** In here, we have that imbalance and then trades wear down.
    *   **Order Block:** Once it gets into there, reprices to the order block.
    *   **Rally Back Up:** Then, it rallies back up creating the initial stage of what a shift in Market structure Above This High here.

*   **Anticipating High Reach:** So now, we can look for a retracement back down.

    *   As it's retracing, we're anticipating the price doing what?
        *   Eventually reaching for the high here and here, so we can look for a lower time frame to give us a scenario where if we think it's going to go above these relative equal highs.

*   **Fair Value Gap Visibility:** We can see that this **Fair Value Gap** wasn't hiding; it's in plain view.

    *   **Annotation Encouragement:** It should stand out on your chart. That's why you're encouraged by me to annotate them when you see them.

*   **Draw on Liquidity Considerations:** If you see a draw on liquidity that's setting up above or below the marketplace, don't just limit your focus to that.

    *   **Close Proximity Assessment:** Look in close proximity just above these buy-side liquidity highs here that are relatively equal.
    *   **Potential Reach:** How far can it go above it?
    *   **Inefficiency Check:** Looking over here, there's no inefficiency here, but there is one right there.
    *   **Body Stop Observation:** How far can it go above these relative equal High there, and look where the body stop?

        *   That's not random.

**XVIII. Lower Timeframe Analysis and Market Structure**

*   **Zooming and Lower Time Frame Chart:** We're going to zoom in here a little bit and drop down into a lower time frame chart here.
    *   **Lecture Caution:** Don't worry, I'll let you know what this is as we get to the close of the lecture, but just stick to what I'm showing you here.

*   **Buy Side Delivery:** We have the low buy side delivery trading up into the Fair Value Gap that was on a time frame that was 60 minutes.
    *   **Time Frame:** But now we're on a 15minute, so this time frame here is a 15-minute time frame.
        *   One quarter of what was shown as the previous chart, so there's four times the number of candles.
    *   **Reference Point:** I've given you a reference point that it was based on a 60 Minute or hourly Fair Value Gap in the form of a CBI sell sign and balance by sign efficiency.

*   **Body Respect:** Still, you can see the body is respecting, and only the candlesticks Wicks are piercing it.

    *   See see that.
    *   **Indication:** That's very, very indicative of qualifying the fact that we've went up to a specific level and therefore we can trust that the algorithm is kind of like broadcasting to those that know how to look at it and see it that it's likely to now reic lower repic to where below this low.

*   **Accelerated Run and Efficiency Search:** Any accelerated run below this low, how far can it go?

    *   **No Efficiencies Above:** Is there any efficiencies over here? Don't look at this one because that's above that low.
        *   We would already be anticipating retracement back below that where will we look?

*   **Rejection Block and Relative Equal Lows:** The rejection block, which is the lowest down close, and then we have these relative equal lows here.

    *   **Just Below Observation:** You see it just goes a little bit below that low rate there.
        *   We're going to get into this in a moment; for now, just notice that we have ran above that buy side that old high here that old high here shift in Market structure on the hourly chart Above This High here.

*   **Retracement and Fair Value Gap:** So it's retracing what's it retracing back down into the fair value got order block right there.

    *   **Consolidation Expectation:** So now, does the market offer a consolidation? That's what we would be expecting here.
        *   Is it consolidating?
        *   Is it offering a small little pause in price where it goes sideways for a little while, which would be accumulating long positions that's allowing smart money to accumulate longs.

*   **Zoom and Time Frame Confirmation:** I'm going to zoom in this is the same time frame.

    *   **Low Pointing:** 15 minute, here's that low. You can see how we just went below it right here.
        *   See that?
    *   **Inside Observation:** Here's that low inside the Fair Value Gap with the order block which is a down Clos candle.
    *   **Consolidation Anticipation:** Again, we would be anticipating some measure of consolidation, not dropping lower consolidation.
        *   Because that means we would be anticipating a run above the buy side here and the previous height is to the left outside the scope of what I'm zoomed in on now, but you can see it's still being highlighted.
    *   **Minute Fair Value:** That 60 Minute Fair Value got in the form of a cell sign and balance byid efficiency that's here.

**XIX. Five-Minute Chart Analysis, Balanced Price Ranges, and Trap Traders**

*   **Lower Time Frame (Five Minute):** What we're going to do is we're going to drop down to a even lower time frame and see if there's any more detail in here with a f minute chart.

*   **Highlighted Area:** Now we're inside of a lower time frame five minute chart and I've highlighted now this little area right down here.

*   **Balanced Price Range:** I told you we would talk about that in here, we're looking at a balanced price range.
    *   **Definition:** A balanced price range is where the market has both a downside and upside or sells side delivery and buy side delivery that overlap one another in the same relative range in price.
    *   **Candle Interaction:** You can see how this candle's high that candles low that would normally be what a sell sign balance byy side and efficiency, but look what's happened over here we have a high a big up closed candle and this candle's low so what does that make this a bid balance cell efficiency.
    *   **Overlapping Range:** There's an overlapping between a CBI and a Bissy within the general area of the same price range so I'm using the low here and the high here so that way we can see how this becomes a balanced price range these are trapped Traders.

*   **Trap Traders:** This in here is a trap Trader or trap traders that would have been caught short in the classic days of commodity trading.
    *   **Island Reversal:** If you were to see old patterns like what would be considered an island reversal.
        *   This is the closest thing that I can kind of use to describe what's occurring when there is a balanced price range when it's extreme like this.
    *   **Extreme Decline:** When we have a big decline large range candle that's down and then eventually not like months later not weeks later but when it's a big drop and a handful of candlesticks like this it's not a whole lot of candles then eventually you know rip back higher that means that this was someone that's been caught their short and they quickly repriced and leave them down there.
        *   When I see that I look to see where those two reference points are where the market drops quickly for sells side delivery and then when it rallies back up quickly those one big candles down one big candle's up all the price ACS and below it I would view that as trap Trader.
        *   That means by itself that gives me narrative that it's probably going to go higher.

*   **Narrative and Reach Cue:** So now cue up the idea of what would it be reaching for.
    *   **Inefficiency Drop:** Well we see it was dropping back down into an inefficiency here the buy side here and old high back to the left and that 60 Minute Fair Value Gap that's a CBI up here we're still in a 15-minute time frame by the way I'm I miscued it earlier calling a five minute see the idea of the market consolidating.

**XX. Consolidation, Market Maker Models, and Retail Theory**

*   **Consolidation Idea:** That's what we're showing here now how am I referencing this consolidation.
    *   **Knack:** This is the part of it that becomes like a knack.
    *   **Framing:** You might not have the exact candles framed like this when you see an original consolidation so when I call a original consolidation that is where the market is accumulating so what I did here I seen these two candles here and then the body of this one and the body of this one so right away my eye jumps to that because it's what it's a smooth edge so I want to use that as the high of the original consolidation what's the low the lowest low see how easy that was.
    *   **Repetitive Level:** When I'm looking at the original consolidations I'm looking for a repetitive overlapping or reoccurrence of a level that's being constantly referred back to inside of consolidation.
        *   Now I'm anticipating the market to go higher to go above the buy side here and then reach up into this inefficiency up here but I'm anticipating also that it should offer some measure of consolidation because if it's going to do that my premise behind swing trading is it's all on the basis of a market maker sell model or a market maker buy model that's what swing trading is whether you realize it or not whether you want to subscribe to it or not that's what the Market's doing it's not doing harmonic stuff it's not doing L8 wave stuff it's moving on the principles of running to liquidity or it's running to inefficiencies and if it's not doing that it's consolidating and if it's not doing that it's highly manipulated and then you're having some kind of manual intervention some kind of shockin all surprise rate announcement some kind of wartime event something that would destabilize the marketplace that you can't and I can't predict before it happens okay so that's always always the underlying incurred risk that we have as speculators.

*   **Framing and Constant Referrals:** This area here is where I'm framing that you can see still look how many times it's referring to that same level that's based over here so when I'm looking at consolidations I'm looking at levels that constantly repeat I'm not just going to lay over top of this high or this high or this High I'm looking for something that frames it very clearly now when you go back and look at my examples when I'm doing this in the past and I've been doing for a long long long time since the 90s but the examples I've made public look and see how I'm drawing your attention to these specific consolidations do you see it do you see it as a consolidation go back and look at your other annotations that maybe you have journaled before start looking at it like this so that way when you understand it when the market does eventually leave the original consolidation because we're underlyingly bullish we have traders that are trapped down here they don't want to drop down below to give them an opportunity to get out even though the market does eventually drop lower here they may not come back down into this area until a later time it could be weeks it could be days it could be hours it could be you know a time that's unknown to you that's outside the scope of the the presentation here what you're looking for and what I'm looking for is trades that make sense where the Market's reaching for liquidity and efficiencies and then reversing for the sake of going back against the original consolidation where people are going to see this as a support level.

*   **Attacking Support Resistance and Inefficiencies:** I don't trade support resistance I attack support resistance I attack liquidity above old highs I attack liquidity below old lows and I use inefficiencies as targets or means of Entry to trade against those same ideas which would be anti- retail Theory I'm against it I'm opposed to retail Theory anything retail if it's support resistance harmonic patterns Elliot wave G wi off all that stuff that's all retail logic and my understanding is that's the reason why that 90% people that try to use all that stuff fail and they and they fail rather quickly.

*   **Consolidation Framing and Algorithm Highlight:** When we can frame the original consolidation properly then once we leave it how do we how are we leaving it here look at the body right there yeah we had a wick here we had a wick right there too but look at the body St inside that original consolidation see that that's characteristic to algorithmic price delivery it's indicating to individuals that I'm trying to show you that this is the language that traders that use this information and the algorithms The High Frequency trading algorithms they highlight these things in price and so it gets their highfrequency trading algorithm in the hunt for long entries when is it allowed to take the long that candle right there tells you.

*   **Returning to Consolidation and Market Entries:** So now we can then refer back to the same level here if it trades back to that level what's it doing it's returning back to the original consolidation that's how I teach my market maker in sell model and buy model the original consolidation it can leave it it doesn't have to touch it but if it does that's usually a trade so this would be your your original entry okay so you could go long there but sometimes it won't offer a return back to the original consolidation so it might just need a higher order entry and not offer something right at the high of the original consolidation the market rallies up trades right into that 60-minute fair Val got CBI bodies tell the narrative it's not interest in going any higher.

*   **Inefficiency and Multiple Entries:** Why because look at this big candle drop down there wonderful we have an inefficiency here we have an inefficiency here drops aggressively below the original consolidation right back to the high of the Balan price range right there which is also just below that old low right there that make these relative equal lows what suspect for cells side so cells side liquidity resting below there that's the draw if it's going to go well beyond the low here where the original consolidation cell side liquidity would be resting so in in layman's terms what saying is it's building up a lot of interest to go higher then it rips higher comes back down gives one more chance okay one more chance then takes off takes Above This High here then reaches up into the INE efficiency then at that point does it indicate that it wants to go lower because if you're bearish and you're extremely bearish to the degree where you think this is a good entry point you could sell up here as it does that and that's a little scary I understand that but eventually you get these multiple entries in here where you can go short we'll look at them in Greater detail in a minute but eventually the idea was to draw back down into this area here but if it goes below this how far can it go there's no inefficiency over here it's these relative equal lows and that's where the market drops [Music] to all right so now we have more candlesticks and now this is the F minute chart so here's the original consolidation you see the market does in fact drop back down in inversion fair value Gap.

**XXI. Inversion Fair Value Gaps and Pause Instruction**

*   **Inversion Fair Value Gap:** I don't have it highlighted because it would be too many things on the chart, but for you that's inversion fair value Gap.

    *   **Meaning:** Meaning that usually that would be sell side and balance by side efficiency if the market trades back up into it we would see it what trade lower but if it's an inversion fair value Gap it means it's going to go above it come back down and use it as a discount array and it's inside of the original consolidation and rallies takes the buy side trades the 60-minute Fair Value Gap CBI even in the 5 minute look at the candlesticks the bodies they're inside that CBI it's indicating that yes there's Wicks going on in here but that's just the the the damage okay where it's reaching for the best case for smart money to get short against and then we see it drop lower zoomed in on that F minute chart here we have the original consolidation the rally up and I want you to pause the video again and it if you're not doing this I promise you you're really not getting the same measure of understanding and the opportunity to see it in your own eyes and test your observations you might not get it right but that's okay trying and attempting to do it and seeing things with detail you might not have it exactly right but what happens if you do have the things I'm going to point out it's encouraging so don't Rob yourself the opportunity to have that so pause the video take a look at all the price run from here up to here and then down what do you see all right if you haven't paused the


Okay, here's the organized and refined version of the provided text, designed to enhance clarity, readability, and analytical accessibility while preserving every detail and nuance.

**XXI. Inversion Fair Value Gaps and Pause Instruction (Continued)**

*   **Continuation Note:** It is highly recommended that you pause the video to enhance understanding and test your own observations.

    *   **Observational Goal:** Analyze the price run from the specified point up to the high, and then the subsequent move downwards.

*   **Returning to Original Consolidation:** The speaker's focus is drawn to the return to the original consolidation after the market rally.

    *   **Bullish Breaker Identification:**
        *   A down-closed candle appears just below the referenced area.
        *   The up-closed candle becomes a bullish breaker, characterized by a low, high, and lower low.
        *   This creates a down-closed candle within the breaker candle, which is identified as a bullish order block.

    *   **Target Identification:** The initial target is the liquidity resting above the high and the older high to the left.
        *   While not within the immediate fractal price action, it is highlighted by a line.

    *   **Accumulation Stages:**
        *   The initial drop might indicate the first stage of accumulation for those not accurately identifying the original consolidation.
        *   The second stage of reaccumulation occurs here as the market rallies upwards.

**XXII. Flexible Interpretation and Accumulation Strategies**

*   **Adapting to Understanding:** The classification of accumulation stages can vary based on individual understanding and experience levels.

    *   **Correctness in Perspective:** Both classifications (return to consolidation or bullish order block) are valid based on one's level of experience and understanding.
    *   **Key Difference:** The main difference lies in how the original consolidation is mapped out.

*   **Potential Alternative Interpretations:**

    *   Some traders may interpret the movement as the taking of relative equal highs, leading to an expectation of further downward movement.
    *   This interpretation might occur if the broader narrative is not fully understood.

*   **Down Close Candle Significance:**

    *   Within a bullish price run, during buy-side delivery targeting the specified area, the down-close candle offers an entry point for the first stage of accumulation.
    *   Alternatively, it could represent the second stage of reaccumulation for those who identified an earlier entry.

*   **Important Considerations:**

    *   It's essential to understand that there might be only one accumulation point without a return to the original consolidation.
    *   Price could rapidly increase, providing a single entry opportunity before a subsequent decline.

**XXIII. Mastering Market Maker Models and Increasing Setup Visibility**

*   **Comprehensive Understanding Requirement:**

    *   A thorough understanding of all taught concepts is necessary for effective trading of Market Maker Models.
    *   While simple Market Maker sell or buy models may be easily recognizable, deeper knowledge enhances the ability to identify a wider range of potential setups.

*   **Trader Mindset and Entry Preferences:**

    *   Consider which entry points align with your trading style and understanding.
    *   Some traders prefer waiting for a return to the original consolidation before initiating a long position.
    *   Others are more inclined to enter after a rally, considering it the first stage of accumulation.

*   **Potential Shorting Strategies and the "Unicorn" Setup:**

    *   Some traders may identify the first stage accumulation, wait for a rally to a specific point, and then initiate short positions, pyramiding entries while anticipating a move below.
    *   The "Unicorn" setup represents a second-stage redistribution within a Market Maker sell model, characterized by overwhelmingly favorable conditions.

*   **Unicorn Characteristics:**
    *   It involves a clear and energetic swing high from which price sharply declines.
    *   Successful identification requires accurate labeling of all elements and agreement between time and price.
    *   This setup often leads to rapid and significant price drops in low-resistance liquidity runs.

**XXIV. Identifying and Capitalizing on Low Resistance Liquidity Runs**

*   **Prioritizing Efficient Trades:** The speaker prioritizes identifying and trading the easiest, highest-speed, low-resistance liquidity runs.

    *   These runs are typically associated with the second-stage redistribution in a Market Maker sell model.

*   **Alternative Entry Points and Consequent Encroachment:**

    *   If the initial entry is missed, a buy-balance sell-side inefficiency, specifically the consequent encroachment (midpoint) of the inefficiency, can offer another opportunity.
    *   This can be a bullish fair value gap consequent encroachment, serving as a second-stage reaccumulation point.

*   **Advanced Strategies and Smart Money Reversals:**

    *   Experienced traders may employ advanced techniques such as "selling the Mohawks," capitalizing on bodies indicating a failure to breach the 60-minute fair value gap CBI.
    *   Entries are made just outside of PD arrays highs, representing extreme overbought conditions without relying on indicators.
    *   These "smart money reversals" require years of experience and a deep understanding of market dynamics.

*   **Cautious Approach to Top Picking:**

    *   While "picking tops" in bearish markets can be a viable strategy with experience, it is generally discouraged in bullish markets due to the risk of prices exceeding expectations.
    *   Bearish markets offer greater predictability and clearer patterns for identifying potential reversal points.

**XXV. Managing Risk and Trading within Market Structures**

*   **Strategic Entry and Stop Loss Placement:**

    *   Once a market breaks lower, rallies back up should be viewed critically.
    *   The consequent encroachment of the 60-minute fair value gap CBI becomes a low-risk short opportunity, assuming previous "Mohawking" above.
    *   Stop-loss orders are placed just above the highest high or the consequent encroachment of the wick.

*   **Adapting to Stop-Out Scenarios:**

    *   If stopped out, it's recommended to wait for the price to move lower, test the fair value gap low, and re-enter with a stop above the new highest high.

*   **Understanding the Curve Concept:**

    *   The speaker introduces the concept of the "curve," dividing the market into buy-side and sell-side delivery phases.
    *   The highest high formed during buy-side delivery marks the transition to the sell-side curve.

*   **Exploiting Inefficiencies and Liquidity Targets:**

    *   The goal of sell-side delivery is to reprice under the original accumulation, targeting sell-side liquidity and the stops placed below by traders anticipating further upward movement.

**XXVI. Analyzing Price Action and Breaker Patterns**

*   **Conditions for Downward Movement:**

    *   Specific criteria must be met for the market to start dropping, including a breaker high, a high body staying inside the PD array on the 60-minute timeframe, and favorable overall market conditions.

*   **Breaker Identification and Trading:**

    *   Taking out the low creates a fair value gap, potentially forming a trade setup.
    *   A bearish breaker pattern emerges, triggering the first stage of distribution.

*   **Strategic Short Entry and Managing Risk:**

    *   Traders may wait for a smart money reversal, seeking a low-risk short opportunity.
    *   Tape reading skills are valuable for identifying willingness to run away from the area.

*   **Addressing Retail Trading Fallacies:**

    *   The speaker firmly rejects the use of support and resistance, trend lines, and other retail-based trading methods.
    *   These methods are considered ineffective, emphasizing the importance of understanding price action, narrative, and liquidity/inefficiency dynamics.

**XXVII. Advanced Order Block Analysis and Exploiting the Curve**

*   **Advanced Order Block Analysis:**

    *   A bearish order block, characterized by an up-close candle, represents the second stage of redistribution, typically leading to the fastest downward movement.
    *   If this setup is missed, traders risk chasing price.

*   **Alternative Perspectives on Distribution:**

    *   If the low-risk short at the order block isn't recognized, the trader may perceive the first stage of distribution differently.
    *   Understanding the potential for a sudden drop is crucial to avoid being caught off guard.

*   **Curve Dynamics and Bullish Order Block Reversal:**

    *   The speaker notes the potential reversal of a bullish order block on the sell-side of the curve.
    *   A down-closed candle, previously offering support during buy-side delivery, should now act as resistance.
    *   Examining the body stopping at this level validates the block's continued significance.
*   **Rejecting Oversimplified Concepts:** The speaker asserts that those who teach order block theory do not know what they are doing and calls their ideas Mythology.


Okay, here's the organized and refined version of the provided text, designed to enhance clarity, readability, and analytical accessibility while preserving every detail and nuance.

**XXVIII. Market Maker Models and Redistribution Stages**

*   **Second Stage Redistribution:** When the market trades back up to the "butt end" of the body of a candle, this can be classified as the second stage of redistribution.

    *   **Alternative Perspective:** If one views the initial move as the first stage, this retracement becomes a low-risk short or a "smart money reversal."
    *   **Pyramiding Entries:** In the speaker's methodology, this represents an opportunity for pyramiding entries, increasing short positions.

*   **Return to Original Consolidation:** After the redistribution phase, the price typically drops back into the original consolidation area.

    *   **Profit Taking:** Approximately 80% of the trade should be taken off the table at this point.
    *   **Assessing Further Potential:** The remaining position is used to gauge the market's ability to move even lower.
    *   **Deep Retracement and Lower Lows:** The speaker observes that the market retraces deeply before ultimately moving lower.

**XXIX. The Importance of Time and Price in Market Analysis**

*   **Asset Class Agnostic Nature:** The speaker emphasizes that the concepts discussed apply to every asset class.

*   **Time and Price Agreement:** A key element mentioned is the agreement between time and price.

    *   **Time Sets the Stage:** Time frames provide the context for potential market moves.
    *   **Price Executes with Precision:** Price action then validates the expected outcome with accuracy.

*   **Specific Example (31st):**

    *   **Consolidation:** The market consolidates initially.
    *   **Departure and Return:** It then leaves the consolidation area before returning to the original consolidation.
    *   **London Open:** This return occurs during the London open.
    *   **Order Block Formation:** An order block forms during this period.
    *   **Rally into New York Open:** The market rallies into the New York open, driven by buy-side activity.

*   **Market Reversal Profile:** This sequence of events aligns with a market reversal profile, a component of a Market Maker sell model.

*   **New York Open Kill Zone:**

    *   **Inside the Kill Zone:** The action occurs within the New York open Kill Zone.
    *   **Breaker and Bearish Order Block:** A breaker pattern and a bearish order block are present.
    *   **Optimal Trade Entry:** This confluence of factors provides an optimal trade entry.

**XXX. Model 2022 and Silver Bullet Concepts**

*   **Model 2022:**

    *   **Buy-Side Liquidity Taken:** Buy-side liquidity is targeted and taken.
    *   **Shift in Market Structure:** A clear shift in market structure occurs.
    *   **Fair Value Gap:** A fair value gap emerges.
    *   **Short Entry:** Traders can initiate short positions based on this model.

*   **New York Open Kill Zone Silver Bullet:** The movement up into the previously mentioned, creates the New York Open Kill Zone Silver Bullet concept.
    *   **Time Frame:** 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM New York local time.

*   **Fair Value Gaps are Constant:** Fair Value gaps are consistently forming.
    *   **Narrative Context:** Understanding the prevailing narrative is essential for the specific trading session.
    *   **Operating Time:** It's crucial to consider the operating time frame used for trading.

*   **High-Volume Periods:** The speaker uses times with high trading volume.
    *   **Order Flow:** Rapid and increasing order flow is characteristic of these times.
    *   **Market Interest:** Significant market interest is present during these periods.

*   **Framing Trading Activity:**

    *   **Trading Time:** Traders can opt to trade for as little as one hour per day.
    *   **Kill Zone Duration:** Alternatively, they can trade for the duration of a full Kill Zone (two to three hours).

*   **Adapting to Individual Circumstances:** The speaker has previously outlined how to trade the London session for those unable to trade the New York session.

**XXXI. Range Extremes and Target Objectives**

*   **Anticipated Target Arrival Time:** Given the established market reversal profile and the presence of a Market Maker sell model, it is possible to anticipate when the market might reach its target.

    *   **Target:** Running down below relative equal lows.
    *   **Time Frame:** The London close, specifically between 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM New York local time.

*   **Non-Randomness:** The speaker emphasizes that this is not random but part of broader market patterns and teachings.
*   **Comprehensive Knowledge Requirement:** Traders must possess more than just a superficial understanding of Market Maker sell and buy models.

**XXXII. Gratitude and Closure**

*   **Mentorship Appreciation:** The speaker expresses gratitude for the opportunity to serve as a mentor.

*   **Sharing Accumulated Knowledge:** He is honored to have shared the knowledge and insights he has gathered over the last 30 years.

*   **Impact of Student Interactions:** He has been deeply touched by the adoration and respect shown by his students.

*   **Personal Time Constraints:** The speaker cites increasing demands on his personal time from his wife as a primary reason for reducing his social media and mentoring activities.

*   **Continued Content Availability:** All existing content on the speaker's YouTube channel and Twitter will remain available and unaltered.

*   **Wishing Success and Farewell:** The speaker wishes his audience success and concludes with "Good luck and good trading."

*   **Order block Theory:** The speaker asserts that those who teach order block theory do not know what they are doing and calls their ideas Mythology.

Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the text, maintaining all original details and nuance, and formatted for readability:

# **ES Futures Trade Analysis: Non-Farm Payroll Friday**

## **Initial Bullish Outlook**

*   Video URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A97shZGPE2I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A97shZGPE2I)
*   **General Sentiment**: Bullish, expecting price to press higher.
*   **Timeframe**: Analysis initiated on a 4-hour chart, then transitioned to a 15-minute timeframe, and later a 5-minute chart.

## **Fair Value Gap (FVG) Identification and Strategy**

### **4-Hour Chart Analysis**

*   Observed a 4-hour FVG.
*   Price action within the FVG is considered a discount relative to the low and high of the range.
*   Stop loss placement initially considered to be wider due to anticipated volatile price action from the non-farm payroll release.

### **15-Minute Chart Refinement**

*   Identified a smaller FVG within the larger 4-hour FVG.
*   Monitored price behavior within this smaller FVG for potential opportunities.
*   Successfully entered a trade, acknowledging that the position size might appear significant to some, but is relatively small in the grand scheme.
*   Took 5 handles off above.

### **Judah Swing Context**

*   The trade's importance is tied to the concept of a "**Judah Swing**".
*   Previous rally attempts failed to take out buy-side liquidity.
*   Market makers may be attempting to trick traders into trusting existing resistance levels.

### **Efficient vs. Inefficient Price Delivery**

*   Focused on a specific segment of price action, isolating the range between a high and a low.
*   **Concept of efficient delivery**: Analogized to a paint roller. Initially, ample paint is delivered, but eventually, gaps appear where the paint isn't equally distributed.
*   **Fair Value Gap (FVG) Definition**: A gap between a candle's high and the next candle's low where price hasn't retraced to at least touch the prior candle's high.
*   **Why "Fair Value Gap"**: Named it "Fair Value Gap" because it offers fair value if you're bullish.

### **Understanding FVG Dynamics**

*   Emphasized that a fair value gap represents a lack of movement back down to at least touch the high of the relevant candle.
*   Since price moves up without redistributing efficiency by retracing downwards, it must eventually offer a retracement at a later time.
*   Non-farm payroll data release at 8:30 AM coincided with price dropping back into the identified FVG (although slightly overshooting it).
*   The area is considered a balanced price range, part of the 4-hour FVG.

## **Post-FVG Analysis and Trade Management**

### **Monitoring for Upside Potential**

*   Focus is on whether price will trade above the consequent encroachment (midpoint) of a specific wick.
*   Pairing long positions with existing buy stops resting above previous highs.
*   Initial non-farm payroll moves are often "fake moves", but the initial rally is perceived as genuine, not a fake out.

### **Liquidity Considerations**

*   Identified liquidity pools above recent highs.
*   Acknowledged the volatility of non-farm payroll trading and the potential for "gnarly" price action.

### **Potential Limit Order Strategy**

*   If price revisits the consequent encroachment level, a limit order for one contract will be placed.
*   A single contract is used due to uncertainty, avoiding pyramiding strategies on a NFP day.
*   The goal is to secure some profit, even if the trade is ultimately stopped out.
*   **Rationale**: Holding for larger moves is necessary to achieve substantial gains.

### **Risk Management and Psychological Considerations**

*   Acknowledged the potential to leave "7,000-8,000 dollars on the table," but emphasized the importance of holding for potentially large runs.
*   Allowing the market to retrace and take back some gains is part of the process.
*   Securing a small profit covers costs and commissions, and addresses the psychological need for a win.
*   Less than 10 minutes of investment, so having a small piece is affordable.

### **Trade Execution and Stop Loss Adjustment**

*   Limit order was executed.
*   Stop loss adjusted to break even plus commissions and a small profit.
*   Stop loss placement is deliberately below the 4-hour FVG high, recognizing the possibility of a move through this level.

### **Dealer's Hand and Consequent Encroachment**

*   Monitoring for a close above the consequent encroachment level.
*   A close above this level would indicate the "dealer's hand," signaling a likely continuation upwards.
*   Trade management strategy contingent on price action at the target area.

### **Uncertainty and Risk Acknowledgment**

*   Acknowledged the inherent gamble associated with non-farm payroll trading.
*   Prepared for the possibility of being stopped out with only a small profit.
*   Emphasized the value of the experience as a learning opportunity.
*   Highlighted that taking losses is part of trading and that it isn't embarrassing or a sign of inability to trade.

### **Personal Trading Style and Challenges**

*   Non-farm payroll and the day before are identified as personally challenging trading days.
*   Normally avoids active participation on these days due to decreased accuracy and precision.
*   Took the trade to demonstrate concepts and potentially overcome challenges.
*   Reiterated that even the most skilled traders can be wrong, particularly in challenging market conditions.

## **5-Minute Chart and Further Analysis**

### **Consequent Encroachment (CE) Level Importance**

*   Monitoring for a candle close above the consequent encroachment level on the 5-minute chart.
*   A close above this level would suggest the algorithm will target the initial limit order above.

### **Post-Close Analysis and Concerns**

*   Relaxed mindset despite a down-closed candle forming.
*   Evaluated potential downside scenarios, including the possibility of price retracing to a specific candle body, potentially acting as an order block.
*   Concerned that needing to retrace to a discount array lowers probability of success.
*   Ideal scenario: price reaches targets without needing to retrace to a discount array.

### **Understanding Market Strength and Weakness**

*   Balancing PDA awareness with assessing market strength.
*   Stronger price action, reaching targets without retracing to discount arrays, is preferred.

### **Silent Execution Series Context**

*   Referenced a "silent execution" series on YouTube to test strategies.
*   Sharing real-time inner thoughts and decision-making processes.

### **Acceptance of Downside Risk but Preference for Upside Strength**

*   While retracement to the order block is "completely acceptable," stronger upside movement without retracement is preferred.
*   Stronger price action indicates higher energy and confidence in the upside move.

### **Retail vs. Institutional Perspective**

*   Highlighted the informational advantage that institutional traders have over retail traders.
*   Retail traders often lack awareness of market dynamics and target locations.
*   Calmness and lack of surprise reflect experience and familiarity with market patterns.

### **Avoiding Emotional Responses**

*   Prepared for any outcome, whether a significant rally or a stop-out.
*   Avoiding emotional reactions, such as fear or greed, which can lead to poor decisions.

## **Goldbach Levels**

*   No relation to goldbach, just quarters.
*   No association with Enigma.
*   Called out people sewing misinformation.

Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the text, maintaining all original details and nuance, and formatted for readability:

# **ES Futures Trade Analysis: Non-Farm Payroll Friday - Continued Discussion**

## **Trading on Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) Friday: Acknowledging the Challenges**

*   This particular day of the month is characterized by high manipulation.
*   The analysis is presented assuming market conditions *were* normal, setting aside the NFP Friday context.
*   **NFP Disclaimer**: Echoing Linda Raschke, NFP is "not for professionals".
*   Despite uncertainty and the market's unwillingness to rally continuously, profits aren't immediately taken off.
    *   **Rationale**: To demonstrate trading under NFP conditions and highlight the difficulty of managing emotions, risk, and trusting rule-based ideas.

## **Mindset and Perspective**

### **Codified Concepts**

*   Concepts are internally codified and understood intimately.
*   Acceptance that the market may retrace and stop the trade out.
*   This trade isn't the only opportunity for profit.

### **New Trader Pitfalls**

*   New traders often equate their entire career with the results of a single trade.
*   Success should not be measured solely on the outcome of a single trade.
*   **Toxic Mindset**: This approach is a "plague" and creates a toxic mindset.

### **Male Ego and Trading**

*   Trading can be difficult, especially for men, due to the inherent need to "measure up."
*   Trading is not an "Olympic feat" but a business about making money.

### **Business Approach vs. Gambling**

*   Avoid over-leveraging and unrealistic expectations.
*   Running trading as a business, not a gamble.

### **Brick and Mortar Analogy**

*   Relates to a brick and mortar store that sells shoes.
*   Don't worry about unlikely scenarios like people ceasing to wear shoes.
*   There's a fundamental need for shoes; therefore, the market always exists.

### **Model Premise**

*   The PD arrays and models are based on the premise that the market will reach for inefficiencies and liquidity (or vice versa).

### **Lack of Surprise**

*   Not surprised by price action; concern is about following the model and rule-based ideas.
*   Rule-based ideas have been codified, implemented, and used for 30 years.
*   Lack of emotional reaction to price action; describing the experience as "boring."
*   Expected more movement for this particular NFP.

## **5-Minute Chart Analysis and Trade Management**

### **Close Above Analysis**

*   Observed one close above; the following candle did not close above.
*   Demanding price action to show another close above.
*   If it doesn't close above, three contracts will be taken off to fund the position and secure some profit.
*   **Timeframe Preference**: Prefers the 5-minute chart; dislikes the 1-minute chart (too fast).
*   **Timeframe Agnostic**: Price action happens at the same speed across different timeframes.
*   Don't be "imprisoned" by timeframes.

### **Trade Adjustment**

*   Because the 5 minute candle did not close above the level, three contracts were sold to secure profit.
*   Position is now "well funded," making a stop-out irrelevant.
*   More than the average person makes in a week's wage has been made in a few minutes, during a challenging NFP Friday.

### **Order Block Observations**

*   Trading in the deep order block.
*   Expectation that this area should send price higher.
*   Interpretation of price action: all price action here was a raid.
*   Belief that they'll "rip up" into the area to attack short positions.
*   Enticed people to get short but stopped out those already short before 8:30 AM to prevent them from participating in the move.
*   Eliminated the possibility of profitability for anyone short who trailed their stop loss.

### **Stop Loss Strategy**

*   If the market decides to go up, one contract will be taken off right above the high manually.
*   Will not move the stop loss from its current position.
*   Acknowledge leaving "a lot of money on the table."

### **Babysitting the Position**

*   Present and "babysitting" the position due to NFP.
*   After-the-fact questions about leaving money on the table are easy to ask.
*   If you are a trader, you won't take every bit of the profit of every trade you were in either.
*   There will be times you leave money on the table.

### **Long Term Perspective**

*   Not worried about leaving money on the table; that money can be made another day.
*   Looking for larger hauls and bigger harvests.
*   Sometimes the setup doesn't yield its biggest capacity.

### **Losses as Loans**

*   Not measuring success based on one individual transaction or trade.
*   Okay with the market taking some back; it's an "interest loan."
*   Will get it back with interest later on.
*   Looking at losses as a loan given to the marketplace.
*   Someone made money off the money left on the table.

### **Legacy Money Makers**

*   Mindset is different from "one-hit wonders" or day traders counting every penny.
*   Relaxing and letting probabilities do the heavy lifting, following the model.
*   Avoiding over-leveraging and forcing trades.

### **Efficiency Analysis**

*   Watching how price trades between a candle, which is a level in the sand.
*   If it doesn't rally from here, it's likely to retrace back down and touch and maybe trade deeper into the 4-hour fair value gap.

### **Trading Style**

*   When trading (not educating), all the boxes and distractions are removed from the chart.
*   Only the levels themselves (numbers) are used, written down on a notepad.
*   The levels would otherwise become distracting.

### **Unscripted Commentary**

*   Referencing Twitter Spaces rants; unless explicitly stated, commentary is unscripted.
*   Easily distracted by different tangents and rabbit trails.
*   Bringing in multiple subjects that stray from the main topic.
*   Acknowledging that this style can be difficult for some listeners.

### **Thought Process**

*   Mind works at 1,000 miles per hour; "if you can't keep up, then stay on the porch."
*   Recognizing this as a weakness in mentoring; hard to stay on task about one subject.
*   Bored easily; many other things to talk about in price action.
*   Leaving out many details because they can't be taught.

### **Irrelevant Opinions**

*   Could put out new models every month that all make money, but people will still try to discount them.
*   Always going to be someone with an opinion.
*   All of that is irrelevant.

### **Core Questions**

*   Are you making money with what is being taught?
*   Are you understanding what price action is about to do next?
*   If it isn't helping, don't watch.
*   If it's complicated, understand that you were already told it would be.

### **Indicator Criticism**

*   Criticizes indicator-based trading (overbought/oversold).
*   Indicators have "absolutely no bearing" on what price is going to do.
*   Moving averages, harmonic patterns, none of that makes price go up or down.
*   Buying and selling pressure is a "myth."
*   Depth of Market (DOM) means "absolutely nothing" because it can be spoofed.

### **Spoofing Explanation**

*   "Spoofing" involves flashing orders to create a false impression of buying or selling interest.
*   Large institutions (e.g., Goldman Sachs, Citi) have been punished for spoofing.
*   It takes more faith to believe in that than it does to simply look at where the stops should be and where are the inefficiencies.
*   They can't hide inefficiencies from you.
*   Advantage: everyone will have a stop loss when the market drops.
*   We don't need to know how many people are short or their entities; we know they're short.
*   They will place a protective stop in the form of a buy stop above some important high.
*   Based the remaining portion of this trade on the idea that there's unfinished business above.

### **High Targets**

*   If they get really overzealous on the upside, they can take it up.
*   Enough "in the tank" to adjust if it starts running up.
*   Nonfarm payroll is a challenging market environment where there is not faith in ability to be very precise in non-farm payroll Market structure.
*   It's "quirky" and "wild", and it whips around in an "aimless" fashion.
*   Can't trust building larger positions with sound footing; too uncertain to build larger positions on this day due to high manipulation of order flow.

### **Final Thoughts**

*   That's the situation constantly for the first.


Okay, here is the organized and refined version of the text, maintaining all original details and nuance, and formatted for readability:

# **ES Futures Trade Analysis: Non-Farm Payroll Friday - Continued Trade Management**

## **Trade Update and Rationale**

*   During the first hour, market conditions are highly manipulated.
*   Acknowledging elements that would normally be trusted in market delivery are less reliable.
*   Previously guided the audience through the analysis of the current area of price action.
*   Because price action did not develop as anticipated, additional contracts were sold.
    *   **Initial Position**: 10 contracts were available from the original entry.
    *   **Profit Taking**: One contract was initially sold, followed by three more due to unfavorable price action.
*   Observing price action within the last down-closed candle and inside the fair value gap.
*   Currently watching to see if the candle body closes below or outside the shaded blue/green area.
*   **Dog Interruption**: Mention of "Piper snorm," one of three female Boxer dogs.
    *   Clarification that all dogs are female, addressing potential misidentification in comments.
    *   Emphasis that the dogs are not bred for puppies.
*   Ideal scenario: the current or next candle gains upside momentum and exits the green shaded area.
*   **Risk Assessment**: The longer price remains in the current area, the higher the probability of retracing back down to the top of the 4-hour chart fair value gap.
*   **Trade Funding**: The position is "funded," meaning that any potential stop-out will not result in a loss for the day.
    *   **Rationale**: Profits have already been secured, eliminating the risk of a negative outcome.
    *   **Psychological Benefit**: Prevents a negative trading experience from affecting the weekend.
*   Expressing amusement at individuals who criticize taking partial profits, especially anonymous figures on Twitter.
*   Observing that bodies of candles are remaining at the bottom of the green box.
*   Current candle opened at the low of the shaded area and is moving upwards.

*   Acknowledging potential stop-out but expressing acceptance, emphasizing that it is "okay."
*   Removing Fibonacci retracement tool to declutter the chart.
*   **Dog Interruption**: Reference to dog snoring and addressing potential misinterpretation as flatulence.

*   Acknowledging the risk of a downward move to take out the 9:30 AM low before a potential rally.
*   Emphasizing that this potential scenario is not causing undue stress or concern.
*   **Benefits of Partial Profit Taking**: Frees the mind from the need to be "right."
    *   **Power and Strength**: Partial profit-taking eliminates the pressure to be correct.
*   Referencing Larry Williams' teaching that traders are "never right."
    *   **Focus**: Emphasizing profitability, not correctness.
*   The notion of maximizing gains is a "toxic thinking" and will lead to never being "right."
*   Trying to be right is foolish because right is defined by maximizing gains.

*   Level 2 data is a gimmick, and it's the same thing as the depth of markets.
*   Candlestick patterns being inefficiencies can't be spoofed, but the Dom can be spoofed.
*   Liquidity above certain high's can't be spoofed.
*   Bookmap software isn't needed to see stop losses.
*   Aids in the beginning make sense, but eventually, you are going to outgrow them.
*   The things on the chart are to show concerns, importance, and focus.
*   Trading charts look naked with no boxes, which is the focus.
*   The same levels on the charts are on a notepad.
*   Monitoring price every few minutes and minutes, consciously.
*   Market opens and CNBC claps, but it isn't buying and selling pressure.
*   Rush and stop losses that get hit is the order flow and when that stop loss gets hit, it is flooding the market with sell orders.
